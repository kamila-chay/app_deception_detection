Observing the individual's behavior, there are a few subtle cues that could initially raise some questions. The downward movement of the chin and the shifting gaze, both downward and sideways, might sometimes be interpreted as signs of discomfort or evasion, which in some contexts could suggest deception. Additionally, the crossing of fingers is often considered a classic gesture linked to withholding full honesty.

However, it's important to consider that such behaviors are not definitive indicators of lying on their own. The downward chin movement could simply reflect a moment of thoughtfulness or self-reflection rather than an attempt to deceive. Similarly, the gaze shifting may indicate that the person is recalling information or processing the question carefully. Crossing fingers might be a habitual or subconscious gesture rather than a deliberate sign of deceit.

Weighing both possibilities, while certain behaviors might superficially align with signs traditionally associated with lying, the overall context and subtlety of these actions lean more toward a genuine expression rather than intentional falsehood. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is telling the truth, even though some of their nonverbal cues could be misread in isolation.

Observing the person's behavior in the video, they consistently direct their gaze toward the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and openness. However, there are moments when their gaze shifts downward, which some might interpret as a sign of discomfort or evasiveness. Yet, this downward glance could just as easily reflect a natural pause for thought or reflection, rather than an attempt to deceive. Their head remains mostly up, which tends to convey confidence rather than concealment.

Considering these behaviors together, the combination of maintaining eye contact, occasional downward gaze, and a raised head posture leans more toward truthfulness. If the person were lying, one might expect more avoidance of direct eye contact or more defensive body language. Of course, without additional context, it’s hard to be absolutely certain, but given these cues, it seems reasonable to suggest that the person is indeed being truthful.

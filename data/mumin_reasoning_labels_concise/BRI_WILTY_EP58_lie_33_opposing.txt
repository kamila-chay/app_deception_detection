Watching the video, the person's behavior caught my attention, especially their gaze and subtle head movements. They frequently shifted their gaze sideways rather than maintaining steady eye contact, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct scrutiny. At the same time, they did nod occasionally, which might be interpreted as trying to affirm what they're saying or to appear more agreeable and convincing.

Now, these cues alone aren’t definitive signs of deception—people may naturally look away when thinking or nod to show engagement regardless of truthfulness. For instance, sideways glances might just be the person gathering their thoughts, and nodding could simply reflect a desire to maintain rapport with the interlocutor.

However, considering the combination of these behaviors together, it leans toward a likelihood that the person is being truthful. The sideways gaze coupled with the nodding feels natural and reflective, as if they’re managing their demeanor to stay engaged while carefully considering their responses. While it’s not impossible they could be deceptive, the overall impression, grounded in these subtle nonverbal cues, suggests they are likely conveying honest information.

Observing the subject’s behavior throughout the video, several subtle cues stand out that could initially suggest discomfort or hesitation. For instance, the repeated frowning of the eyebrows and the frequent blinking may imply nervousness, which is sometimes interpreted as a sign of deceit. Additionally, the downward movement of the lip corners and occasional upward movement of the chin could be read as defensive or uncertain gestures. The head movements—both backward and side turns—might indicate a desire to distance oneself or evade direct scrutiny. At the same time, the gaze behavior seems mixed: there are moments when the subject looks directly at the interlocutor, which is often a sign of engagement, but also periods where their gaze drops downward, potentially conveying introspection or unease.

Yet, when considering these cues in context, one could argue they strongly indicate dishonesty. Nervousness and tension can arise from many factors, but when these behaviors align with the combination of head and lip movements, they often signal an attempt to conceal the truth. The mixture of direct gaze and downward looks might reflect conflict between wanting to engage and simultaneously hiding something. Likewise, gestures like chin lift or head tilts could be protective postures meant to deflect scrutiny.

Balancing these points, my assessment leans toward the subject being deceptive despite some behaviors that might superficially appear open. The inconsistent eye contact and the guarded variation in head movements suggest avoidance rather than transparency. Thus, while some behavioral signs may hint at uncertainty, they collectively provide strong evidence of deception here, making the conclusion that the person is lying a reasonable and informed estimate.

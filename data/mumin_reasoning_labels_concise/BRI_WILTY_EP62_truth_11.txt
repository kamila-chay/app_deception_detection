Watching the video closely, the person's behavior appears fairly consistent with someone speaking honestly. Their gaze occasionally shifts upwards, which could suggest they are recalling information or accessing memories rather than fabricating details on the spot. This subtle eye movement often aligns with genuine attempts to retrieve accurate information. Additionally, the slight head tilting seems more like a natural, thoughtful reaction rather than a sign of discomfort or deceit.

Of course, these behaviors aren't definitive proof of truthfulness. One could argue that gaze shifting or head tilting might also be nervous tics or attempts to avoid direct eye contact, which sometimes happen during deception. However, in this context, the overall demeanor seems relaxed rather than overly guarded or evasive. Taken together, the cues imply that the person is likely telling the truth, though it's always worth considering that nonverbal signals can vary widely depending on individual differences and situational factors.

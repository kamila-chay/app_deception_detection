Watching the video, the person maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, which generally suggests engagement and openness. They also nod during the conversation, a gesture often associated with agreement or reassurance, which could imply sincerity. Additionally, the person leans their head forward slightly, a behavior that might indicate interest or an attempt to emphasize their point.

At first glance, these behaviors might suggest that the individual is being deceptive. Direct eye contact and nodding typically signal honesty and confidence. However, these same cues can also be consciously employed by someone trying to convince or manipulate their listener. For example, deliberate nodding and steady gaze might be used to project credibility and distract from inconsistencies in their statement.

Taking all this into account, while the person's behavior outwardly appears consistent with potential manipulation, the possibility that these are genuine gestures reflecting honesty cannot be discounted. The careful gaze and affirmative head movements might be natural behaviors, consciously or unconsciously employed to communicate truthfulness. Therefore, although the evidence is subtle and somewhat ambiguous, I lean towards the assessment that the person is likely being entirely truthful, given the combination of these behaviors in the context of the interaction.

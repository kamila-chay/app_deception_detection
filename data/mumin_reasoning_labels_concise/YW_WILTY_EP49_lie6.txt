Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, the smile suggested by the lip corners turning up and maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor might give an impression of openness and engagement, which are typically signs of honesty and confidence. The openness in their posture, indicated by arms being open and palms up, often signals a willingness to communicate and transparency.

However, there are also elements that raise some doubts about the veracity of their statements. The head shaking, while making eye contact and smiling, can be somewhat contradictory—shaking one’s head typically indicates disagreement or denial, but combined with other signals of openness, it may suggest a subtle attempt to convince or distract rather than convey truth. This mix of signals can sometimes be seen in someone who is trying hard to appear truthful but may be uncomfortable with the actual content, leading to such incongruences.

Taking all this into account, while the openness and gaze might point towards honesty on the surface, the inconsistency introduced by the head shaking makes me lean towards the conclusion that the person is not being entirely truthful. It feels like they are putting effort into appearing honest, but some nonverbal slips suggest an underlying deception. That said, it's always important to consider that behavioral cues alone aren’t definitive proof, and context would clarify matters further. Nonetheless, based on what’s observed here, the evidence tips slightly more in favor of the individual lying.

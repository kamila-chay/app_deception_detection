Watching the video, the person seems to direct their gaze upward at certain points during their speech. This kind of eye movement can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of accessing visual memory or imagination, which in some contexts people associate with fabrication or evasion. However, it is important to consider that upward gaze is not definitive proof of dishonesty; it can just as well indicate thoughtful reflection or the process of recalling information.

Given the individual’s overall demeanor and the lack of other overt signs of deception, it feels reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that they are truthful. The upward gaze might simply be a part of their natural cognitive process as they articulate their thoughts. Of course, without additional behavioral cues or inconsistencies, it’s difficult to be absolutely certain. Still, balancing the available evidence, the behavior observed aligns more closely with genuine truth-telling rather than deceit.

Watching the video, I observed a number of behaviors that shed some light on the person's honesty. The individual frequently raises their eyebrows, which can often indicate openness or surprise, rather than evasion. Their lip corners tend to lift slightly, suggesting a subtle smile that might reflect comfort or sincerity rather than discomfort or deceit. Their gaze is often directed towards the interlocutor, implying engagement and a willingness to connect, though there are moments when their gaze shifts downward, which sometimes can hint at nervousness or contemplation.

Moreover, the person tends to tilt their head occasionally, a gesture that often accompanies genuine interest or empathy rather than calculative deception. While some of these signs, such as looking down, might cause a skeptic to question their truthfulness, in the context of all observed behaviors combined, these subtleties seem to raise doubts about honesty. Taken together, these nonverbal cues lean towards a person who may not be telling the truth, even though there is always room to consider alternative interpretations. Overall, my educated guess is that the individual is being deceptive, based on these nuanced behaviors.

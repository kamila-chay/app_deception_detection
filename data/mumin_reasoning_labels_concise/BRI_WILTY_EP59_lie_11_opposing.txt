Watching the video, the person's behavior gives mixed signals that make it challenging to draw a definitive conclusion at first glance. They frequently raise their eyebrows, which can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to engage the listener more earnestly. Their gaze mostly stays directed towards the interlocutor, suggesting a level of confidence or at least an attempt to maintain connection and credibility. However, there are noticeable moments when their gaze shifts sideways, which can often be interpreted as a sign of discomfort, distraction, or even evasion.

Considering these factors together, it seems plausible that the person is being truthful. The combination of sustained eye contact with occasional sideways glances could suggest they are trying to manage how they are perceived, balancing the need to appear trustworthy while simultaneously feeling uneasy about their own statements. The raised eyebrows, while potentially signaling engagement, might also be a subtle cue to emphasize sincerity, which can happen when someone is genuinely communicating important information.

Of course, these behaviors are not definitive proof of truthfulness—raising eyebrows and gaze shifts can depend on personality, cultural background, or context. Yet, in this scenario, the interplay between these signals hints at a consistency typical of honesty. On balance, while there is room for other interpretations, the evidence leans reasonably towards the person being fully truthful.

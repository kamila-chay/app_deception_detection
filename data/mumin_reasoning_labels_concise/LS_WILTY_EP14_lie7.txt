Watching the video, I notice several subtle cues that might suggest the person is not being entirely truthful. Their lip corners are lifted slightly, which could indicate a controlled or forced smile rather than a genuine expression—sometimes people do this when trying to mask discomfort. Additionally, there are moments when the chin moves upward, possibly signaling a brief attempt to assert confidence, but this is followed by the chin moving downward, which can reveal hesitation or insecurity. The gaze directed downwards also tends to reflect a level of avoidance or internal conflict that might come up when someone is fabricating information.

Of course, it’s possible these behaviors could stem from nervousness or shyness rather than intentional deceit. People often show similar physical reactions under stress even when telling the truth. However, the combination of controlled facial expressions, fluctuating chin movements, and downward gaze together raises a reasonable suspicion that the person might be concealing something. While none of these signs alone definitively prove lying, taken together, they point toward the likelihood that the individual is not fully honest in this instance.

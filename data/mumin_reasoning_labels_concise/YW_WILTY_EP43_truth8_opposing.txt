Watching the video, the person’s behavior appears quite consistent with someone who is being deceptive, though it’s important to acknowledge that interpreting nonverbal cues alone can sometimes be tricky. The individual frequently raises their eyebrows, which can be a sign of openness or surprise—both of which might also be used strategically to create a false impression. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and a willingness to connect, which sometimes can be a tactic to avoid suspicion rather than a sign of honesty.

Additionally, the nodding and slight head tilting give an impression of attentiveness and receptiveness, behaviors that can be consciously adopted to appear more convincing. The palms up gesture is another notable behavior; it is commonly interpreted as a signal of honesty or openness, but it could also be a deliberate attempt to metaphorically show that they have nothing to hide.

Of course, none of these behaviors alone can definitively prove deceit—people can also display such signals naturally or as part of personal habits. However, taken together, the combination of these subtle cues leans more towards the person attempting to conceal information rather than communicating earnestly. While it’s never possible to be absolutely certain without corroborating evidence, the observed behaviors in this case reasonably support the idea that the person is not telling the truth.

Watching the video closely, there are several subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest a level of discomfort or hesitation, which might imply they are being truthful. For instance, slight and frequent blinking can often indicate increased cognitive load or stress, common when someone is trying to recall truthful information. Additionally, the upward movement of the chin combined with occasional head tilting and side-turning might signal an attempt to engage thoughtfully with the conversation or to process their genuine feelings.

However, it's worth considering that these behaviors can also stem from nervousness or natural idiosyncrasies in communication, especially if the person feels scrutinized or under pressure, regardless of the truthfulness of their statements. The gaze dynamics, shifting between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking sideways, add an element of social engagement but also possible contemplation.

Taking all these observations together, while none of these gestures alone are definitive proof of honesty, the combination and context make a compelling case for the person likely being truthful. The subtle tension and body language patterns align with behaviors typically associated with sincere communication, so it seems reasonable to conclude the person is probably telling the truth, albeit with some room for alternative explanations.

Watching the person in the video, I noticed several subtle cues that caught my attention. Their eyebrows occasionally raised, which can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty. The lip corners lifted slightly, suggesting a mild smile or an effort to appear more agreeable. Their gaze frequently shifted towards the person they were speaking with, which often signals engagement and openness. However, I also observed moments where their eyes drifted sideways, a behavior that might hint at discomfort or evasiveness. The nodding seemed consistent, possibly reinforcing what they were saying.

On one hand, these behaviors—raised eyebrows, slight smiling, and direct gaze—are typically associated with sincerity and confidence. The person's apparent effort to maintain eye contact and the occasional nodding might be signs that they believe what they’re saying or want to convince their listener.

On the other hand, the sideways gaze introduces some uncertainty. It might reflect internal conflict or hesitation, often seen in individuals who are not completely forthcoming. Sometimes, small smiles paired with inconsistent eye contact can be a veneer masking underlying insincerity.

Balancing these observations, I lean toward the interpretation that the person is not entirely truthful. The combination of seemingly genuine engagement mixed with subtle avoidant gestures suggests they might be trying to mask deception. While none of these indicators alone conclusively prove lying, their interplay in this context points to some level of dishonesty. So, while I can’t be absolutely certain, my educated guess is that the person is likely lying.

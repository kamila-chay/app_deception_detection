Upon observing the person in the video, there are subtle cues that suggest a possibility of deception, though it’s not entirely definitive. One notable behavior is the raising of the eyebrows, which can sometimes signal surprise or a fleeting attempt to seek reassurance. In the context of someone who might be lying, it could indicate a momentary reaction to the tension of fabricating information or an unconscious effort to appear sincere.

However, raising eyebrows alone isn’t a surefire indicator of dishonesty. This gesture can just as easily be a natural response to recalling information or expressing curiosity, rather than a direct sign of falsehood. Without additional supporting behaviors—such as inconsistencies in speech or other nonverbal cues—it’s difficult to be certain.

That said, given the context and the subtle unease conveyed through their expression, it’s reasonable to lean toward the interpretation that the person is not being completely truthful. The eyebrow raise might be part of a broader pattern of trying to manage discomfort or mask the lie. While this is an educated guess rather than a conclusive judgment, the available information points more toward deception than honesty.

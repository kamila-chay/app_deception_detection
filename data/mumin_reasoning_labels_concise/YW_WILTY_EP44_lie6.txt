Watching the video of this individual, there are several behavioral cues that stand out and give some insight into their state of mind. The person frequently smiles, and their lip corners lift, which might suggest a degree of comfort or perhaps an attempt to appear friendly and open. Their eyebrows are raised at times, and the chin moves upwards, both of which could be interpreted as signs of confidence or engagement. Additionally, the gaze shifts between looking directly at the interlocutor, then upwards, and sideways, which creates a mixed picture.

On one hand, maintaining eye contact typically signals honesty and openness, so the direct gaze might suggest the person is being truthful. The smile and raised eyebrows also might be genuine expressions of positive emotion. However, the shifts in gaze to the sides or upwards introduce some ambiguity—these kinds of gaze aversions are often associated with cognitive load or discomfort, which can happen when someone is fabricating information.

Considering these factors, it’s plausible that the individual is managing their facial expressions consciously, perhaps trying to project sincerity while internally feeling uneasy. The mix of direct gaze alongside these subtle avoidance cues, combined with the somewhat forced nature of the upward chin movement, may indicate an attempt to mask deception. While none of these signs alone definitively prove dishonesty, together they suggest the person might not be entirely truthful in this context. So, weighing the evidence, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely lying, even though there's no absolute certainty.

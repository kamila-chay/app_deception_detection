Watching the video carefully, the person's overall demeanor seems to support the impression that they are lying. One notable behavior is the subtle head shaking, which typically might be interpreted as a sign of disagreement or confusion. In some contexts, frequent or exaggerated head shaking could suggest discomfort or an attempt to obscure the truth. However, in this case, the shaking is restrained and appears more like a natural, perhaps even reflexive, gesture to emphasize a point rather than a signal of deceit.

It’s important to consider that people often use head movements to communicate sincerity or to reinforce their statements. Since the individual is speaking calmly without signs of nervousness, such as fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the head shaking here might serve as a nonverbal cue that contrasts with their verbal message, underlining their dishonesty. Although it’s always possible to misread such gestures, in the presence of subtle discrepancies, the evidence leans toward them being deceptive.

That said, we must acknowledge that interpreting subtle body language is not foolproof, and cultural or personal habits could influence gestures like head shaking differently. Yet, given the context and the incongruence between verbal and nonverbal signals, the most reasonable conclusion seems to be that the person is lying.

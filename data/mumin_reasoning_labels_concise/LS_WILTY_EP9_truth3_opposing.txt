Watching the video, the person exhibits several behaviors that suggest a disengaged and deceptive demeanor. Their eyebrows alternate between frowning and raising, which could indicate they are overthinking their responses and reacting unnaturally to the conversation. The steady gaze towards the interlocutor, paired with subtle nodding, might give a misleading impression of active listening and sincerity. The slight head tilting and occasional turning might reflect attempts to manipulate perception or avoid direct answers, rather than genuine curiosity or attempts to understand the discussion more deeply.

Of course, some of these behaviors, like frowning eyebrows or head turning, can also be interpreted as signs of genuine engagement or processing information in certain contexts, which might support truthfulness. However, these gestures can just as easily be signs of discomfort or evasion. When considered together, the combination of mutual gaze, nodding, and natural head movements leans more towards deceit rather than authenticity.

Given these observations, while it’s not possible to be absolutely certain without more context, the behavioral clues present a reasonable case for the person being untruthful. Their manner seems more consistent with someone who is evasive or deceptive, rather than engaged and honest.

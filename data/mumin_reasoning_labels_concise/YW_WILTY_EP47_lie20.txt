Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that make the assessment a bit challenging but lean toward the possibility of deceit. At times, there’s an upward movement of the eyebrows and a slight smile, which could be interpreted as attempts to appear friendly or sincere. Their gaze toward the interlocutor suggests engagement and perhaps an effort to establish trust or credibility. However, there are moments when their gaze shifts downward, which might indicate discomfort or hesitation, often associated with withholding information or fabricating details.

On the one hand, raising eyebrows and smiling could be genuine signs of openness, and maintaining eye contact can sometimes reflect honesty rather than deceit. Still, the intermittent downward gaze seems less consistent with truthful communication, especially when combined with other subtle cues. Altogether, while these behaviors might also be explained by nervousness or social anxiety, considering the mix of signals—particularly the fluctuating gaze and somewhat forced smile—it's reasonable to lean toward the interpretation that the person isn’t being entirely truthful. This is, of course, an educated guess rather than a definitive conclusion, but the signs point in that direction given the context.

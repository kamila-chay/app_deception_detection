Watching the video, the person’s behavior initially suggests openness, especially with their steady gaze directed toward the interlocutor. This kind of eye contact often implies engagement and confidence, which can be indicative of honesty. However, the occasional upward gaze could introduce some ambiguity. Sometimes, people look upward when trying to recall information or perhaps to construct a response, which might raise questions about the spontaneity or veracity of their statements.

That said, these behaviors don’t necessarily point to deception. The combination of maintaining eye contact while briefly looking upward could simply reflect a natural effort to access memories or consider their words carefully, rather than an attempt to fabricate or withhold the truth. If the person were lying, one might expect more avoidant behavior or inconsistent gazes rather than this measured pattern.

Overall, while it’s prudent to remain cautious and recognize that gaze patterns alone aren’t foolproof indicators, this person’s demeanor leans more toward sincerity. The engagement with the interlocutor, paired with thoughtful moments of upward gaze, suggests they are likely telling the truth rather than intentionally misleading.

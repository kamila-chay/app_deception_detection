Watching the video, the person's behavior seems to suggest some level of discomfort or unease, which could be indicative of truthfulness. The way their lips retract and the slight upward movement of the chin might signal defensiveness or an attempt to assert control, which are sometimes seen when someone is being candid and standing their ground. Their gaze towards the interlocutor is noticeable—it’s steady rather than evasive, which usually supports honesty, as truthful individuals often maintain direct eye contact. However, some individuals consciously maintain eye contact to appear more sincere.

The subtle head shaking adds a layer of complexity; it could imply disagreement or internal conflict with what they’re stating, possibly hinting at an underlying truth they are trying to convey despite hesitation. Additionally, the hands touching various parts of the body and the palms facing upward can be signs of nervousness or a subconscious plea for acceptance, both of which align with honest behavior in stressful situations. That said, these gestures might also stem from nervousness unrelated to dishonesty, such as anxiety in a high-pressure situation.

Taking everything into account, while none of these behaviors alone guarantees truthfulness, their combination—the defensive lip and chin movements, nervous hand gestures, and conflicted head shaking—leans towards the person telling the truth. It’s important to acknowledge the possibility that these could be reactions to stress or discomfort not connected to deception, but given the cues and their interplay, it seems more plausible they are expressing genuine feelings.

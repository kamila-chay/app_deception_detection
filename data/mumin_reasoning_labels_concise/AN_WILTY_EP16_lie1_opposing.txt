Watching the video, it’s clear that the person exhibits a somewhat conflicted set of nonverbal cues that can be interpreted in different ways. For instance, their gaze shifts towards the interlocutor at times, which might suggest engagement and honesty, as direct eye contact often signals confidence and openness. However, this is complicated by moments when the person looks down or turns their head to the side, behaviors that can indicate discomfort or a desire to avoid scrutiny. These latter signs often align with someone feeling uneasy or possibly deceptive.

That said, none of these behaviors are definitive on their own—people might look away or turn their head simply because they are gathering their thoughts or feeling nervous without necessarily being untruthful. But taken together, especially when paired with the inconsistent gaze patterns, these subtle signals tend to support the person’s honesty rather than undermine it. While it’s important to remain cautious about overinterpreting such cues, the combination of engagement behavior followed by avoidance suggests an internal conflict that leans toward the person being truthful despite some discomfort. Therefore, based on the interplay of these behaviors, it is reasonable to cautiously infer that the person is likely telling the truth.

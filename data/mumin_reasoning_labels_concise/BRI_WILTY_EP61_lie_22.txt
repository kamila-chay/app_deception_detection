Watching the video of the individual, there are subtle cues that suggest some level of discomfort or evasion. One notable behavior is the tendency to look upward while speaking. This gaze shift can sometimes indicate that the person is searching for information or constructing a response rather than recalling a straightforward memory. It isn’t definitive proof of dishonesty on its own, as people often look up when thinking, or even out of habit. However, in this context, considering the nature of the conversation and the moment of hesitation that coincides with the gaze shift, it raises the possibility that the person may be fabricating or altering details.

On the other hand, one could argue that looking upward is simply a cognitive gesture linked to visualization or mental calculation, especially if the topic requires recalling complex or less familiar information. Not everyone exhibits the same nonverbal signs of lying, so this sign should be interpreted cautiously.

Balancing these perspectives, the combination of the upward gaze with the timing and context of the responses leans toward the conclusion that the person is not being fully honest. While this is not an ironclad certainty, the behavior aligns with patterns often associated with deception, making it a reasonable, albeit tentative, judgment.

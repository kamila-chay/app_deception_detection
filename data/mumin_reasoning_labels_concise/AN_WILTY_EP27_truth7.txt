Watching the video, the person's behavior offers mixed but mostly reassuring signals when considering truthfulness. The way they raise their eyebrows could be interpreted in a few ways—sometimes it suggests surprise or emphasis, which might align with someone striving to be sincere. Their gaze toward the interlocutor also typically indicates engagement and a willingness to be open, which often supports honesty. On the other hand, the gaze upward might raise a slight question as it can sometimes be associated with searching for a fabricated answer or recalling a constructed story. However, this isn't definitive since people also glanced upward when genuinely trying to remember details. The open arms posture generally conveys openness and lack of defensiveness, which would be unusual if someone were trying to hide the truth.

Balancing these observations, it seems more likely the person is telling the truth, especially given their open posture and direct eye contact. While the gaze upward introduces a hint of uncertainty, it doesn't strongly contradict the other behaviors that suggest sincerity. Overall, my reasoned impression leans toward honesty, but I acknowledge there's a small margin where these signals could be ambiguous.

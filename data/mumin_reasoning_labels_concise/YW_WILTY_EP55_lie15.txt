Watching the video, I noticed a few intriguing behavioral cues that suggest the person might not be telling the truth. There was frequent blinking, which can sometimes be associated with cognitive load or stress—both of which might occur when someone is fabricating a story. The person's gaze alternated between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways. This mixture of eye contact and side glances could indicate an attempt to appear engaged while simultaneously trying to avoid full eye contact, a behavior often linked to discomfort or deception.

That said, none of these signs are definitive proof of lying on their own. For example, frequent blinking can also result from nervousness in a high-pressure situation, not necessarily dishonesty. Similarly, shifting gaze might be a natural response to thinking or recalling memories rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive. However, when these behaviors occur together, especially alongside the context of the conversation, it raises a reasonable suspicion.

Considering the combination of these subtle cues and the context, it seems more likely than not that the person is not being truthful. While it's important to remain cautious and not jump to conclusions, the body language exhibited here aligns with patterns commonly observed when individuals are lying.

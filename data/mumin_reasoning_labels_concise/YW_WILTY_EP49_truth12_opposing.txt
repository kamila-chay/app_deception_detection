Observing the person's behavior in the video, certain cues stand out that suggest they are likely being deceptive. Their gaze consistently focuses on the interlocutor, which can sometimes indicate engagement, but in this context may be a deliberate attempt to manipulate or feign openness. Maintaining eye contact can also be a tactic used by deceptive individuals to appear sincere and conceal their true intentions or feelings. Additionally, the individual’s open palm gestures, while typically associated with honesty and openness, can also be consciously employed as a strategy to signal a lack of concealment or threat and thus mask deceit.

That said, it is important to consider that these behaviors, while suggestive of deception, are not definitive proof. Some individuals are naturally inclined to maintain eye contact and use open gestures regardless of their truthfulness, and context always matters. However, given the coherence of these behavioral cues in this scenario, they collectively support an interpretation that the person is likely being untruthful. Overall, while one can never be absolutely certain based solely on nonverbal signals, the evidence here leans toward deceptive communication.

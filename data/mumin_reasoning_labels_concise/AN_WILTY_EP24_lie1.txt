Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests a certain level of discomfort or evasiveness, which often correlates with deception, though it’s not definitive on its own. At times, their gaze is directed straight toward the interlocutor, which can indicate engagement and honesty. However, this steady eye contact might also be a deliberate effort to appear truthful, a common tactic people use when attempting to convince others. On the other hand, moments where the person looks sideways and turns their head slightly could signal hesitation or a desire to avoid direct confrontation, both of which might point to some internal conflict associated with lying.

Of course, it’s important to consider that gaze aversion and head movements can also happen for reasons unrelated to deception—such as thinking through an answer carefully, nervousness unrelated to lying, or simply feeling uneasy under scrutiny. These behaviors alone aren’t ironclad proof of dishonesty. Yet, when putting the pieces together—the mixture of direct gaze combined with brief side glances and a subtle head turn—the pattern leans toward the person not being fully forthcoming. While it’s impossible to say with absolute certainty just from these cues, the balance of evidence suggests that the individual is likely withholding the truth or fabricating it to some extent.

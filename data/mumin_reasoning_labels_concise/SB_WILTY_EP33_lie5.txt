Watching the video carefully, the person's behavior reveals several subtle but telling signs that suggest they might not be telling the truth. There is a noticeable smile and occasional laughter, which initially could be interpreted as genuine friendliness or ease. However, these expressions seem a bit forced rather than spontaneous, lacking the warmth typically associated with sincere enjoyment. The way their chin moves—sometimes upward and at other times downward—could indicate a mix of confidence and uncertainty, as if they are trying to appear composed while internally questioning their own narrative.

Their gaze is quite telling as well. While they often look directly at the interlocutor, which might suggest honesty, they also frequently shift their gaze upwards and sideways. Such movements can be subconscious attempts to access memories or fabricate details, potentially pointing to deceit. The person's head movements, including nodding and tilting, appear somewhat exaggerated, possibly to reinforce their statements but unintentionally drawing attention to the effort they are making.

Additionally, there are moments when the individual rubs their hands or touches their head and body. These self-soothing gestures might indicate discomfort or stress, which aligns with someone who is not fully comfortable with what they’re saying. Although these behaviors alone do not conclusively prove deception, the combination — somewhat forced smiles, inconsistent chin movements, evasive gaze patterns, and self-comforting actions — strongly leans toward the conclusion that the person is not being entirely truthful.

That said, it's important to consider that some people naturally exhibit these behaviors due to nervousness or personality traits, rather than deceit. Yet, given the pattern and context here, the evidence tilts the balance toward the individual likely lying, even if we're not dealing with a perfect or absolute certainty.

Observing this individual's behavior, particularly their gaze direction, offers some insight into their state of mind and honesty. Notably, the person looks upward during their communication. Some theories in psychology suggest that looking up can be associated with accessing visual memories or constructing images, which might indicate fabrication in certain contexts. However, this interpretation is not definitive—people often look up naturally when thinking or recalling information without intending to deceive.

Given that the person is demonstrating signs of dishonesty, it makes sense to consider that their upward gaze here may be tied to constructing images or fabricating details rather than recalling accurate memories. The presence of other subtle suspicious behaviors supports this likelihood, suggesting that their nonverbal cues align more with deception than genuine reflection. While it’s tempting to view upward glances as innocent in isolation, considering the full context and recognizing individual differences in behavior leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is being untruthful in this case.

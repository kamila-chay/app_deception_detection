Watching the person's behavior carefully, several cues stand out that suggest a complex emotional state. The raised eyebrows and exaggerated eye opening could imply surprise or a heightened level of engagement, which might sometimes be interpreted as signs of discomfort or deceit. At the same time, the slight upward turn at the corners of the lips suggests a degree of positive emotion or sincerity, though it could also be a social smile rather than one born from genuine feeling. The lips being retracted and the downward and sideways shifts of gaze might be indicators of nervousness or uncertainty, which could raise doubts about the truthfulness of their statements.

However, these behaviors are not definitive markers of lying on their own. People often exhibit such expressions during earnest attempts to recall details or when they feel the pressure of being observed closely. Nervousness, reflected in changes of gaze and facial tension, does not always equate to deception. Considering this, although there are behaviors that might traditionally signal dishonesty, they can also be explained by natural reactions to social scrutiny or the cognitive load of telling a story accurately.

Taking all of this into account, while ambiguity remains and one could argue both ways, the balance of evidence leans slightly toward the person telling the truth. The subtle positive affect combined with responses typical of someone under mild stress or excitement suggests sincerity rather than manipulation. It feels reasonable to conclude that the person is likely being truthful, even though some behaviors might superficially appear suspicious.

Watching the video, I notice that the person’s gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and then briefly shifting downward. This pattern of eye movement is intriguing because it could suggest a tension between engagement and discomfort. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and honesty, while looking down might indicate a moment of reflection or hesitation. However, the quick shifts between these gazes might also be interpreted as signs of cognitive load or the person trying to regulate their emotional response.

If the person were lying, one might expect a more inconsistent gaze pattern—either avoiding eye contact entirely or exhibiting unnatural glances, not this somewhat oscillating behavior. The downward looks could be attempts to gather their thoughts honestly or reflect on the question, signaling internal processing rather than deceit. At the same time, it is worth considering that some individuals naturally look down when thinking or gathering their thoughts, which doesn’t necessarily imply dishonesty.

Putting these observations together, the combination of direct gaze and moments of downward gaze, along with subtle signs of discomfort, leans toward the interpretation that the person is being truthful. While it’s difficult to be absolutely certain based solely on these cues, the overall impression is that the behavior aligns more closely with someone who is openly sharing their thoughts rather than concealing the truth.

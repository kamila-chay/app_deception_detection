Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that could suggest they are not being entirely truthful, though there is room for alternative interpretations. Their frequent blinking might be seen as a sign of nervousness or discomfort, which often accompanies deceit. It’s notable that their gaze shifts quite a bit — sometimes directed towards the interlocutor, at other times downwards or sideways. Such gaze aversion can indicate an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, possibly because they are fabricating information or feeling uneasy about what they’re saying. 

On the other hand, the fact that they do maintain eye contact at times complicates the picture. Sustained gaze could be a method to appear convincing and honest, a conscious effort to counterbalance any suspicion their behavior might arouse. The subtle nods and occasional head tilting might also be attempts to signal agreement or openness, potentially to build trust with the listener. Shrugs could imply uncertainty or an attempt to downplay the importance of what they’re discussing, which might be a tactic to avoid giving a direct answer.

Putting all these observations together, it seems more likely than not that the person is lying. The mixture of signals—shifting gaze, nervous blinking, and somewhat contradictory gestures—doesn’t align well with a straightforward, truthful account. While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove deceit, the overall pattern suggests an underlying discomfort consistent with dishonesty. That said, it’s important to acknowledge that stress or anxiety unrelated to deception might also produce similar behaviors, so the conclusion remains an informed inference rather than absolute certainty.

Observing the person's behavior throughout the video, several subtle nonverbal cues stand out that might initially lead to some ambiguity regarding their truthfulness. The individual smiles occasionally, which in some contexts can be a sign of confidence or ease, but it could also be a social mask to conceal deceit. The raising of eyebrows might suggest surprise or disbelief, yet it can also be an involuntary reaction to the topic at hand rather than an attempt at deception.

The person's gaze is primarily directed towards their interlocutor, which typically aligns with openness and honesty, as liars often avoid eye contact. However, there are moments when the gaze shifts upward, a gesture sometimes associated with constructing or recalling information, raising a slight possibility that the person might be fabricating details. Additionally, the head tilting could indicate engagement and thoughtfulness, which would support sincerity, but it might also be a nervous gesture.

Balancing these observations, the preponderance of behaviors like the occasional smiles and the upward glance seem to lean more towards the person potentially concealing something, which introduces uncertainty about their truthfulness. While the steady gaze towards the interlocutor and natural head tilting might suggest genuineness, these can also be employed strategically to mask deceit. Taking all these factors into account, it seems more likely that the person is not telling the whole truth, though one must remain cautiously open to other interpretations in a different context.

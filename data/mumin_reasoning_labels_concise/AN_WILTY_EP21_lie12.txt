Watching this video, I noticed a few behaviors that caught my attention. The person maintains gaze toward the interlocutor, which could suggest engagement and honesty, as people tend to look at the person they are speaking to when they want to be convincing. However, the gaze shifting upwards is often associated with someone trying to access memories or construct a story, which might hint at fabrication rather than recalling a truthful event. Additionally, the head shaking is intriguing—it could indicate disagreement or discomfort, perhaps an unconscious sign of internal conflict or doubt about what is being said.

Considering these behaviors together, it seems plausible that the person is not telling the truth. The steady gaze could be an attempt to appear sincere, while the upward gaze and head shaking might betray underlying deception or uncertainty. Of course, none of these cues alone guarantees lying, as they can vary greatly among individuals and contexts. Still, in this case, the combination of a potentially rehearsed gaze and subtle signs of discomfort leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely lying.

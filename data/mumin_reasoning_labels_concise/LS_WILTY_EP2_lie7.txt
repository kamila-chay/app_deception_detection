Watching the video closely, there are several behavioral cues that suggest the person might not be fully truthful. For instance, the combination of a smile paired with raised eyebrows and the lip corners turning upward could initially signal friendliness or openness, but in this context, it might also be an attempt to mask discomfort or create a false sense of confidence. The upward movement of the chin and the gaze directed at the interlocutor might imply assertiveness, yet when you see the gaze occasionally shift downward or sideways, it often reflects internal conflict or hesitation, which can sometimes be linked to deceit.

Furthermore, the subtle tilting and turning of the head, along with shaking, could indicate uncertainty or an effort to deflect. The openness of the arms may seem to show vulnerability or honesty, but given the other mixed signals, it could be a rehearsed posture to appear more credible. While none of these behaviors conclusively prove lying on their own—since people exhibit a wide range of nonverbal cues for many reasons—the overall pattern here leans toward the person potentially being deceptive. Their actions suggest a conscious effort to cover up something, rather than straightforward communication, which supports the assessment that they are likely not telling the truth.

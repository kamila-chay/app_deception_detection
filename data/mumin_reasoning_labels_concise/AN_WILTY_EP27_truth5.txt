Observing this individual's behavior, particularly their gaze direction, offers some insight into their state of mind and honesty. Notably, the person looks upward during their communication. Some theories in psychology suggest that looking up can be associated with accessing visual memories or constructing images, which might indicate fabrication in certain contexts. However, this interpretation is not definitive—people often look up naturally when thinking or recalling information without intending to deceive.

Given that we know the person is telling the truth, it makes sense to consider that their upward gaze here is likely tied to recalling accurate memories rather than fabricating them. The absence of other notable suspicious behaviors strengthens this likelihood, suggesting that their nonverbal cues align with genuine reflection rather than deception. While it’s tempting to view upward glances skeptically in isolation, considering the full context and recognizing individual differences in behavior leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is being truthful in this case.

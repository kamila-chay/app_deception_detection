Watching the video, the person's behavior caught my attention in several subtle ways that might suggest they were not being entirely truthful. Their facial expression, marked by a noticeable scowl, could indicate discomfort or frustration—emotions often linked to someone struggling to maintain a lie. The upward movement of their chin might signal an attempt to project confidence or assertiveness, which can sometimes be a defensive posture when someone is not being honest. I also noticed their gaze frequently shifting upward, which some theories suggest might reflect cognitive effort to construct a deceptive narrative. At the same time, their gaze returned repeatedly to the interlocutor, possibly scanning for reactions or trying to gauge whether their story is being believed. Finally, the head shaking could be emblematic of internal conflict or an unconscious expression of denial.

That said, I must acknowledge these behaviors are not definitive proof on their own. A scowl might simply indicate displeasure unrelated to deception, and looking away or shaking the head could also be gestures of doubt or confusion rather than deliberate lying. Still, taken together, these cues seem to form a pattern more consistent with someone fabricating or withholding the truth rather than speaking candidly. While I can’t be absolutely certain without additional context, my educated guess leans toward the person lying in this instance.

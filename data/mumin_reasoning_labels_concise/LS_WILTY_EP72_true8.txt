Watching the video, I noticed a number of subtle behaviors that suggest the person is likely being truthful, though it's important to consider both sides carefully. The individual frequently raises their eyebrows, which can often signal openness or surprise—expressions people tend to show more when they're honest rather than deceptive. Their gaze is primarily directed towards the interlocutor, which typically indicates engagement and a willingness to connect, something that might be less common if someone were trying to conceal the truth.

At times, their gaze shifts downward, which could raise some questions since avoiding eye contact might hint at discomfort or evasion. However, in the context of this video, the downward glance seems more reflective, as if the person is thoughtfully recalling information rather than deliberately hiding it. Additionally, the use of open-handed gestures, particularly with palms facing up, suggests sincerity and transparency. This kind of nonverbal cue often accompanies truthful statements and a genuine effort to communicate clearly.

While none of these behaviors alone can guarantee honesty, taken together they create a consistent pattern that leans toward the person telling the truth. Of course, everyone can exhibit these same behaviors in different contexts, and some individuals might be skilled at masking deception. Still, based on what I've observed here, my best estimation is that the person is likely being truthful.

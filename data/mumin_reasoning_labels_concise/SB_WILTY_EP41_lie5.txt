Watching the video closely, there are several subtle behavioral cues that suggest the person might not be entirely truthful. For instance, the combination of raising eyebrows and alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and then glancing sideways could signal discomfort or an attempt to gauge the listener's reaction, which sometimes accompanies deception. The movements of the chin, fluctuating between upward and downward motions, alongside shifts in head position—both tilting and side-turning—may indicate internal conflict or an effort to regulate emotional expression.

On the other hand, these behaviors could also be interpreted as natural responses to stress or nervousness, rather than clear signs of lying. Sometimes, heightened attention or confusion can prompt similar gestures without any intent to deceive. However, when these signals appear together repeatedly, especially combined with subtle forward and backward head motions, it strengthens the suspicion that the person might be manipulating the truth.

While no single behavior conclusively proves deception, the pattern and combination of these actions more likely point to the person not being completely honest in their communication. Therefore, considering the context and the behaviors exhibited, it seems reasonable to estimate that the person is lying, though it remains an educated guess rather than a certainty.

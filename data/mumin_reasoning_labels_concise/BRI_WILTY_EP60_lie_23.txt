Upon observing the individual's behavior in the video, there are subtle cues that might suggest some degree of deception. For example, the person’s gaze occasionally shifts upward, which in some contexts can be associated with cognitive effort or fabricating information. This upward gaze might reflect an attempt to construct or recall details rather than simply recount a straightforward truth. 

However, it's important to consider alternative explanations. Looking upwards can also indicate someone is thinking or reflecting genuinely, rather than trying to mislead. People often look up when searching their memory or processing complex thoughts, which doesn’t necessarily mean dishonesty. Moreover, without further corroborating signs such as inconsistencies in speech, nervous gestures, or changes in tone, it’s challenging to conclusively identify lying based solely on this behavior.

That said, given the subtle but notable upward gaze coupled with a somewhat rehearsed or unnatural manner, it seems more likely than not that the person isn’t being entirely truthful. While this isn’t definitive proof, the behavioral cues align with patterns commonly observed during deception, making it a reasonable inference that the individual could be lying.

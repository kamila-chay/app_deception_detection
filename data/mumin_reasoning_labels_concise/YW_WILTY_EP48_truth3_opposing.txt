Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting signals that could be interpreted in different ways. For instance, the frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or concern, which could sometimes be associated with discomfort or even deceit. However, eyebrow movements like raising can also indicate surprise or emphasis, which are not necessarily signs of dishonesty.

Their gaze toward the interlocutor suggests engagement, which tends to align more with truthful communication—people lying often avoid direct eye contact, though that's not a hard rule. The head shaking is a bit more ambiguous; it can express disagreement or denial, but it might also be a natural gesture emphasizing honesty or reinforcing a point.

Considering all these behaviors together, it seems more plausible that the person is not telling the truth. The engaged gaze and the combination of expressive eyebrows could be signs used to mask evasiveness rather than indicate openness. While some gestures might appear sincere if taken alone, in this context they feel consistent with someone attempting to appear honest. Of course, without additional context or knowing their baseline behavior, there's always some uncertainty, but overall, the evidence leans toward deception.

Watching the video carefully, the person’s behavior appears to suggest a level of discomfort and guardedness that might indicate deception. Their smile seems less genuine, as the upward movement of the lip corners could be interpreted as a forced expression rather than a spontaneously positive emotion. Additionally, the slight upward movement of the chin may be a subtle indicator of defensiveness or insincerity, suggesting that they may not feel entirely at ease with the information they are sharing. The person’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor, while seeming engaged, might also be an attempt to mask dishonesty or manipulate perception, which can align with deceptive communication.

That said, I recognize that none of these behaviors on their own can definitively prove deception. For example, people who are truthful can also smile or maintain eye contact in a convincing manner. Conversely, nervous or anxious individuals might exhibit discomfort or less confident postures even when telling the truth. Despite these possible alternative explanations, taken together, the combination of a less natural smile, guarded posture, and the nature of the gaze leans more toward a deceptive presentation. Therefore, my assessment, with some caution, is that the person is likely lying.

Watching the video, I noticed the person often looked downward while speaking. At first glance, this behavior might raise some suspicion, as avoiding direct eye contact is sometimes associated with dishonesty or discomfort. However, it is important to consider alternative explanations. Looking down can also indicate thoughtfulness, concentration, or even a way to manage nervousness without any intent to deceive. 

Given these possibilities, while the downward gaze could superficially suggest evasiveness, it doesn’t necessarily mean the person is lying. In fact, their overall demeanor didn’t display other typical signs of deceit, such as inconsistent facial expressions or overly defensive body language. Taking everything into account, it seems more plausible that the downward gaze here is a natural gesture linked to the person’s way of processing or recalling information, rather than an attempt to hide the truth. Thus, the reasonable conclusion—though arrived at with some caution—is that the person is likely being truthful.

Watching the person's behavior carefully, several subtle cues catch my attention that might suggest they are not being entirely truthful. The raised eyebrows and noticeably wide eyes come off as somewhat exaggerated, almost as if they are trying too hard to convey surprise or sincerity. This kind of overemphasis can sometimes indicate that someone is attempting to convince the viewer of their honesty, even if their words might not align with reality.

On the other hand, their gaze remains steady and directed towards the interlocutor, which is often interpreted as a sign of openness and honesty. Typically, individuals who are lying might avoid eye contact or look away more frequently. Yet, this steady gaze combined with the exaggerated eye movements feels slightly incongruent — as though they are consciously maintaining eye contact to mask any deceptive intent.

Given these observations, it seems plausible that the person is indeed fabricating or embellishing their story, using exaggerated facial expressions and sustained eye contact as tools to appear more credible. Admittedly, none of these behaviors alone can definitively prove deceit, since some people naturally express themselves in this way or might be responding to stress or nervousness unrelated to dishonesty. However, considering the combination of these signs, my educated guess leans toward the individual lying in this moment.

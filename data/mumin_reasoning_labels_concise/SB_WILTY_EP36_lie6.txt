Watching the video, the person's behavior presents a mix of signals that could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, the combination of a smile alongside scowling and frowning eyebrows seems somewhat contradictory, which might indicate internal conflict or discomfort. Raising eyebrows can sometimes denote surprise or uncertainty, while lip corners turning up might suggest an attempt to appear agreeable or disarming. The fact that the individual maintains gaze toward the interlocutor suggests they are trying to engage or convince, which is common in both truthful and deceptive interactions.

However, other subtle cues such as head shaking and the repeated touching or rubbing of hands and other parts of the body often signal nervousness or self-soothing—behaviors frequently associated with deception. Open arms could be a gesture intended to seem transparent or inviting, but in this context, it may be performing double duty, attempting to distract from underlying tension.

Taking these observations into account, it seems plausible that the person is not being entirely forthcoming. The contradictory facial expressions combined with the nervous gestures strongly hint at some level of discomfort with the truth. While none of these signals alone confirm deception, together they form a pattern that leans toward the person lying. Of course, it's always possible these behaviors stem from other sources such as stress or fatigue, but given the overall picture, deception is a reasonable conclusion.

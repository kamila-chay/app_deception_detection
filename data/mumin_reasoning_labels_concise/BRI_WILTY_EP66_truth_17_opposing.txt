Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues that invite close consideration. They raise their eyebrows at moments, which can often be interpreted as a sign of surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating engagement with the subject matter. Their gaze shifts back and forth—sometimes directly toward the interlocutor, which suggests openness and willingness to communicate truthfully, but at other times the gaze moves sideways. This sideways look might raise some initial suspicion, as it can sometimes be associated with evasion or discomfort.

However, taking these behaviors together, especially the occasional sideways gaze, leans more toward deceit than honesty. People who are truthful tend to maintain more consistent eye contact and exhibit fewer signs of nervousness, whereas this person’s shifting gaze could reflect evasion or discomfort rather than mere thoughtfulness or momentary distraction. While the direct gaze might suggest engagement, it alone is not a definitive indicator of truthfulness.

Thus, considering the context and the overall behavioral pattern, the evidence tips toward the person being untruthful. Of course, none of these nonverbal signals can guarantee deception with certainty, as individual quirks in behavior vary widely, but on balance, this person exhibits signs more commonly associated with lying.

Watching the video closely, the person's behavior presents some interesting signs that might indicate deception, though it’s not entirely straightforward. The downward movement of the chin often suggests a defensive or uncertain posture, which could align with someone trying to withhold or distort information. The gaze directed towards the interlocutor seems genuine at first, as it typically suggests engagement, yet in the context of potential lying, it can sometimes be a conscious attempt to appear truthful and maintain control over the interaction.

The head tilting, combined with hands touching the head or body, might point to subtle discomfort or self-soothing gestures, both of which can be indicative of stress associated with lying. On the other hand, the arms being open could suggest a level of openness or sincerity—almost contradicting the other more guarded behaviors. However, it’s possible the individual is trying to balance their discomfort with an outward appearance of honesty.

Taken altogether, while some behaviors can be interpreted in different ways, the cluster of cues—particularly those related to self-touching and downward chin movement—leans more towards the person feeling uneasy or concealed about what they are saying. This uneasiness could very well be stemming from deceit. So, while it’s important to consider that none of these signals are definitive on their own, the overall pattern here reasonably supports the idea that the person is likely not being truthful.

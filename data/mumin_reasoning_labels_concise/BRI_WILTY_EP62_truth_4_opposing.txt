Watching the video closely, the person maintains consistent eye contact with the interlocutor throughout their speech. This behavior often suggests engagement and confidence, which can be indicators of honesty. On the other hand, it’s worth noting that someone who is skilled at deception might also maintain steady eye contact to mask their intent, so this alone isn’t definitive proof.

However, given the fluidity of their gaze and the naturalness of their expressions, it leans more toward authenticity rather than rehearsed or forced behavior. If the person were dishonest, one might expect subtle signs of discomfort or avoidance of the interlocutor’s eyes, yet those are notably absent here. While no single behavioral cue can guarantee truthfulness, the steadiness of their gaze does provide a reasonable basis to conclude that they are being truthful.

Watching the video closely, I noticed a few behaviors that caught my attention. The person often raises their eyebrows and blinks quite frequently, which can sometimes suggest a heightened emotional state or discomfort. Their gaze shifts repeatedly, sometimes directed towards the interlocutor, but also looking down at times. The head tilting further adds to the complexity of their nonverbal cues.

Considering these behaviors, it seems plausible that the person might be trying to mask some underlying tension or unease. The frequent blinking and eyebrow raising could indicate that they're processing information quickly or feeling stressed, while the gaze shifts could suggest a conflict between wanting to engage and wanting to avoid scrutiny. However, one could argue that someone might naturally exhibit these behaviors out of habit or nervousness unrelated to deceit.

Despite this, the combination and context of these actions lean towards the interpretation that the person is not being entirely truthful. Their discomfort seems more than just casual anxiety, suggesting they could be withholding information or fabricating parts of their story. While it's difficult to be certain without further context, the clues strongly hint at deception rather than straightforward honesty.

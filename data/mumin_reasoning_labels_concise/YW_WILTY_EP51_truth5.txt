Watching the video, the individual maintains a steady gaze toward their interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and openness. Their head tilts slightly at moments, a subtle nonverbal cue that can indicate thoughtfulness or curiosity rather than deception. Additionally, the person’s palms are visible and oriented upwards, a gesture commonly associated with honesty and receptiveness. 

On the other hand, one could argue that steady eye contact and head tilting might also be consciously employed to appear sincere, potentially masking dishonest intent. However, these behaviors, taken together with the open palm gesture, create a pattern that generally aligns more with truthful communication than with deceit. While it’s impossible to be absolutely certain without further context, the combination of these nonverbal signals leans toward the conclusion that the person is likely telling the truth.

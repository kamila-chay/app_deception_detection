Watching the video, the person's behavior caught my attention, especially their eye movements. At several points, I noticed them looking upward and occasionally shifting their gaze sideways. These subtle nonverbal cues can sometimes be associated with cognitive processes related to fabricating or manipulating information, which might suggest they are not fully truthful. However, it's important to consider that such eye movements can also reflect thinking or trying to recall uncertain details, not necessarily deception.

On the other hand, the lack of more overt signs of discomfort or nervousness makes it easier to be confident in their honesty. They don’t exhibit any obvious signs of stress that one might expect if someone were consciously trying to hide the truth. Still, given the context and these particular gaze patterns, it leans more toward the likelihood that they were being truthful in their statements. While it’s impossible to be definitive without more context, the eye behavior subtly points toward honesty as a plausible explanation.

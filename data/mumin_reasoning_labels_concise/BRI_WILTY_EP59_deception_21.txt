Watching the video, the person’s behavior raises some interesting questions. Their frequent blinking could suggest they’re feeling a bit uneasy or pressured, which sometimes aligns with someone trying to conceal the truth. The shifts in gaze, especially when they look down or sideways, might indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct engagement, which people often do when they're not being fully forthcoming. However, one could argue that looking towards the interlocutor shows they are still trying to engage and not completely withdraw, which might suggest honesty or at least a desire to appear sincere.

Yet, considering the combination of these subtle cues—especially the inconsistent gaze patterns combined with the blinking—it feels like the person is struggling internally, which often accompanies deception. While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove lying, together they paint a picture that leans toward the person not being entirely truthful. So, while it’s not an absolute certainty, the evidence here reasonably supports the conclusion that the individual is likely lying.

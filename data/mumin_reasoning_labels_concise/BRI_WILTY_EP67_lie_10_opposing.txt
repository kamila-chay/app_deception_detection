Watching the video carefully, several behaviors caught my attention that might suggest the person is being entirely truthful. Notably, their gaze often shifts sideways rather than maintaining steady eye contact, which can sometimes indicate a degree of discomfort or an effort to avoid direct scrutiny. Additionally, I observed the person using a "palms up" gesture, which is often interpreted as a subconscious attempt to appear open or sincere, though in some contexts it might be a subtle way to deflect or soften a statement that isn’t completely honest.

That said, it’s important to recognize that such behaviors aren’t definitive proof against honesty on their own. People might avert their gaze simply out of nervousness or shyness, and palms-up gestures might be natural or culturally influenced expressions rather than deliberate signals. Furthermore, honesty is a complex psychological state, and body language cues can vary widely from person to person.

However, considering these behaviors together—the sideways gaze paired with a somewhat pleading or “open” hand posture—there seems to be a pattern consistent with someone trying to persuade or convince while feeling uneasy. This combination supports a reasonable belief and, based on these observations, I lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely being truthful, albeit with a healthy awareness that nonverbal signals alone cannot conclusively determine honesty.

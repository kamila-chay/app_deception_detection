Observing the person in the video, it appears they maintain a steady gaze toward their interlocutor for much of the interaction. This kind of eye contact often suggests engagement and attentiveness, which can be indicative of sincerity. At the same time, there are moments when their gaze shifts upwards, which some might interpret as a sign of evasion or fabrication. However, gaze aversion or upward glances can also occur naturally as someone recalls information or processes their thoughts, rather than as a deliberate attempt to deceive.

Balancing these cues, the consistency of their focus on the interlocutor combined with the natural pauses for mental retrieval evident in the upward gaze leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is being truthful. While it's true that deceptive individuals sometimes avoid eye contact or display irregular gaze patterns, the behavior here seems more aligned with thoughtful communication rather than calculated deception. That said, no single behavioral cue can guarantee honesty, but given the overall impression, it seems reasonable to infer that this person is indeed telling the truth.

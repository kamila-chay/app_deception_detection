Watching the video closely, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues to analyze. At one point, their gaze shifts sideways rather than maintaining steady eye contact. This kind of behavior can sometimes raise suspicion, as it’s often suggested that avoiding direct eye contact might indicate discomfort or an attempt to hide something. However, it's important to consider that not all gaze aversions signify deceit; they can also be a natural response to processing information or feeling slightly self-conscious, especially if someone is under scrutiny or nervous.

Given the overall demeanor and the context, the sideways glance appears to be deliberate and somewhat evasive. There is an exaggerated pattern of looking away along with other subtle signs that can accompany deceptive behavior, such as inconsistent facial expressions or nervous movements. Instead, it feels less like a moment of thoughtfulness or contemplation. This subtlety suggests that the person might be fabricating details or formulating their responses rather than genuinely recalling them.

While it’s impossible to be 100% certain based on gaze alone, weighing the behavior alongside the presence of these deception indicators supports the idea that the person is not telling the truth. The sideways gaze seems more like a calculated attempt to mislead than a natural, albeit slightly cautious, reaction. Therefore, although a sideways glance might initially suggest innocence, the overall impression leans towards dishonesty in this case.

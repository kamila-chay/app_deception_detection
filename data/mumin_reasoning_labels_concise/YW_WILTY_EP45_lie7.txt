Watching the video, the person exhibits a mix of subtle but telling behaviors that suggest they might not be completely truthful. Their eyebrows alternately frown and raise, which can indicate internal conflict or attempts to gauge the listener's reaction—sometimes a sign of discomfort or uncertainty. At the same time, their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which might be interpreted as an effort to maintain control over the situation or to convince the listener. The nodding could be seen as a way to encourage agreement or to signal cooperation, yet it might also mask underlying hesitation. Folding the arms is often a defensive posture, possibly signaling self-protection or resistance, even if the person wants to appear open. 

On the other hand, none of these behaviors alone definitively prove deception, as people naturally exhibit such cues for a range of reasons, including stress, concentration, or social norms. The person’s direct gaze and nodding could simply indicate engagement and a desire to communicate clearly. However, taken together—the fluctuating eyebrow movements paired with the defensive arm crossing and steady gaze—these signs lean toward the possibility that the person is withholding the full truth or is uncomfortable with what they are saying. While it's hard to be certain without further context, the combination of these behaviors makes it reasonable to suspect that the person is not being entirely honest.

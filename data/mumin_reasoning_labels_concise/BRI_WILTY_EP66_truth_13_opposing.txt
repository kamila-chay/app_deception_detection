Watching the video, the person’s demeanor strikes me as generally closed and insincere, which leans toward the likelihood that they are lying. The smile appears forced rather than natural, suggesting discomfort or negativity in what they are communicating. Additionally, the raising of eyebrows could indicate tension or a calculated emphasis on certain points, which often accompanies dishonest expression.

That said, the gaze sideways introduces a layer of complexity. Typically, avoiding direct eye contact might raise suspicion, as it can sometimes be interpreted as evasiveness or discomfort. However, there are also many instances where people glance sideways simply out of habit or to recall information, which doesn't necessarily imply deceit. Given the context here and the other behaviors, it feels more like a conscious gesture rather than an attempt to be honest.

Balancing these observations, while some signals could be interpreted as truthful, the overall impression is that the person is being deceptive. Their emotional expressions and engagement seem consistent with someone fabricating a story rather than sharing authentic information. Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that nonverbal cues are not foolproof indicators on their own, but in this case, they support the conclusion that the person is lying.

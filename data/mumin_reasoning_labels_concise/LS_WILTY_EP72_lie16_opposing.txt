Watching the video closely, there are a few subtle behavioral cues that stand out, which might suggest the person is being entirely truthful. Their gaze shifts toward the interlocutor at times, which often indicates engagement, and then occasionally drifts upward—a gesture some studies link to cognitive effort, as if they are trying to carefully construct or recall information rather than recount it naturally. This upward glance could reflect the mental load involved in genuine reflection or thoughtful recollection. Additionally, the presence of shrugging adds a layer of ambiguity; it might be interpreted as a nonverbal way of expressing uncertainty or defensiveness, possibly an honest attempt to acknowledge limits in memory or avoid providing an inaccurate answer.

That said, none of these signals alone definitively confirm honesty. People can look upward when they genuinely think or reflect, and shrugging is a common and often innocuous gesture. Their gaze toward the interlocutor could be a sign of honesty and openness rather than concealment. However, when considering these behaviors collectively—the upward gaze suggesting cognitive effort combined with a shrug that might signify openness or cautiousness—it leans toward the interpretation that the individual is being forthcoming. While this assessment isn't absolute, the interplay of these subtle cues gives a reasoned basis to believe that the person is telling the truth.

Watching the video, the person's behavior raises some interesting points that suggest they are likely telling the full truth. For one, the combination of raising eyebrows and a downward movement of the chin could indicate a nuanced emotional response—maybe uncertainty or an attempt to manage how much they reveal. The way they maintain their gaze towards the interlocutor might initially seem like a sign of honesty, since avoiding eye contact often raises suspicion. However, some people who lie are quite adept at maintaining steady eye contact to appear credible. The subtle nods and head turns hint at a kind of self-soothing or defensive stance, as if they’re trying to justify or reinforce their statements internally.

That said, these behaviors alone don’t guarantee deceit; some could be attributed to nervousness or the natural dynamics of conversation. But when interpreting these cues together, especially the interplay of facial movements and gestures, it’s reasonable to conclude that the person is being open and truthful. While it’s hard to be certain without more context, the signs lean towards the conclusion that the individual is likely being entirely truthful.

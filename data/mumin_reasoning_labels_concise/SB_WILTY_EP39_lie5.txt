Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents a mix of cues that could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, the smile and lip corners turning up might suggest a degree of confidence or comfort, often associated with honesty or ease in conversation. The gaze directed towards the interlocutor also typically signals engagement and sincerity, as avoiding eye contact can sometimes indicate deception. Additionally, the head tilting and side-turning can be seen as signs of openness or thoughtfulness.

However, when considering the subtle shifts of the chin moving both upwards and downwards, those movements may suggest some internal conflict or unease. Such small, repeated motions could indicate uncertainty or the effort to control one’s expressions. The gaze shifting down at times, despite the overall engagement, might reveal moments of hesitation or discomfort, which can sometimes accompany dishonest behavior. The palms up gesture can be interpreted as an attempt to appear open and truthful, but it can also be a deliberate effort to persuade or manipulate.

Balancing these observations, it seems plausible that while the person is trying to present themselves as honest and open, underlying signs of discomfort and inconsistent nonverbal signals point towards deception. Although none of these clues are definitive on their own, taken together, they suggest that the person may not be fully truthful. Thus, the evidence leans towards the conclusion that they are likely lying, even if they are consciously or unconsciously attempting to mask it.

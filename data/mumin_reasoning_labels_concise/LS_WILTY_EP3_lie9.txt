Observing the person's behavior in the video, there are several subtle cues that suggest they may not be entirely truthful. The frequent blinking could indicate increased cognitive load or stress, which is often associated with attempting to fabricate or withhold information. Their gaze towards the interlocutor shows engagement, but the moments when they look upwards might reflect that they are searching for information or constructing responses rather than recalling straightforward facts. The nodding could be interpreted as a way to appear agreeable or to reinforce their statements, while the occasional head shaking might signal internal conflict or an unconscious expression of doubt.

Of course, none of these behaviors definitively prove deception on their own; frequent blinking could result from discomfort unrelated to lying, and gaze shifts might simply be natural conversational behavior. However, taken together, these patterns raise reasonable doubt about the person's honesty. While it's possible they are telling the truth and simply anxious or thoughtful, the combination of signs leans more convincingly toward the person being untruthful in this instance.

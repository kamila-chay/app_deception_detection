Watching the video, the person's behavior struck me as somewhat ambiguous but with hints that could suggest dishonesty. At first glance, the raised eyebrows and exaggerated opening of the mouth might indicate surprise or an attempt to appear sincere. However, these expressions felt somewhat forced, as if they were overcompensating. The slight upward turn of the lip corners could be interpreted as a polite smile or an attempt to mask discomfort, but it didn't quite reach their eyes, which often signals a genuine expression.

Their gaze is particularly telling; while they frequently looked at the interlocutor, there were moments when their eyes shifted downward. This fluctuations in gaze could imply internal conflict or an effort to avoid direct eye contact when fabricating details. The head tilting was subtle but noticeable, possibly indicating uncertainty or a mental effort to construct a believable narrative.

Of course, none of these behaviors definitively prove lying, since people can exhibit similar signs under stress or nervousness even when telling the truth. Nevertheless, considering the combination and timing of these behaviors, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person was not being entirely truthful in the video. The interplay of overdone displays of emotion, inconsistent eye contact, and subtle physical cues paints a picture that aligns with someone who is attempting to deceive.

Watching the video carefully, there are a few subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. For instance, the frequent movement of the chin—sometimes upwards, at other times downwards—could indicate a kind of conflict or hesitation internally, as if they’re trying to reconcile what they’re saying with their own doubts or uncertain feelings. The shifts in gaze are also telling; moments where the person looks down rather than maintaining steady eye contact with the interlocutor often point to discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct scrutiny.

However, some movements, like nodding and raising eyebrows, might ordinarily be read as signs of engagement or affirmation, which could argue in favor of sincerity. Yet, when these are combined with the head movements—forward, backward, and turning to the side—they may mask deeper unease or attempts to regulate the impression they’re making. The head moving backward could indicate a subtle desire to distance themselves from the statements they’re making, while side-turns might reflect a kind of guardedness.

While none of these behaviors individually guarantees deception, the overall pattern—a mixture of protective gestures and gaze avoidance—leans toward the conclusion that the person could be lying. Of course, it’s important to consider that sometimes nervousness or other emotions can produce similar behaviors. Still, given the combination and recurrence of these signs, I would reasonably estimate the person is not being completely truthful.

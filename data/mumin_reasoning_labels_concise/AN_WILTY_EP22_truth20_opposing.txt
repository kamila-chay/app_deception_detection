Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests a generally guarded and potentially deceptive demeanor, though it's important to approach this with some caution before drawing firm conclusions. Their smile appears genuine, which often aligns with positive intent, but smiles can sometimes be used to mask discomfort or uncertainty. The raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or a desire to emphasize sincerity, but they could also reflect skepticism or an attempt to engage the listener more effectively. Notably, the sideways gaze could be interpreted in a few ways—while it sometimes signals evasion, it can also be a natural reaction during thoughtful conversation, as the person processes information or recalls details. The occasional nod lends a supportive tone, reinforcing agreement or affirmation.

Taken together, these behaviors lean toward deception rather than authenticity and openness. While some cues, like the gaze, might be consistent with engagement, here they seem aligned with someone who is guarded or reflective in how they communicate. Given the overall picture, an educated guess would be that the person is lying, though as always with nonverbal cues, certainty is elusive and context-sensitive.

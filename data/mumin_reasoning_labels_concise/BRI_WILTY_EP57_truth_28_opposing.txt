Watching the video, there are several behavioral cues that initially might raise questions about the person's credibility. The frowning eyebrows and the head shaking could be interpreted as signs of discomfort or disagreement, which in some contexts might suggest evasiveness or deception. On the other hand, the raising of eyebrows often signals surprise or an attempt to emphasize a point, which could align with someone genuinely conveying information they find important or unexpected.

That said, these behaviors strongly indicate that the person is being truthful. People often frown or shake their heads when they are frustrated or trying to clarify a misunderstanding, not necessarily when they are being dishonest. The combination of these expressions might instead suggest that the person is passionate and sincere about what they are saying, perhaps even reacting to a challenging question or reflecting internal conflict rather than deceit.

Given these observations, while the presence of such expressions might raise a small degree of suspicion in a different scenario, it’s reasonable to confidently conclude that this person is telling the truth. Their behavioral signals seem more consistent with someone who is earnest and engaged rather than someone who is deliberately misleading. Of course, without hearing the content or having additional context, this remains an educated approximation rather than an absolute judgment.

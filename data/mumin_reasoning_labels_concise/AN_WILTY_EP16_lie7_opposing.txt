Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues that suggest they might be fully truthful. Their lip corners are turned down, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or sadness—both of which might arise if someone is emotionally affected by what they’re sharing. At the same time, their gaze remains directed toward the interlocutor, which could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might be an attempt to appear confident and sincere, aiming to convince the listener. On the other hand, some people might overcompensate by locking eyes when they’re not telling the truth, striving to make their deception less noticeable.

While strong eye contact often correlates with honesty, it’s important to remember that there’s no single nonverbal behavior that definitively signals lying. The downturned lip corners might suggest unease, which could be a subtle giveaway, but it’s also possible the person feels genuinely upset or is simply tired. Still, when combining the subtle tension in their facial expression with the purposeful gaze, I lean toward the idea that the person is being truthful. It's not an absolute conclusion, but these behavioral cues together paint a picture consistent with sincere behavior.

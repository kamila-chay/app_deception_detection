Watching the video, the person's behavior is quite intriguing and somewhat conflicting, which makes it difficult to be entirely certain about their truthfulness. On one hand, their smile and raised eyebrows could be interpreted as signs of openness or engagement, perhaps suggesting sincerity. The gaze directed toward the interlocutor often indicates attentiveness and honesty, as people tend to look others in the eye when they’re being truthful. 

However, some of the other cues raise questions. The exaggerated mouth opening combined with the chin moving upwards could signal a level of discomfort or an attempt to appear more convincing than they actually feel. Moreover, the moments when the gaze shifts downward and the head turns to the side might be subtle signs of evasiveness or an unconscious effort to avoid full engagement, which can be associated with deception.

Balancing these observations, while some behaviors might initially seem inconsistent, the combination of gestures can also be seen as genuine expressions of the person's internal state rather than a deliberate performance. The mixed signals make it easy to understand why one might initially doubt them, but looking deeper, the overall behavior leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is being truthful. That said, it’s important to acknowledge the complexity of nonverbal communication and that none of these behaviors alone definitively prove deceit.

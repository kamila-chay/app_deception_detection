Watching the video, the person appears to maintain consistent eye contact with the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and sincerity. Their arms remain open, a posture that can indicate openness and a lack of defensiveness. These nonverbal cues typically align with someone who is being deceptive, as they can convey a rehearsed transparency and confidence meant to mislead.

That said, it’s important to consider that such behaviors can sometimes occur naturally even when someone is being untruthful, so they are not foolproof indicators on their own. For instance, maintaining gaze and open body language could be strategic or rehearsed. However, in this case, the naturalness of the gestures and the overall demeanor may mask underlying discomfort or deception. On balance, given the observed body language and the context, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is lying. While absolute certainty is difficult without additional cues or information, the behavioral signs here reasonably support that assessment.

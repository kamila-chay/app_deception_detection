Watching the video, the person maintains consistent eye contact with the other individual, which generally suggests engagement and openness. Typically, people who are being deceptive might avoid direct gaze or exhibit nervous glances away from their interlocutor, but here the gaze appears steady and natural. That said, it’s worth considering that some skilled deceivers can also master eye contact to appear truthful, so relying solely on this behavior wouldn’t be foolproof.

On balance, the straightforward and continuous gaze towards the interlocutor leans more towards sincerity rather than deceit. While it’s possible that the person could be controlling their eye movements deliberately, there are no obvious signs of discomfort or evasiveness in their expression or posture that might hint at dishonesty. Given these observations, and keeping in mind the limitations of interpreting behavior in isolation, I’d reasonably conclude that the person is telling the truth.

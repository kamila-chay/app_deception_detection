Observing the individual's behavior, several subtle cues warrant consideration when assessing their truthfulness. The downward pull at the corners of the lips could suggest some level of discomfort or sadness, but it doesn't necessarily indicate honesty—it might reflect concern or the seriousness of the topic discussed. Notably, the lips are both protruded and retracted at different moments, which might reveal moments of hesitation or thoughtfulness rather than straightforwardness.

Their gaze frequently shifts downwards and sideways, behaviors often interpreted as signs of recall or nervousness. However, these gaze patterns can also occur naturally when a person is evading information or trying to fabricate their thoughts carefully, especially if the subject matter is sensitive or complex. The openness of the arms, meanwhile, generally signals a degree of guardedness or concealment rather than transparency, which could support the notion of deceit.

While some of these behaviors might raise initial questions about possible openness or receptiveness, considering the context, it seems more plausible that the person is being deceptive but somewhat uneasy or reflective. The combination of non-defensive body language with gaze aversion that aligns more with avoidance than outright contemplation suggests dishonesty. Although it's difficult to be definitive without further context, the behavioral evidence leans toward the individual lying rather than telling the truth.

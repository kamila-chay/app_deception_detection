Watching the video, the person's behavior gives some interesting signals. The noticeable raising of the eyebrows coupled with the chin moving upwards could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, raising eyebrows can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to appear more open and honest, which might suggest sincerity. Similarly, lifting the chin might be a gesture to convey confidence or assertiveness, which could support a truthful presentation.

However, when considering these gestures altogether, especially in the context of someone potentially being untruthful, these movements might instead be compensatory behaviors. The raised eyebrows could be an attempt to overemphasize honesty or openness, almost as if trying a bit too hard to convince the viewer. Meanwhile, the upward chin movement may reflect defensiveness or a subconscious effort to project certainty despite underlying deception.

Given the subtle tension in these nonverbal cues and the incongruence between the gestures and the person's overall demeanor, it seems plausible that the person might be masking the truth. While these behaviors could be benign or even indicators of truthfulness in another context, here they lean toward a performance intended to persuade or mislead. Thus, after weighing the possibilities, it appears more likely that the person is not being entirely truthful.

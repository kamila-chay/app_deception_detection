Watching the video, the person exhibits a mix of expressions and gestures that at first glance could be somewhat contradictory. There’s a scowl paired with frowning eyebrows, which typically might suggest discomfort or displeasure, potentially signaling honesty or genuine concern. Yet, this is complicated by the subtle upward curl at the corners of the lips, which often indicates a degree of genuine engagement or even slight amusement. Their gaze is primarily directed toward the interlocutor, suggesting openness and attentiveness, but occasional sideways glances might hint at some hesitation or internal conflict.

Additionally, the head shaking and palms-up gestures are interesting; while head shaking could be interpreted as disagreement or denial, it could also be an emphatic way of reinforcing honesty—from someone trying to dismiss doubt or suspicion. Palms up is generally a sign of openness or an appeal for understanding, not something typically associated with deception.

Taking everything into account, although some behaviors could be misconstrued as signs of falsehood, the overall combination seems more consistent with someone who is genuinely telling the truth but perhaps feeling defensive or stressed about being doubted. Therefore, while it’s possible to question certain nonverbal cues here, the balance of evidence leans strongly toward sincerity, making it reasonable to conclude that the person, in this case, is indeed being truthful.

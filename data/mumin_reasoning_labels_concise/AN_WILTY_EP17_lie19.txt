In observing the individual's behavior during the interaction, several subtle yet telling cues stand out that suggest a likelihood of deception, though it’s important to remain cautious before drawing firm conclusions. The person’s lips were notably protruded, which can sometimes be an unconscious attempt to suppress the truth or mask discomfort. Additionally, the chin moving upwards combined with a head moving slightly backward may signal defensiveness or a desire to create distance from the situation—a common subconscious response when someone feels uneasy or is not being fully transparent.

Interestingly, despite these signs, the person maintained direct gaze towards the interlocutor, which might at first glance indicate honesty, as people often find it hard to lie while holding eye contact. However, this can also be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate and project sincerity, thereby masking deceit. The head side-turn and open arm gestures, such as palms up, suggest a level of openness and vulnerability, yet these can sometimes be employed as misleading tactics to appear more trustworthy.

Balancing these observations, the array of behaviors seems somewhat conflicted: elements that might indicate truthfulness are likely being used strategically to cover up less genuine signals. Given these contradictory cues and the subtle defensive body language, the weight of evidence leans toward the person not being entirely honest in this context. While it is conceivable they could be telling the truth and simply exhibiting nervousness or discomfort, the combination and interplay of these specific behaviors incline me to believe that deception is the more plausible explanation here.

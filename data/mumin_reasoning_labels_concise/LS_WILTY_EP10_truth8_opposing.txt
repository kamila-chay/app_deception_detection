Watching the video, several behavioral cues stand out that make this assessment a bit nuanced. The individual displays a mix of facial expressions that could, at face value, suggest some discomfort or uncertainty—frowning eyebrows paired with frequent blinking might be indicative of stress or internal conflict. Additionally, the lips appear protruded with the corners turned downward, which can sometimes be read as signs of dissatisfaction or reluctance. The person also shakes their head, a movement that occasionally signals disagreement or denial.

However, these signals aren’t necessarily straightforward indicators of truthfulness. The raised eyebrows and consistent gaze towards the interlocutor could imply an attempt to appear open and maintain connection, which at times may correlate with deception rather than honesty. It's possible that the person is experiencing the natural tension that comes with fabricating a story, especially if the subject matter is sensitive or emotional. Such physical manifestations can easily be misread as signs of stress without deception when, in reality, they could just be normal reactions to lying under pressure.

Considering these factors together, the behavior seems more consistent with someone who is not fully truthful but attempting to convincingly convey their thoughts despite feeling somewhat uneasy in the process. While certain cues might initially suggest honesty, the overall pattern, particularly the direct gaze combined with stress signals and the head shake, leans toward deception. Therefore, my best interpretation is that the person is indeed lying, albeit with a fair share of emotional or psychological strain accompanying their dishonesty.

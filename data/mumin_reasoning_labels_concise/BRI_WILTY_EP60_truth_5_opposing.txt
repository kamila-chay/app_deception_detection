Watching the video, the individual exhibits a few notable behaviors that caught my attention. There are moments where the person raises their eyebrows, which can sometimes indicate surprise or emphasis, but not necessarily deception. Throughout much of the interaction, the person maintains a gaze toward the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and openness. That said, there are also instances where their gaze shifts sideways and their head turns slightly to the side. While some might interpret these movements as signs of discomfort or evasion, they can also be natural reactions when recalling information or processing thoughts.

The combination of direct eye contact with occasional side glances doesn't strongly point to deception in this context, especially given the absence of more pronounced signs typically associated with lying. Of course, the subtle head turns and sideways gazes leave room for some doubt, but these could just as well represent moments of reflection rather than concealment. Taken together, the person’s demeanor appears consistent with someone telling the truth, albeit with natural, human fluctuations in their facial expressions and gaze. So, while it’s impossible to be absolutely certain without further cues, the behaviors observed lean toward honesty rather than deception.

Watching this video, the person’s behavior appears fairly consistent with someone who is being truthful, although it’s always important to consider alternative explanations. Their gaze is directed toward the interlocutor, which often indicates engagement and openness—people who lie tend to avoid direct eye contact or display frequent shifts of focus to evade scrutiny. That said, gaze behavior alone isn’t a foolproof indicator; some deceitful individuals are skilled at maintaining eye contact to appear sincere.

Another point to consider is that the person occasionally looks upward. This can sometimes be interpreted as someone accessing visual memories rather than fabricating information, which might support the idea that the person is recalling truthful details. However, it's also possible that this upward gaze is a sign of constructing a narrative, which could lean towards fabrication. The context and frequency of these glances matter, and without more information, it’s difficult to be definitive.

Taking these behaviors together, the balance of evidence gently favors the conclusion that the person is telling the truth. Maintaining gaze with the listener and the nature of upward glances suggest genuine recollection rather than deceit, but since none of these signs are definitive on their own, this remains an informed estimation rather than an absolute judgment.

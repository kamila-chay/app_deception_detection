Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests a level of engagement with the interlocutor, as indicated by their gaze directed towards them. Typically, maintaining eye contact can be interpreted as a sign of honesty and confidence, which might initially lead one to think they are being truthful. However, it’s important to consider that experienced individuals can consciously maintain eye contact to mask deceit. Given that eye contact alone isn’t a definitive indicator of truthfulness, there remains a possibility that this behavior is part of a conscious attempt to appear credible.

Balancing these observations, while the gaze towards the interlocutor might superficially imply sincerity, the broader context and subtleties in the person’s behavior could point to the opposite. Taking all this into account, it seems more likely that the individual is not being truthful, despite their apparent attentiveness and direct gaze. It’s an educated assessment grounded in the understanding that deceptive individuals can exploit behaviors typically associated with honesty to mislead others.

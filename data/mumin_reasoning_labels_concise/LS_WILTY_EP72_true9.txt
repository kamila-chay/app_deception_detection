Watching the video, the individual's behavior suggests a degree of openness and engagement that is often associated with sincerity. The person raises their eyebrows, which can be an indicator of surprise or emphasis, signaling a genuine reaction to the conversation rather than a rehearsed or rehearsing stance. Additionally, the subtle upward movement at the corners of the lips hints at a mild, perhaps reassuring smile, which tends to align more with truthful communication than with deception. Their gaze remains directed toward the interlocutor, a behavior that typically implies attentiveness and a willingness to connect, rather than avoidance, which is sometimes seen in deceptive behavior. 

Of course, it’s important to consider that these cues alone do not guarantee truthfulness, as some individuals may exhibit similar behaviors while misleading intentionally. For instance, someone skilled at deception could maintain eye contact deliberately or simulate a smile and expression of surprise. However, weighing these behaviors together—the raised eyebrows combined with a natural-looking smile and consistent gaze—leans the assessment toward a person who is likely telling the truth in this case. While no behavioral analysis can be foolproof, the signs here do not strongly support the presence of deceit and instead suggest genuine communication.

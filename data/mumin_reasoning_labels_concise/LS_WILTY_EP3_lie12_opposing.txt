Watching the video, the individual’s behavior suggests some intriguing contradictions that make me lean toward the conclusion that they are likely being truthful. For one, the person raises their eyebrows, which can sometimes be a sign of surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty. The consistent gaze toward the interlocutor also suggests engagement and a desire to maintain connection, often seen in truthful exchanges. However, these gestures aren't definitive on their own, and the subtle movements tell a more complex story.

Notably, the person's head movements seem somewhat conflicting. There is a forward motion combined with side turns, and even some head shaking, which could indicate discomfort or an internal struggle with the information being conveyed. These gestures often arise when a person is uncertain or trying to distance themselves psychologically from what they’re saying. Furthermore, the open arms posture might be an attempt to appear transparent or open, but taken together with the somewhat defensive or erratic head movements, it also reflects a genuine effort to communicate openly despite some internal tension.

While none of these behaviors guarantee absolute truth—after all, some people naturally exhibit these nonverbal signals during conversation—the accumulation of these subtle cues, especially the contradictory head movements juxtaposed with intentional eye contact and eyebrow raises, points toward a scenario where the person is likely conveying their honest perspective. Given the complexity and interplay of these signs, I’m inclined to believe the individual is probably being truthful, though I would acknowledge some room for alternative interpretations.

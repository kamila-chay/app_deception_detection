Watching the video closely, there are subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest they might not be telling the truth, though it's not entirely definitive. The way they avoid steady eye contact and occasionally glance away could hint at discomfort or an attempt to mask their emotions, which is often associated with deceit. At the same time, some might argue that these same gestures could simply indicate nervousness or shyness rather than intentional dishonesty.

Moreover, the person's speech patterns appear slightly hesitant, with occasional pauses that might reflect the effort to fabricate or carefully choose their words. However, it's important to consider that such hesitations could also arise from being cautious in phrasing or feeling anxious due to the situation itself, rather than outright lying.

Taking these observations together, while there is no absolute certainty, the combination of avoidance behaviors and speech irregularities leans toward the conclusion that the person is likely not being truthful. Though one must remain cautious in making this assessment, the balance of evidence seems to support that they are indeed lying.

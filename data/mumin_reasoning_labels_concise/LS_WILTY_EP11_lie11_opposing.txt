Watching the video closely, there are several subtle behavioral cues that suggest the person might be fully truthful. For instance, the frequent blinking and raising of eyebrows could indicate a heightened level of stress or discomfort, which often accompanies honesty when someone is being open about difficult topics. The downward shift in the lip corners along with lips protruding may also point toward unease or an attempt to control facial expressions, potentially reflecting genuine feelings rather than deceit. The way the chin moves upwards combined with occasional head turns to the side might be efforts to thoughtfully engage with the narrative they’re presenting or to carefully formulate their responses.

On the other hand, some behaviors such as maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor could be interpreted as an attempt to appear sincere and confident. Similarly, gazing downward or lifting the head might be natural adjustments in posture rather than definitive signs of lying. Still, when you consider the overall pattern of these cues working together rather than in isolation, the balance of evidence leans toward the conclusion that the person is likely being truthful.

Of course, none of these gestures on their own are conclusive proof, as people exhibit such behaviors for various reasons unrelated to dishonesty. Stress, nervousness, or even habit can cause similar reactions. However, given the combination and frequency of these behaviors, along with the context implied by the video, it seems reasonable to assess that the individual is probably telling the truth in this instance. This is an informed inference rather than absolute certainty, but the indicators presented here make the truthfulness hypothesis the more plausible explanation.

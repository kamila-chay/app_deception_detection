Watching the video, the person maintains steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which often signals engagement and sincerity. Their nodding could be interpreted as agreement or affirmation, contributing to an impression of honesty and openness. Additionally, the gesture with palms up is commonly associated with openness and a non-threatening stance, which might suggest that the person is trying to appear transparent and trustworthy.

However, while these behaviors generally indicate honesty, they are not foolproof. Someone who is lying can deliberately use such cues to appear convincing and mask deceit. The consistent gaze, steady nods, and open-palm gestures might be carefully controlled to project confidence and credibility, which can be a tactic rather than a spontaneous sign of truthfulness.

Considering these points, although the person exhibits behaviors typically linked to honesty, there is reason to suspect these actions are performed with intent rather than naturally. The alignment of these gestures in combination could be an effort to persuade and reassure the interlocutor despite the underlying falsehood. Therefore, it seems plausible that the individual is lying, likely leveraging familiar signals of trustworthiness to strengthen their deceit.

Watching the video carefully, it's clear the person maintains a generally calm demeanor, though at moments their gaze shifts upward. This kind of upward gaze can sometimes be interpreted as an attempt to reconstruct a memory or engage in visual recall, which might suggest the person is thoughtfully processing their words. On the other hand, some might argue that looking away or upward could be an indicator of evasion or discomfort, potentially signaling deception.

However, considering the person's overall body language, there’s no obvious tension or nervous fidgeting that would often accompany deceit. The upward gaze here seems more consistent with someone trying to recall details than someone fabricating a story. While it’s important to recognize that behaviors can mean different things depending on context, this individual's behavior aligns more with honest communication than with lying. So, while I can’t say with absolute certainty, the evidence leans toward the person telling the truth.

Watching the video closely, the person exhibits a mixture of facial expressions and gestures that seem somewhat contradictory at first glance. The smile, combined with raised eyebrows, might initially suggest openness or friendliness. However, the exaggerated eye closing and occasional lowering of the lip corners introduce a subtle tension that complicates the overall impression. These micro-expressions could indicate discomfort or an attempt to mask true feelings. The person's gaze shifts noticeably between the interlocutor and sideways, which might reflect an effort to control or avoid direct eye contact, a common behavior when someone is trying to conceal something. The head tilting, often a sign of engagement or curiosity, here feels more like a compensatory gesture, possibly to deflect scrutiny.

While these signs alone aren’t definitive proof of deceit—since some people naturally display nervous ticks or may smile out of politeness—the combination of gestures, especially when viewed in context, leans towards a calculated effort to mislead. The inconsistency between the friendly smile and the more guarded, less confident movements raises a red flag. Taking all this into account, my educated guess is that the person is not being entirely truthful, though I acknowledge that without further corroboration, there remains room for alternative explanations.

Watching the video closely, there are several behavioral cues worth considering in assessing the person's honesty. The individual frequently maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and openness. This kind of direct eye contact can be a sign of confidence and sincerity, although it’s important to remember that some people naturally maintain eye contact regardless of truthfulness.

At times, the person’s gaze drifts upwards. This upward gaze can sometimes be interpreted as an indicator of mental visualization or retrieval of memories, which might support the notion that they are recalling genuine information rather than fabricating it. However, it’s also a behavior sometimes linked to constructing answers, so it’s not definitive on its own.

The gaze sideways noted in the video introduces some ambiguity. Sideways glances can signal distraction or discomfort, but they can also be perfectly natural as one processes thoughts or reacts to environmental stimuli. Without signs of increased tension or other stress indicators, these sideways glances don't strongly undermine credibility.

Weighing these observations, the combination of consistent gaze towards the interlocutor and moments of upward gaze might initially suggest the person is truthful, as these behaviors fit a profile of someone accessing authentic memories while maintaining engagement. However, the sideways gaze adds a subtle layer of uncertainty that, together with the possible constructive nature of the upward gaze, indicates the person could be fabricating information. Thus, while it’s impossible to be absolutely certain from behavior alone, the evidence leans toward this person not telling the truth.

Watching the video, several aspects of the person’s behavior stand out and suggest a degree of discomfort or incongruence that could indicate deception. The smile appears somewhat restrained, almost as if it’s a controlled expression rather than a spontaneous one. This could point to an attempt to mask true emotions or to appear more confident than they actually feel. Additionally, the upward movement of the chin, combined with the head being held up, might be interpreted as a subtle attempt to assert dominance or hide vulnerability; however, this same behavior can also be a natural response in certain conversational contexts, so it’s not a definitive sign on its own.

The gaze shifts are particularly interesting. While the person does look towards their interlocutor, which typically signals engagement and honesty, at times they avert their gaze downward, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or an effort to avoid direct scrutiny. On the other hand, some may argue that looking down can also be a sign of thoughtfulness or reflection rather than deceit. 

Balancing all these cues, it seems plausible that the person is not being entirely truthful. The combination of controlled smiling, assertive chin and head posture, and the mixed gaze directions create a pattern that aligns with common nonverbal indicators of lying, even though none of these behaviors alone would be conclusive. Therefore, while it’s not certain beyond doubt, the evidence leans toward the conclusion that the person is likely being deceptive in this scenario.

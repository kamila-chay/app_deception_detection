Watching the video, the person's behavior gives mixed signals that could suggest either truthfulness or deception, making it a bit challenging to be absolutely certain. One notable behavior is that they maintain gaze towards the interlocutor throughout the conversation. Typically, consistent eye contact can be interpreted as a sign of honesty and engagement, which might lead one to initially consider that the person is being truthful. However, it’s important to recognize that some individuals consciously use steady eye contact as a tactic to mask dishonesty, aiming to appear more credible.

Given this, while the direct gaze might initially lower suspicion, it's also possible that this behavior is a deliberate effort to convince the viewer or listener of their sincerity. Without additional behavioral cues, the steady gaze alone does not rule out deception and, in fact, might be a subtle signal of it. Considering these nuances, my educated guess leans toward the person not being entirely truthful, though it remains a judgment that acknowledges the limitations of interpreting truthfulness based on a single observed behavior.

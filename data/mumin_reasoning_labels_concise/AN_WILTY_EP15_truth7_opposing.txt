Watching the video, it’s notable that the person maintains a steady gaze toward the interlocutor, which generally suggests engagement and openness. People who are truthful often maintain direct eye contact to convey sincerity, so this steady gaze could be an indicator leaning toward honesty. On the other hand, frequent blinking is sometimes interpreted as a sign of nervousness or stress, which might raise some suspicion. However, blinking can also be influenced by many benign factors such as lighting conditions or simply normal physiological responses, so it would be a stretch to conclude deception solely on that basis.

Considering these behavioral cues collectively, the steady gaze weighs more significantly as a sign of truthfulness, while the frequent blinking alone isn’t enough to suggest deceit. While we can never be 100% certain purely based on behavioral observation, the signals present here seem to align more consistently with someone who is telling the truth rather than fabricating their story.

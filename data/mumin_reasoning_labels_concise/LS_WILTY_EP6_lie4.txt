Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues that could suggest they might not be entirely truthful. Notably, their lip corners tend to pull downward, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or dissatisfaction—potentially a subtle sign of underlying stress that could accompany fabricating information. At the same time, they maintain steady gaze towards the interlocutor, which is somewhat counterintuitive, as people who lie often avoid direct eye contact. However, this steady gaze could be a conscious effort to appear sincere and trustworthy, a tactic commonly used by those who wish to conceal deception.

While the downward lip corners might be a natural expression unrelated to deceit, combined with the strong eye contact, it’s possible the person is overcompensating, trying too hard to seem credible. This kind of behavior can sometimes be a red flag, suggesting that despite their apparent confidence, they might be masking dishonesty. Given these observations, it feels reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely not telling the truth, though it is always important to consider that these signals can have alternative explanations. Ultimately, the subtle tension in their facial expression coupled with the deliberate gaze makes lying a plausible interpretation.

Upon observing the person's behavior in the video, several subtle cues stand out that might suggest deception, although none are definitive on their own. For example, the occasional protrusion of the lips could indicate discomfort or an attempt to suppress a truthful response. Additionally, movements such as the chin rising or the head moving forward might reflect a degree of defensiveness or an effort to assert control over the conversation. The shifting gaze—alternating between looking at the interlocutor and then down—could further point to internal conflict or an attempt to fabricate information while managing social dynamics.

On the other hand, such behaviors might also arise from nervousness, distraction, or even natural patterns of communication under stress that don't necessarily signify lying. Head movements like turning to the side or moving backward could represent disengagement or contemplation rather than deception. Nonetheless, when these behaviors are considered collectively and in context, the likelihood that the person is being untruthful seems higher. While none of these indicators alone can confirm deceit, the overall pattern aligns more closely with someone who is not conveying straightforward honesty. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the person is probably lying, although there remains some uncertainty given the subtle nature of these cues.

Watching the video, the person appears to be quite engaged, smiling naturally and maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor. These behaviors often signal openness and comfort, which can be associated with honesty. However, it’s important to recognize that people can smile and maintain eye contact even when being deceptive, either consciously or unconsciously, as part of an effort to appear credible.

Interestingly, the individual also looks upward and downward at times. Gaze aversion, such as looking away or up, is sometimes interpreted as a sign of fabricating or retrieving fabricated information. Yet, these upward and downward glances can also simply reflect moments of thought or introspection, especially when someone is recounting events or searching memory to provide accurate details.

Balancing these observations, the natural smile and consistent eye contact suggest a level of comfort and straightforwardness that leans toward deceptiveness. The occasional gaze shifts could be part of a constructed memory search rather than signs of genuine recall. Given this combination, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is likely being untruthful, though it’s always good to consider that any single behavior can have multiple interpretations.

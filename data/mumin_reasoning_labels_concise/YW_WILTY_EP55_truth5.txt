Watching the video closely, several behaviors stand out that seem to suggest the person is being sincere. Their lip corners are slightly upturned, which can be a subtle indicator of genuine engagement or positive affect rather than forced smiles often linked to deceit. The sustained gaze towards the interlocutor also adds credibility; maintaining eye contact typically reflects openness and confidence, whereas frequent avoidance might hint at discomfort or evasion.

That said, the occasional sideways gaze and nod could be interpreted in different ways. A gaze away from the interlocutor might sometimes signal internal processing or momentary uncertainty, but it can also be a natural part of thoughtful conversation rather than a sign of dishonesty. Nodding in response tends to support agreement or understanding, which aligns well with truthful communication, though it could also be a social tactic to appear agreeable.

Taking all these behaviors into account, the balance of evidence leans towards honesty. While no single behavior guarantees truthfulness, the combination of positive facial expressions, consistent eye contact, and affirmative gestures creates a picture that fits well with someone who is telling the truth. Of course, one must always consider context and individual differences, but based on these cues, the educated guess would be that the person is not lying.

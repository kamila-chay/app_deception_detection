Watching the video, the person’s demeanor strikes me as fairly genuine, though there are subtle nuances worth considering. Their gaze is directed toward the interlocutor most of the time, which often suggests engagement and an attempt to connect truthfully. However, there are moments where their eyes drift sideways, which could sometimes indicate discomfort or an effort to recall details. This kind of behavior might raise a slight suspicion in some contexts, but it can also be a natural response when someone is thinking carefully or processing information.

The retraction of the lips adds another layer to the interpretation. While it can be interpreted as a sign of tension or nervousness, it is not necessarily indicative of deception. People often exhibit small facial movements when they are under mild stress or simply concentrating on expressing themselves clearly, especially in a video setting.

Taken together, the balance of maintained gaze towards the listener against occasional sideways glances, along with the lip movement, might initially suggest a cautious approach, but these cues do not conclusively point to deception. The combination of these behaviors could be consistent with someone experiencing uncertainty rather than constructing a false narrative. While uncertainty always remains with nonverbal behavior, I feel reasonably confident that this person is not being deceptive based on the subtle, mostly open engagement and lack of overt avoidance or defensive gestures.

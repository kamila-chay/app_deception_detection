Watching the video closely, there are several subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. For instance, the smile and the slight raising of the eyebrows could be interpreted as attempts to project openness or friendliness, which people sometimes use to mask discomfort or to make their statements seem more credible. The frequent blinking is another behavior that often correlates with cognitive load or nervousness, which might indicate that the person is trying to keep track of a fabricated story or manage the stress of deception.

At the same time, the person maintains direct gaze toward the interlocutor and even nods occasionally, which generally conveys engagement and honesty. Open arms can also be a sign of openness and vulnerability, seemingly reinforcing trustworthiness. However, in some cases, such gestures might be consciously adopted to create a false sense of sincerity.

Considering these factors together, it feels like the behaviors producing mixed signals are more likely strategic rather than natural, which raises some doubts about the truthfulness of the person. While none of these signs alone can definitively prove deception, the constellation of nervous indicators alongside consciously friendly and open gestures suggests that the person is not being fully honest. Thus, my best educated guess is that the individual is likely lying, although it's important to keep in mind that behavioral cues are not infallible indicators.

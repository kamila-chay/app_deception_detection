Watching the video closely, there are a few subtle behavioral cues that stand out, which might suggest the person is not being entirely truthful. Their gaze shifts toward the interlocutor at times, which often indicates engagement, but then occasionally drifts upward—a gesture some studies link to cognitive effort, as if they are trying to carefully construct or recall information rather than recount it naturally. This upward glance could reflect the mental load involved in fabricating details or holding back the truth. Additionally, the presence of shrugging adds a layer of ambiguity; it might be interpreted as a nonverbal way of expressing uncertainty or defensiveness, possibly an attempt to downplay responsibility or avoid providing a firm answer.

That said, none of these signals alone definitively prove deception. People can look upward when they genuinely think or reflect, and shrugging is a common and often innocuous gesture. Their gaze toward the interlocutor could be a sign of honesty and openness rather than concealment. However, when considering these behaviors collectively—the upward gaze suggesting cognitive strain combined with a shrug that might signify discomfort or evasion—it leans toward the interpretation that the individual is not fully forthcoming. While this assessment isn't absolute, the interplay of these subtle cues gives a reasoned basis to suspect that the person might be lying.

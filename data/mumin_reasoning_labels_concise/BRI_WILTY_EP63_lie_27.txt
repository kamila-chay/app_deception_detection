Watching the video closely, there are a few subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest some level of discomfort or dishonesty. One notable detail is the crossing of the fingers, which can often be an unconscious gesture associated with telling an untruth or hoping to avoid consequences. While this alone isn’t definitive proof of lying—people might cross their fingers out of habit or nervousness—it does raise a red flag when paired with other body language indicators like avoiding eye contact or pauses in speech. 

On the other hand, it’s important to consider that crossing fingers can sometimes be a self-soothing mechanism, possibly reflecting anxiety or stress unrelated to deception. This means the person could simply be nervous rather than intentionally misleading. However, given the context and the subtle unease that accompanies the gesture, I lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely not being entirely truthful. The combination of these behaviors, especially one as symbolically linked to dishonesty as crossing fingers, makes it reasonable to suspect they are lying, even if there’s a chance it could stem from something else. Overall, the evidence points more toward deception than honesty in this scenario.

Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues that make me lean toward the conclusion that they are likely to be fully truthful. For instance, the raising of eyebrows often signals an attempt to emphasize a point or convey sincerity, and in this context, it aligns well with the message being conveyed. Paired with a steady gaze toward the interlocutor, it indicates that the person is genuinely engaged in the interaction and confident in their honesty.

However, one could argue that maintaining direct eye contact and expressive facial gestures, like eyebrow raises, might sometimes be perceived as rehearsed or exaggerated, but in this case, these behaviors appear authentic and natural. A genuinely truthful person might also display these behaviors when explaining something important or difficult, which seems to be what is happening here. The combination feels sincere rather than contrived.

Given these observations, although it’s possible that these behaviors might sometimes be misinterpreted, the overall impression is that the person is being open and truthful. The natural expressiveness behind those eyebrow raises and the focused gaze suggest that the individual is honestly conveying their message, rather than attempting to mask the truth.

Watching the video closely, there are several subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest they might be entirely truthful. For instance, the smile and the slight raising of the eyebrows could be interpreted as genuine attempts to project openness or friendliness, which people naturally use to communicate comfort and make their statements more credible. The frequent blinking is another behavior that often correlates with cognitive engagement or attentiveness, which might indicate that the person is thoughtfully responding and managing their thoughts sincerely.

At the same time, the person maintains direct gaze toward the interlocutor and even nods occasionally, which generally conveys engagement and honesty. Open arms can also be a sign of openness and vulnerability, seemingly reinforcing trustworthiness. However, in some cases, such gestures might be consciously adopted to create a false sense of sincerity.

Considering these factors together, it feels like the behaviors producing mixed signals are more likely natural rather than strategic, which supports the truthfulness of the person. While none of these signs alone can definitively prove honesty, the constellation of engagement indicators alongside consciously friendly and open gestures suggests that the person is being fully honest. Thus, my best educated guess is that the individual is likely telling the truth, although it's important to keep in mind that behavioral cues are not infallible indicators.

Watching the video carefully, the person maintains a fairly consistent gaze towards their interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and honesty. However, there are moments where their gaze shifts sideways, which might indicate discomfort or a subtle attempt to avoid direct eye contact. This kind of lateral glance can sometimes be a sign of someone who is formulating a response rather than speaking naturally. Additionally, their nodding behavior could be interpreted in multiple ways—it might show agreement and confidence, or alternatively, it could be an unconscious attempt to persuade or reassure the listener.

While these behaviors individually could point toward truthful communication, the combination of steady gaze interrupted by occasional sideways glances, paired with somewhat frequent nodding, raises a suspicion. The sideways gaze seems slightly out of place in an otherwise engaged demeanor, hinting at internal conflict or hesitation. Given these factors and considering the subtle inconsistencies in their nonverbal cues, it leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person may not be fully truthful. That said, these behaviors are not definitive proof of deception on their own; they merely suggest there might be something concealed beneath the surface. Overall, the evidence leans more toward the person lying, though it's important to acknowledge this interpretation carries some uncertainty.

Observing the person’s behavior in the video, there are subtle yet telling cues that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. The facial expressions, particularly the scowl combined with the frowning eyebrows and the downward pull at the corners of the lips, hint at some level of discomfort or negative emotion. These expressions can sometimes indicate frustration or agitation, which might arise when someone is fabricating information or feels pressured to maintain a falsehood. 

The gaze directed towards the interlocutor is interesting because maintaining eye contact can be a way to appear credible, but it can also be a bit forced when someone is lying, as they might overcompensate to avoid suspicion. Additionally, the head shaking is a bit contradictory—it often signals disagreement or denial, which could be an unconscious attempt to reject a truth the person is uncomfortable facing, or a deliberate gesture to discredit what they are being asked about.

That said, none of these behaviors guarantee deception on their own; for example, someone could show similar signs simply from stress or disagreement rather than dishonesty. However, considering the combination of expressions and gestures in this context, it seems more likely that the individual's behavior aligns with someone who is not telling the truth. While it’s important to acknowledge the potential for alternative explanations, the overall impression leans toward this person being deceptive, albeit with some reservation due to the nuanced nature of human behavior.

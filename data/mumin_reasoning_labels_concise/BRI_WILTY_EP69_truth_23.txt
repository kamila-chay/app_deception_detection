Watching the video, the person's behavior seems consistent with someone who is telling the truth, though it’s never completely straightforward to be certain. There are moments when their gaze shifts upward and sideways, which could suggest they are accessing information or thinking carefully about what to say. Often, people who fabricate stories might avoid direct eye contact or exhibit more nervous body language, but this individual doesn’t display overt signs of discomfort or deception. That said, gaze aversion can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of dishonesty, so it’s understandable to consider that possibility. However, in this context, the gaze patterns appear more like natural cognitive processing rather than evasiveness. Overall, while one can never be absolutely sure purely from nonverbal cues, the evidence here leans toward the person being truthful.

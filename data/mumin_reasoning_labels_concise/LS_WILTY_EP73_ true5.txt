Watching the video, the individual's behavior suggests a level of engagement and sincerity that leans toward truthfulness. The person frequently raises their eyebrows, which can indicate openness and an attempt to communicate honestly rather than deceive. Coupled with a steady gaze towards the interlocutor, this suggests attentiveness and confidence in what is being said, as opposed to evasiveness or discomfort that might accompany deceit. The occasional nod reinforces the impression that the person is affirming their statements and is in agreement with the conversation, adding to the sense of authenticity. 

That said, it's important to acknowledge that none of these behaviors are foolproof indicators of truthfulness. Raising eyebrows can sometimes be an attempt to feign surprise or innocence, while maintaining eye contact might be a rehearsed tactic to appear credible. Similarly, nodding can be a social cue rather than a genuine sign of assent. However, when taken together in this context, these cues build a reasonable case for the person telling the truth. While absolute certainty is elusive, the combination of these subtle behaviors aligns more closely with honesty than deception.

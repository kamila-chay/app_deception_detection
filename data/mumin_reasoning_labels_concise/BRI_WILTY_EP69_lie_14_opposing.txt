Watching the person's behavior closely, there are a few subtle cues that might suggest some level of discomfort or hesitation. For instance, their eyebrows occasionally raise, which can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to convey sincerity. At the same time, their gaze tends to drift sideways rather than maintaining direct eye contact, a classic sign that could hint at trying to avoid scrutiny or conceal something. Additionally, the person nods during their speech, which might be an effort to reinforce their statements and appear more convincing.

On the other hand, these behaviors individually are not definitive proof of lying. Raising eyebrows could simply reflect a natural expression or reaction to the conversation, while looking sideways might be due to thinking or referencing something nearby, rather than deceit. Nodding can be a genuine way of engaging with the listener or encouraging agreement.

However, when considering these behaviors collectively and in the context of the person’s overall demeanor, there seems to be a subtle pattern consistent with someone being honest and open. The combination of brief eyebrow raises, avoiding steady eye contact, and the seemingly purposeful nodding suggests that the person is genuinely engaged and sincere. While it's difficult to be absolutely certain without additional information, these cues together support the interpretation that the person is likely being truthful.

Watching the video closely, there are several subtle behavioral cues that suggest the person is entirely truthful. For instance, the combination of raising eyebrows and alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and then glancing sideways could signal attentiveness and an effort to engage with the listener, which often accompanies honesty. The movements of the chin, fluctuating between upward and downward motions, alongside shifts in head position—both tilting and side-turning—may indicate thoughtful consideration or an attempt to convey sincerity.

On the other hand, these behaviors could also be interpreted as natural responses to stress or nervousness, rather than clear signs of untruthfulness. Sometimes, heightened attention or confusion can prompt similar gestures without any intent to deceive. However, when these signals appear together repeatedly, especially combined with subtle forward and backward head motions, it strengthens the impression that the person is genuinely expressing their thoughts.

While no single behavior conclusively proves honesty, the pattern and combination of these actions more likely point to the person being completely honest in their communication. Therefore, considering the context and the behaviors exhibited, it seems reasonable to estimate that the person is telling the truth, though it remains an educated guess rather than a certainty.

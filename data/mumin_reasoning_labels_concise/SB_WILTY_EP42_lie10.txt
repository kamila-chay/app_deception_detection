Watching the person's behavior carefully, several subtle cues stand out that might suggest they are not being entirely truthful. The frequent blinking could indicate increased cognitive load or stress, which often accompanies deceit. At the same time, the repeated movements of the chin—both upwards and downwards—might reflect some internal conflict or uncertainty, as if the person is trying to reconcile what they're saying with what they actually believe. Their gaze shifts between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing downward, which may signal discomfort or attempts to avoid full eye contact, another potential sign of dishonesty.

However, some behaviors temper this interpretation. The occasional nod might suggest they’re trying to appear cooperative or convincing. An open arm posture could imply openness and honesty, but in some cases, it can be a conscious effort to mask deceit. The head turning sideways may be an indication of defensiveness or hesitation but could also simply be a natural response to the conversational context.

Taken together, these behavioral elements create a mixed but telling picture. While none of these signs alone definitively prove lying, the overall pattern—particularly the combination of frequent blinking, variable chin movements, shifting gaze, and subtle head turns—leans towards the person struggling with their honesty. It’s plausible to conclude, though not with absolute certainty, that the individual is likely being deceptive in this interaction.

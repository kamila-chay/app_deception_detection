Observing the individual's behavior in the video, several nonverbal cues stand out, which can offer some insight into their truthfulness. The person frequently changes their gaze direction—sometimes looking up, then down, and occasionally sideways. Such gaze shifts can sometimes suggest cognitive processing or searching for memories, which might indicate that the person is constructing or recalling information rather than fabricating it. Their consistent nodding and subtle head tilting also suggest engagement and a certain level of comfort with what is being communicated, which often aligns with honesty.

On the other hand, one might argue that avoiding steady eye contact through gaze shifts could be interpreted as evasiveness or discomfort, potentially signaling deception. Yet, it's important to recognize that individuals often naturally exhibit these tendencies when trying to recall specific details or to emphasize sincerity. The head side-turns and occasional upward head movements can be read as reflective gestures rather than defensive ones.

Given these observations, while there is reason to believe the person might be truthful based solely on nonverbal behavior, the synthesis of these cues leans towards the person engaging in deception. The combination of engaged nodding, varied but non-avoidant gaze, and open head movements can sometimes mask dishonesty in this context. However, it remains a somewhat cautious judgment, given the variability in how people express themselves nonverbally.

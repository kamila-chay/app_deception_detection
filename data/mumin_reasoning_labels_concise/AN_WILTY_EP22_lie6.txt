Watching the video, I noticed several subtle behaviors that caught my attention. The person frequently shifts their gaze between looking directly at the interlocutor and then quickly glancing downward. This back-and-forth in eye movement can sometimes suggest an internal conflict or discomfort, which might arise when someone is being less than truthful. Additionally, there are moments where the head tilts slightly, followed by a brief lifting of the head. These opposing head movements could indicate uncertainty or attempts to gauge the listener's reaction, both of which can be associated with deceit.

Another intriguing aspect is the use of hand gestures, specifically the palms facing upward at certain points. Palms-up gestures often signal a plea for trust or an attempt to appear open and honest. However, when paired with the other behaviors mentioned, this gesture might be serving as a compensatory mechanism to mask underlying dishonesty.

On the other hand, some could argue that these behaviors are simply nervous habits or signs of someone carefully considering their words, especially in a situation that might be stressful but truthful nonetheless. People vary widely in their communication styles, so none of these signs alone definitively prove deception.

Still, taken together, the combination of shifting gazes, mixed head movements, and strategic hand gestures suggests a level of discomfort and perhaps an effort to manage the impression being made. While I can't say with absolute certainty, these subtle cues lean toward the conclusion that the person might not be fully truthful in the video.

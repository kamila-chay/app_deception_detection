Watching the video, it’s interesting to observe the person's shifting gaze behavior. At times, they maintain eye contact with their interlocutor, which often suggests confidence and a willingness to engage openly. Yet, this is punctuated with moments where their gaze drops downward, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid scrutiny. This back-and-forth pattern could suggest a subtle internal conflict—they want to appear truthful but are simultaneously uneasy.

One could argue that looking down doesn’t definitively mean deception; it could simply reflect nervousness or shyness. After all, some people look away frequently even when being honest. However, in this case, considering the mix of direct eye contact and sudden gaze aversions, it seems there might be an effort to manage how much information is being revealed. The person appears to be carefully controlling their nonverbal cues, which often aligns with someone who is not fully forthcoming.

While it’s difficult to be absolutely certain based on gaze alone, the combination of deliberate engagement followed by avoidance suggests the likelihood of deception. The person’s behavior feels somewhat calculated—trying to convince while subtly concealing something—pointing toward the conclusion that they are likely not telling the whole truth.

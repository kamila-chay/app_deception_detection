Watching the video closely, there are several behavioral cues that suggest the person is likely being truthful. For instance, the combination of a smile paired with raised eyebrows and the lip corners turning upward signals friendliness and openness, indicating genuine expression. The upward movement of the chin and the gaze directed at the interlocutor imply assertiveness and confidence, and although the gaze occasionally shifts downward or sideways, this can reflect thoughtfulness or moments of reflection rather than hesitation or deceit.

Furthermore, the subtle tilting and turning of the head, along with shaking, could indicate engagement and active listening rather than uncertainty or deflection. The openness of the arms appears to show vulnerability and honesty, reinforcing the impression of sincerity. While none of these behaviors conclusively prove truthfulness on their own—since people exhibit a wide range of nonverbal cues for many reasons—the overall pattern here leans toward the person being honest. Their actions suggest a straightforward communication style, which supports the assessment that they are likely telling the truth.

Watching the video, I noticed that the person consistently directed their gaze towards the interlocutor, which ordinarily suggests engagement and honesty. Maintaining eye contact typically indicates transparency, as people who are truthful tend to look at the person they are speaking with, reinforcing the credibility of their words. Additionally, their arms were open during the conversation, a posture often associated with openness and receptiveness rather than defensiveness or concealment.

However, despite these seemingly genuine gestures, there was also a notable head shaking—a subtle cue that might indicate internal disagreement or discomfort with what is being said. Head shaking during a statement may suggest that the person is signaling doubt or rejection of their own words, consciously or subconsciously. This contradiction between the open body language and the negative head gesture creates a bit of cognitive dissonance, making it more intriguing to consider their true intent.

While it's certainly possible that the head shaking was an unconscious habit or a reaction unrelated to deceit, when combined with the other behavioral cues in this context, it supports the likelihood that the person is being truthful. The mixed signals reflect the complexity of human communication, where honesty can coexist with moments of uncertainty or self-reflection. Considering these factors, I would lean towards the assessment that the person is likely telling the truth, though it remains an educated guess rather than an absolute conclusion.

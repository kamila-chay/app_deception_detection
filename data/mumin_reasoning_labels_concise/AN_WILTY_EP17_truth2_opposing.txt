Watching the video, I noticed the person’s gaze shifts between looking directly at the interlocutor and occasionally glancing downward. This pattern caught my attention because, on one hand, maintaining eye contact can signal openness and sincerity. The gaze towards the interlocutor suggests engagement and a willingness to communicate honestly.

However, the moments when the person looks down could be interpreted in a few ways. People sometimes look away or down when they are formulating their thoughts, feeling a bit uncertain, or processing complex information rather than necessarily being deceptive. It’s also common for truthful individuals to exhibit such behavior when discussing sensitive topics or recalling details, as they might be inwardly focused or a bit self-conscious.

Considering both aspects together, it seems likely that the downward gaze is consistent with truthfulness. If someone were lying, they might avoid eye contact more consistently or display nervousness in other visible ways, but here, the combination of steady engagement with moments of introspection feels sincere. While we can never be completely certain from behavior alone, my best educated guess is that this person is telling the truth, with their gaze patterns reflecting thoughtfulness rather than deceit.

Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some intriguing signals that suggest they are likely being truthful. Their lips appear retracted at times, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or tension—a subtle cue that might reflect the strain of dealing with a difficult truth. When considering their gaze patterns, they often look toward the interlocutor, which could be an attempt to maintain engagement or gauge the reaction of the listener, possibly to communicate honestly and clearly. Additionally, the moments when their gaze shifts upward or sideways are noteworthy; such eye movements are sometimes associated with the cognitive effort involved in recalling or thoughtfully constructing information, rather than fabricating it.

On the other hand, one could argue that maintaining eye contact and displaying such gaze shifts might be natural reactions or even strategies to appear truthful. People vary widely in how they behave under scrutiny, and these gestures alone don’t definitively indicate deception. However, when these behaviors converge—lip tension coupled with gaze shifts and upward glances—the balance of probabilities leans toward the person feeling earnest and sincere. While I can't be absolutely certain without further context, the combination of these subtle but telling cues suggests that the person is likely telling the truth in this instance.

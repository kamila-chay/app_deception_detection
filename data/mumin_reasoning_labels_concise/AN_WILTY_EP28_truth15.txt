Watching the video, the person's behavior appears quite natural and consistent with someone who is likely telling the truth. Their gaze is primarily directed towards the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and a willingness to communicate openly. While there are moments when the person’s gaze shifts sideways and their head turns slightly to the side, these actions can be interpreted as thoughtful gestures rather than signs of deceit. People often look away briefly when processing information or recalling memories, and a sideward glance doesn’t necessarily equate to dishonesty.

That said, some might argue that avoiding direct eye contact or turning the head away could indicate discomfort or a desire to hide something. However, in this scenario, the behavior doesn’t seem forced or exaggerated; rather, it feels spontaneous and congruent with someone who is genuinely speaking their truth. The overall demeanor and the subtle nonverbal cues do not raise significant red flags that would typically be associated with lying. Given these observations, it seems reasonable to conclude—albeit cautiously—that the person is most likely being truthful.

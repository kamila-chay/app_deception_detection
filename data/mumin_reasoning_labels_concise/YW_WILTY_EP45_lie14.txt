Watching the video, the person’s expressions and body language suggest a level of discomfort that could be indicative of deception, though it’s important to consider alternative explanations. For instance, the scowl combined with raised eyebrows might typically signal surprise or confusion, but in some contexts, it could also reflect frustration or internal conflict, which might arise when someone is not being truthful. The slight upward pull at the corners of the lips adds an ambiguous layer—it could be an involuntary nervous smile rather than genuine amusement, potentially a subconscious effort to mask tension.

The gaze behavior is particularly telling here. Alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways could suggest an attempt to engage while simultaneously avoiding full eye contact, a common sign in people who might be fabricating information or experiencing cognitive load. Yet, one could argue that such gaze shifts might also be a natural reaction during complex conversations or moments of uncertainty, not necessarily deception.

The head shaking stands out as a more definitive cue; it generally indicates disagreement or denial but, paired with the other signs, may underscore subconscious resistance to the truth being told. On balance, while each individual behavior might have valid non-deceptive reasons, the combination and context hint toward the person not being entirely truthful. So, based on the subtle yet telling interplay of these expressions and movements, the evidence leans reasonably towards the conclusion that the person is lying, though there remains a margin for alternative interpretations.

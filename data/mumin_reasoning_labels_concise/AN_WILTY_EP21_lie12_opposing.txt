Watching this video, I noticed a few behaviors that caught my attention. The person maintains gaze toward the interlocutor, which could suggest engagement and honesty, as people tend to look at the person they are speaking to when they want to be convincing. However, the gaze shifting upwards is often associated with someone trying to access memories or construct a story, which might hint at recalling a truthful event rather than fabrication. Additionally, the head shaking is intriguing—it could indicate disagreement or discomfort, perhaps an unconscious sign of internal conflict or doubt, but also a sign of genuine reflection about what is being said.

Considering these behaviors together, it seems plausible that the person is telling the truth. The steady gaze reinforces sincerity, while the upward gaze and head shaking indicate honest cognitive processing and emotional engagement. Of course, none of these cues alone guarantees truthfulness, as they can vary greatly among individuals and contexts. Still, in this case, the combination of a potentially sincere gaze and subtle signs of thoughtful discomfort leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely being truthful.

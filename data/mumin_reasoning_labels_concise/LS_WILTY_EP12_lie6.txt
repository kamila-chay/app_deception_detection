Observing the person's behavior in the video, there are several subtle but telling signs that suggest the possibility of deception, though it's important to acknowledge that none of these alone can conclusively prove lying. The frequent blinking could indicate increased cognitive load or anxiety, often associated with trying to fabricate or withhold information. The exaggerated opening of the mouth and the slight upward movement of the chin might reflect an overcompensation to appear convincing or truthful, as these movements can sometimes be unconscious attempts to assert credibility. Interestingly, the lip corners lift in a way that resembles a forced smile rather than genuine expression, which might point to discomfort or an effort to mask true feelings.

Regarding eye behavior, the gaze shifts between looking directly at the interlocutor, downwards, and sideways. This pattern might reflect internal conflict or an effort to avoid sustained eye contact, a common yet not definitive indicator of dishonesty. The head movements also seem somewhat inconsistent: while the head tilts and side-turns could be interpreted as engagement or thoughtfulness, the backward movement may suggest a subtle withdrawal or distancing from what is being said.

Of course, none of these behaviors guarantee that the individual is lying, as they could be experiencing nervousness unrelated to deceit or simply be reacting to the social dynamics of the situation. However, taken together, the combination of physical cues—frequent blinking, exaggerated mouth movements, inconsistent gaze patterns, and mixed head gestures—leans toward the interpretation that the person may indeed be concealing the truth. While it's not definitive, the overall pattern appears more aligned with deception than with straightforward honesty.

Watching the video closely, the person’s behavior initially raises some questions. Their gaze often shifts downward and occasionally darts to the side, which some might interpret as signs of discomfort or evasion often associated with dishonesty. However, these behaviors alone don’t definitively indicate lying. It’s important to consider context; looking down can sometimes be a natural response to processing thoughts or illustrating sincerity rather than avoidance. Similarly, sideways glances might suggest an attempt to recall information or even mild nervousness, which doesn’t necessarily equate to deceit.

Taking these factors into account, it seems more plausible that the person is being deceptive. The absence of more overt signs of truthfulness—like steady eye contact or open body language—supports the idea that their downward and sideways gazes might reflect an effort to hide something rather than internal cognitive activity. While it’s impossible to be absolutely certain without additional information, the overall impression here leans toward dishonesty, especially given the subtlety of the observed behaviors.

Watching the video, the person’s behavior raises some interesting questions. Their frequent blinking could suggest they’re feeling a bit uneasy or pressured, which sometimes aligns with someone who is under stress but still telling the truth. The shifts in gaze, especially when they look down or sideways, might indicate discomfort or an attempt to process their thoughts, which people often do when they're being honest but cautious. However, one could argue that looking towards the interlocutor shows they are still trying to engage and not completely withdraw, which might suggest honesty or at least a desire to appear sincere.

Yet, considering the combination of these subtle cues—especially the inconsistent gaze patterns combined with the blinking—it feels like the person is struggling internally, which often accompanies earnestness. While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove truthfulness, together they paint a picture that leans toward the person being genuine. So, while it’s not an absolute certainty, the evidence here reasonably supports the conclusion that the individual is likely telling the truth.

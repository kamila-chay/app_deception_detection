Watching the video closely, the person's behavior presents a mixed picture that warrants careful consideration. On one hand, their gaze directed consistently towards the interlocutor might be interpreted as a sign of engagement and sincerity, suggesting they are open and truthful in the conversation. Maintaining eye contact can often indicate confidence and honesty, as someone lying may be more prone to avoid direct gaze.

However, this is complicated by the noticeable sideways glances that intermittently break that direct connection. Such shifts in gaze could point to internal discomfort or attempts to conceal thoughts, which are sometimes associated with deception. People who lie might avert their eyes or look away sideways as they struggle to maintain their fabricated narrative or monitor the listener’s reactions.

Balancing these observations, it seems plausible that the person is trying to appear truthful by holding their gaze but is simultaneously betraying their unease through those sideways looks. This subtle tension between engagement and avoidance could be a behavioral indicator that they are not fully forthcoming. While none of these cues alone can definitively prove deception, the combination of maintaining a gaze with occasional side glances aligns more closely with someone who is lying than with someone who is reliably truthful. Therefore, based on this behavioral pattern, the educated guess leans toward the person not being entirely honest, even though this conclusion remains somewhat tentative given the complexity of human nonverbal communication.

Watching the video carefully, several subtle cues stand out that make me lean toward the person being entirely truthful. The individual's gaze shifts upward at moments when one might expect steady eye contact, which could suggest they're thoughtfully recalling a genuine memory rather than constructing a response. At the same time, they maintain gaze toward the interlocutor often enough to demonstrate engagement, which indicates sincerity rather than evasiveness. The repeated nodding adds an interesting layer—it could be an effort to reinforce their statements and gain implicit agreement, or it might simply serve as a natural gesture of confidence and reassurance.

On the other hand, these behaviors could be interpreted differently. Maintaining gaze towards the listener often shows confidence and honesty, and nodding might simply reflect active listening or encouragement. The upward gaze could be a natural thought process or reflection rather than a sign of deceit. Weighing these possibilities, the combination and timing of these cues—especially the upward gaze interspersed with direct eye contact and nodding—support the idea that the person is being truthful. While not definitive on its own, the behavioral pattern aligns more closely with someone who is honest and forthcoming.

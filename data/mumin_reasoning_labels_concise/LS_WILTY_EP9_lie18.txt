Watching the video closely, the person's behavior appears somewhat inconsistent when viewed through the lens of truthfulness. At first glance, their smile and the slight upward curve of the lip corners might suggest a level of comfort or sincerity. However, given the context, these cues can be misleading. Smiling can sometimes be a strategic tool, deployed to mask discomfort or to appear more convincing.

The frequent blinking could be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, it might simply reflect natural eye movement or a reaction to stress, but on the other hand, it can also be a sign of nervousness or cognitive strain, often associated with fabricating information. Their gaze remains directed at the interlocutor, which typically signals engagement and honesty, yet it's possible this focus is consciously maintained to strengthen trust, rather than emerging spontaneously.

Additionally, nodding and head tilting are generally seen as signs of agreement and empathy, but when considered together with the other behaviors, they might be deliberate attempts to persuade or placate. The combination of these elements doesn't conclusively prove deceit, as each could occur in truthful communication as well. However, the overall pattern—the forced smile, inconsistent nervous signals, and potentially calculated affirming gestures—tips the balance toward the person likely not being entirely truthful. It’s certainly a nuanced interpretation, but weighing the subtleties, the evidence leans toward deception.

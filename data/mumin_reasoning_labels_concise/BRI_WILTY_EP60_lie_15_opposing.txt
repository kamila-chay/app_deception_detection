Watching the video closely, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues that could be interpreted in different ways. Their gaze shifts frequently, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking sideways. This kind of pattern can sometimes suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid full eye contact, which may be indicative of deception. People who are lying often struggle to maintain steady eye contact, as doing so requires a level of confidence and consistency that dishonesty can undermine.

On the other hand, it’s also possible that these gaze shifts are simply natural responses to thinking or recalling information, rather than outright signs of lying. Some individuals naturally avert their eyes when processing thoughts or formulating answers, even when they are being truthful. So, the sideways glances alone aren’t definitive proof of deceit.

However, given the combination of these behaviors and the subtle tension in their expression, it seems more likely that the person is being entirely forthright. The gaze patterns, coupled with a certain hesitancy visible in their demeanor, lean toward an educated guess that they are indeed telling the truth. While it's difficult to be absolutely certain without additional context or corroborating information, the evidence in their nonverbal cues points toward sincerity in this instance.

Watching the video, it’s clear that the person maintains intermittent eye contact, alternating between looking directly at their interlocutor and glancing downward. This shifting gaze pattern can be somewhat ambiguous. On one hand, steady eye contact often suggests confidence and sincerity, so the moments when they gaze down could imply discomfort or hesitation, which might be a subtle sign of honesty. The downward gaze might be an unconscious attempt to process thoughts or reflect sincerely, which supports their truthfulness.

At the same time, the occasional nodding could be interpreted in different ways. It might signal agreement or an effort to appear cooperative and truthful. However, nodding can also be a method to reinforce genuine communication and show engagement. Given this mixed behavior, it’s not straightforward to declare deception solely based on these cues.

Yet, when considering the combination—intermittent gaze shifts away from the speaker paired with noticeable nodding that feels somewhat deliberate—it leans toward the person trying to convey honesty rather than convince. While it’s possible that the individual might just be nervous or unsure, the subtle nonverbal hints suggest an open engagement rather than guarded communication. Therefore, weighing these factors carefully, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely being truthful in this instance, even though some uncertainty remains.

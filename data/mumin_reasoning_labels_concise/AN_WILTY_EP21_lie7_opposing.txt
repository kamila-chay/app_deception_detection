Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues that suggest they are likely truthful. One thing that stands out is that they maintain eye contact with the interlocutor, which could be interpreted as a sign of honesty or confidence. People who lie often avoid direct gaze, so this could initially argue against deception. However, some individuals are quite adept at controlling their eye contact to appear sincere, so this behavior alone doesn’t guarantee truthfulness.

On the other hand, the subtle shaking of the head caught my attention. Head shaking typically signals disagreement or negation, which can be a nonverbal indicator of discomfort or denial when paired with certain statements. In the context of someone possibly lying, this micro-gesture might unconsciously betray their internal conflict or hesitation. That said, head shaking can also be a natural emphatic gesture, used earnestly to stress a point. Without hearing the specific content or tone, it's a bit tricky to interpret definitively.

Balancing these observations, the consistent gaze suggests a conscious attempt to appear honest, while the head shaking hints at possible internal resistance or doubt. Given these somewhat contradictory signals, the behavior leans slightly towards sincerity, aligning with the scenario that the person is telling the truth. It's not a slam dunk, but the nuance in their nonverbal cues makes it reasonable to conclude they are likely being honest.

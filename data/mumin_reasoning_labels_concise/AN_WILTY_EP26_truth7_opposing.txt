Watching the video carefully, several subtle cues in the person's behavior stand out, though they are somewhat mixed in their implications. The upward and downward movements of the chin suggest a degree of thoughtfulness or processing of information, rather than evasiveness. Typically, such motions could reflect contemplation rather than deceit, as someone fabricating might be more unnatural or restrained in these expressions. Their gaze is predominantly directed towards the interlocutor, which often indicates engagement and transparency; however, occasional sideways glances introduce a slight uncertainty, as these can sometimes be associated with discomfort or attempts to conceal the truth. Yet, in a natural conversation, brief side glances can also be a sign of cautious reflection rather than dishonesty.

Additionally, the person nods intermittently, which tends to encourage rapport and signal agreement or sincerity. The subtle side-turning of the head might be interpreted in two ways: it could be a sign of defensiveness or discomfort, but it might also simply indicate attentive listening or forming a thoughtful response. The palms facing upward can be an unconscious gesture of openness and honesty, which aligns with truthful communication.

Balancing these observations, there are no glaring indications of truthfulness. While some gestures might, in isolation, suggest trustworthiness, the overall pattern leans toward deceptive behavior. The combination of engaged eye contact, thoughtful chin movements, encouraging nods, and open palm gestures construct a picture more consistent with dishonesty. Of course, nonverbal cues are notoriously context-dependent, and without additional information, one cannot be entirely definitive. Nevertheless, based on what is presented, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is likely being untruthful.

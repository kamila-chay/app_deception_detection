Watching the video, the person displays certain subtle behaviors that caught my attention. They raise their eyebrows at moments when you might expect a more neutral or controlled facial expression. This kind of micro-expression can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, though it could also be a sign of underlying discomfort. Additionally, their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor fairly consistently, which might normally be interpreted as engagement and sincerity. However, maintaining steady eye contact can also be a conscious effort to appear truthful, especially if someone is trying to convince or mask deception.

On the other hand, it's worth considering that these behaviors—raised eyebrows and sustained gaze—are not definitive indicators of lying on their own. People often vary in their natural expressiveness and eye contact habits, and cultural or personality differences might explain these cues without implying deceit.

Still, when taking the combination of these subtle expressions together and comparing them with typical behavioral patterns, it leans more toward an attempt to appear convincing rather than genuine openness. The raised eyebrows seem slightly forced, appearing at moments that don’t quite align with the natural flow of conversation, and the sustained gaze might be a deliberate control rather than spontaneous interaction.

Taking all this into account, while it's impossible to be absolutely certain without additional context, the behavior exhibited suggests a higher likelihood that the person is not fully truthful in this instance. The balance of evidence points to a well-masked lie rather than candid honesty.

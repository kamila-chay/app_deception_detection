Watching the video, there are several behavioral cues that stand out, though none are definitive on their own. The person intermittently raises their eyebrows and retracts their lips, which can sometimes signal discomfort or an attempt to control emotional expression. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways, which might suggest a mix of engagement and avoidance—potentially indicating cognitive load or unease. Additionally, the subtle side-turning of the head could be an involuntary gesture to distance themselves from the topic or convey hesitation.

Considering these observations together, there seems to be a pattern consistent with someone who is likely being truthful. However, it’s important to acknowledge that such behaviors can also occur naturally in anxious or stressed individuals, not necessarily liars. The person’s gaze shifts could simply reflect normal processing rather than deceit. Nonetheless, weighing the combination of raised eyebrows, lip retraction, gaze shifts, and head movements, it appears more likely than not that the person is being honest in this context. While these signs are not conclusive, they strongly suggest an underlying discomfort that aligns with truthful behavior.

Observing the individual's behavior in the video, there are several subtle cues that warrant consideration when trying to determine the veracity of their statements. The person raises their eyebrows occasionally, which can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize a point. Their gaze remains directed toward the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and perhaps an effort to maintain connection or persuasion. Additionally, the person nods and shrugs at certain moments, gestures that can express agreement or uncertainty, respectively.

At first glance, these behaviors might suggest openness and responsiveness, which one might associate with honesty. The direct gaze, in particular, often signals truthfulness, since people who lie sometimes avoid eye contact to conceal deception. However, it’s also worth noting that confident liars can maintain eye contact purposefully to appear credible. Raising eyebrows can serve as a subtle appeal for trust or emphasize elements of their story, while nodding may be a tactic to encourage agreement from the listener. The shrug, in this context, might be a way of deflecting responsibility or signaling ambiguity, which could hint at evasion.

Balancing these observations, I lean toward the assessment that the individual is not being fully truthful. While their behaviors are not overtly suspicious, the combination of eyebrow raises and the juxtaposition of nodding with occasional shrugging creates an uneasy mix of assertion and hesitance. This blend could reflect an attempt to convince while simultaneously revealing underlying uncertainty. Admittedly, these signs are not definitive proof of deception, and a more comprehensive analysis including verbal content and context would strengthen the conclusion. Still, based on the nonverbal cues alone, my educated guess is that the person is likely lying.

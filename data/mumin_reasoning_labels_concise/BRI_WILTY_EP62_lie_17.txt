Watching the individual’s behavior closely, there are a few subtle cues that suggest some internal discomfort or nervousness. The person exhibits frequent blinking, which can sometimes indicate stress or an attempt to mask anxiety, though it can also occur naturally or as a response to lighting conditions. Additionally, the crossing of fingers is a notable gesture; while it might be dismissed by some as a common, harmless habit, it is often associated with hoping to avoid bad outcomes or as a subconscious attempt to deceive.

Considering these behaviors together, it seems plausible that the person may not be fully truthful. Frequent blinking coupled with crossed fingers could point towards an effort to conceal something or a lack of confidence in the statements being made. However, it’s worth noting that body language isn't foolproof—someone could simply be nervous or uncomfortable for reasons unrelated to deception. Still, balancing these interpretations, the evidence slightly leans toward the person not being entirely honest in this instance.

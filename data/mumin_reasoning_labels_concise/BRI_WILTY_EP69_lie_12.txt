Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting signals that could suggest deception, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. For instance, their eyebrows rise at moments that seem inconsistent with the flow of the conversation, which might indicate an attempt to feign surprise or conceal nervousness. The shifts in their gaze are also noteworthy—they maintain eye contact at times but then glance sideways unexpectedly. This pattern could reflect an internal conflict between wanting to appear honest and feeling uneasy about what they’re saying.

On the other hand, such behaviors by themselves don’t guarantee lying. People often raise their eyebrows to emphasize a point or show engagement, and varying gaze directions can sometimes be just natural thought processes rather than signs of deceit. Still, when these cues come together—especially eyebrow raises paired with inconsistent eye movements—it tends to raise a red flag.

Given the combination of subtle facial expressions and eye behavior, it seems more likely that the person is not being entirely truthful. While it’s possible these actions are just quirks of their communication style, the overall impression leans toward deception. It’s a judgment made with some caution, but the nonverbal signals certainly align with patterns commonly seen in dishonesty.

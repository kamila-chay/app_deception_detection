Observing the person's behavior in the video, several subtle yet telling cues suggest they may not be entirely truthful. Their chin movements—alternating between moving upwards and downwards—could indicate an internal struggle, perhaps reflecting attempts to assert confidence while simultaneously grappling with discomfort. The gaze patterns add another layer of complexity: while there are moments of direct eye contact with the interlocutor, these are interspersed with glances downward, which can sometimes signal evasion or uncertainty.

The head movements also warrant attention. Moving the head forward and backward might indicate a push-and-pull dynamic in their communication, as if they're trying to engage but also subtly withdraw, possibly to create distance from the truth. This is complemented by head tilting and side-turning, which can be interpreted as signs of defensiveness or hesitation. Lastly, the use of palms up gestures is interesting; such open-handed motions can be attempts to appear sincere and honest.

While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove deception—they could stem from nervousness or other factors—the combination creates a pattern that leans toward the person being dishonest. It’s important to acknowledge that some truthful individuals might exhibit similar signs under stress, but here, the interplay of these cues makes the interpretation that they’re lying more plausible. Overall, the nonverbal signals, when considered together, support an educated guess that the person is not being fully truthful in the video.

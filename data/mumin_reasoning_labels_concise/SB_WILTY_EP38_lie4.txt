Observing the person's behavior in the video, several subtle cues suggest a level of discomfort or hesitation that might indicate deception. The frequent raising of eyebrows, combined with occasional downward movement of the chin, could be signs of uncertainty or an attempt to mask true feelings. At the same time, the shifts in gaze—from direct eye contact to looking sideways—might reflect a struggle to maintain a believable narrative, as people often find it difficult to sustain steady eye contact when being untruthful.

The nodding and movements of the head, including tilting backwards and turning to the side, might represent conflicting attempts to appear convincing while also physically distancing themselves from the topic or the interlocutor, which can be a subconscious distancing mechanism. Additionally, the folding of the arms could denote a defensive posture, further hinting at internal unease.

On the other hand, one could argue that some of these behaviors, like nodding and gaze towards the interlocutor, might signal engagement or active listening rather than deceit. People often exhibit nervous habits without intending to deceive, and body language alone isn't a definitive marker of lying.

However, considering the combination and timing of these behaviors together, the pattern leans more towards someone who is likely not being entirely truthful. The mixture of defensive postures with incongruent facial and gaze patterns suggests a level of incongruity that is hard to maintain in honest interactions. While it’s not absolutely certain, the evidence points toward the conclusion that the person is probably lying.

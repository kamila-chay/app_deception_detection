Watching the person in the video, I notice a sense of naturalness in their demeanor that generally aligns with someone being truthful. Their facial expressions seem consistent with the emotions one might expect from the context, and there aren't obvious signs of hesitation or discomfort that often accompany deceptive behavior. The flow of their speech appears steady, without prolonged pauses or attempts to avoid direct answers.

That said, assessing truthfulness solely from behavior can be challenging. Some truthful individuals may display nervousness or fidgeting simply because they are under scrutiny, not because they are lying. Conversely, skilled liars can sometimes mask their deceit convincingly. Without additional behavioral markers or a list of specific behaviors, my interpretation remains cautious.

Balancing these considerations, my best estimation based on what I observe is that the person is likely being deceptive. While their overall composure and lack of contradictory nonverbal cues might suggest truthfulness, I acknowledge that without further evidence, some uncertainty remains.

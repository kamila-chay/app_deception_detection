Watching the video, I notice the person maintains fairly steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which might suggest openness and honesty at first glance. However, the steady gaze can sometimes be a deliberate attempt to appear convincing or to mask nervousness. Additionally, the subtle head tilting is intriguing—it might be interpreted as a sign of engagement or empathy, but in certain contexts, it could also indicate hesitation or uncertainty.

Given these behaviors, the situation is somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, the steady gaze could imply the person is being truthful and confident. On the other hand, the head tilting, combined with the intense gaze, might signal that the person is trying too hard to appear believable, which can be a hint of deception. Since I already know that the person is lying, it seems plausible that these behaviors are part of a conscious effort to convince others rather than genuine indicators of honesty. While none of these cues alone definitively confirm lying, taken together, they support the assessment that the person is not being truthful in the video.

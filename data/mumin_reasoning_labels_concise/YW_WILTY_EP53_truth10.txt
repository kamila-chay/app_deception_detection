Watching the video closely, the person’s behavior offers some interesting clues about their truthfulness. Their gaze frequently shifts between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways. While maintaining eye contact can suggest honesty, occasional sideways glances might imply some level of discomfort or thought processing. However, this doesn't necessarily mean deception; it can also indicate that the person is carefully considering their words or recalling details, which aligns with someone being truthful.

The individual also raises their eyebrows at times, a gesture often associated with surprise or emphasis, which could signal genuine engagement with the topic rather than rehearsed statements. Additionally, the frequent blinking might be interpreted in various ways—some might see it as a sign of nervousness, but it might just as well be a natural response to the situation or lighting conditions during the video recording.

Another subtle yet telling behavior is the forward movement of the head. Leaning forward can be a sign of interest and sincerity, as if the person is eager to communicate their message clearly. This gesture tends to support the notion that the person is not trying to hide anything but rather is engaged and earnest in the conversation.

Weighing these behaviors together, there are some mixed signals at first glance, particularly the side glances and increased blinking, which could raise doubts. However, considering the overall demeanor—especially the attentive gaze, expressive eyebrows, and forward-leaning posture—it seems more consistent with someone who is telling the truth. Of course, no single set of behaviors is definitive, but based on this combination, my best assessment is that the person is being truthful.

Watching the video closely, several behaviors stand out that seem to suggest the person is being deceptive. Their lip corners are slightly upturned, which can be a subtle indicator of forced smiles often linked to deceit rather than genuine engagement or positive affect. The sustained gaze towards the interlocutor also raises suspicion; maintaining eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to appear open and confident, whereas frequent avoidance might hint at discomfort or evasion.

That said, the occasional sideways gaze and nod could be interpreted in different ways. A gaze away from the interlocutor might sometimes signal internal processing or momentary uncertainty, but it can also be a natural part of thoughtful conversation rather than a sign of honesty. Nodding in response tends to support agreement or understanding, which aligns well with truthful communication, though it could also be a social tactic to appear agreeable.

Taking all these behaviors into account, the balance of evidence leans towards deception. While no single behavior guarantees dishonesty, the combination of subtle forced smiles, consistent eye contact that may be deliberate, and affirmative gestures creates a picture that fits well with someone who is not telling the truth. Of course, one must always consider context and individual differences, but based on these cues, the educated guess would be that the person is lying.

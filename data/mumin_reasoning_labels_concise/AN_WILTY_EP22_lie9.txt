Watching the video, the person maintains steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which might initially suggest openness or confidence. Generally, sustained gaze can be a sign of honesty, as liars sometimes avoid direct eye contact to conceal their deceit. However, this is not always a definitive indicator, since some people are quite skilled at maintaining eye contact even when being untruthful. 

What caught my attention more was the subtle head shaking. This gesture often communicates disagreement or uncertainty, and in the context of a conversation where someone might be expected to affirm something, it can be a telltale sign of internal conflict or discomfort. While head shaking alone isn’t proof of lying, when paired with the intensity of gaze, it creates some cognitive dissonance—if a person is truly confident and truthful, their body language generally aligns better across these cues.

Taking these observations together, it seems plausible that the person is attempting to convey truthfulness through their steady gaze, but the involuntary head shaking hints at concealed doubt or discomfort. This combination suggests that they may not be fully honest in their statements, even if they appear otherwise on the surface. While I can’t be completely certain without more context, the mismatch between these signals leads me to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely lying.

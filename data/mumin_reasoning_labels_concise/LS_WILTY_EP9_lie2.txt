Observing the person's behavior in the video, several cues suggest a complex emotional state that could be indicative of deception, though it's important to consider alternative explanations. The individual displays a smile and raises their eyebrows, which might initially be interpreted as signs of openness or friendliness. However, these expressions can also serve as social masks or attempts to mask discomfort when someone is not being truthful. The frequent blinking observed may signal stress or cognitive load, which often accompanies lying as the person mentally constructs or maintains their untruth. 

Additionally, the subtle lift of the lip corners combined with sustained gaze towards the interlocutor could be efforts to maintain rapport and project confidence. Yet, these behaviors can sometimes be overcompensations when someone feels uneasy about their honesty. The self-touching gestures, such as hands touching the head or body, generally point towards nervousness or self-soothing, which aligns with the strain of deception. Meanwhile, open arms could suggest an attempt to appear transparent and trustworthy, potentially masking underlying tension.

While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove dishonesty, the combination of them, especially the mix of reassuring gestures and signs of stress, leans towards the person not being entirely truthful. It’s conceivable that some of these actions stem from nervousness unrelated to lying, like social anxiety or discomfort in front of the camera, but when taken together, the pattern feels consistent with deception. Therefore, my assessment, based on the behavioral cues presented, is that the person is likely lying, though this conclusion is made with some reservations given the complexity of interpreting nonverbal signals.

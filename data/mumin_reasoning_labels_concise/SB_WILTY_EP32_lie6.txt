Watching the video, there are a few subtle cues in the person's behavior that suggest some level of discomfort or hesitation, which might indicate they are not being entirely truthful. Their gaze shifts several times, sometimes meeting the interlocutor's eyes, then quickly looking downward or sideways. This variation in gaze could reflect an internal struggle to maintain a plausible story while avoiding direct scrutiny. The occasional head tilting might be a sign of uncertainty or an attempt to buy time while constructing a response. Interestingly, their arms are open at moments, which might be an effort to appear open and honest, yet this could also be a conscious attempt to offset the more telling signs of evasiveness.

That said, none of these behaviors alone conclusively prove deceit; people can exhibit such patterns for many reasons, like nervousness or discomfort unrelated to lying. However, when considering the combination of shifting gaze, head movements, and the somewhat guarded posture despite open arms, the balance of evidence leans towards them not being entirely truthful in this instance. It feels like a carefully managed performance where the person is trying to appear sincere, but the subtle nonverbal signals betray a different story. So, while there's room for doubt, the overall impression is that the individual is likely lying.

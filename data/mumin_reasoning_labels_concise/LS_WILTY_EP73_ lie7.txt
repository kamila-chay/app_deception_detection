Watching the video, there are several behavioral cues that suggest the person might not be telling the truth. The raised eyebrows, combined with a slight, possibly forced smile—indicated by the lip corners turning up—often signal an attempt to appear more open or agreeable than they truly feel. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which can sometimes reflect an effort to maintain control or convince the other person of their sincerity. Interestingly, the head shaking is somewhat contradictory; typically, shaking the head implies negation or disagreement, which doesn’t align neatly with the other signs of engagement. 

One could argue that these behaviors might simply reflect nervousness or discomfort rather than deceit. For example, head shaking might be a habitual gesture or a way to manage anxiety. Likewise, the smile and gaze could be attempts at politeness or connection. However, when considered together, this cluster of expressions—especially the combination of raised eyebrows and inconsistent head gestures—leans more toward a person who is trying to mask their true feelings or intentions. While it's possible they are merely uneasy or conflicted, the subtle incongruities in their nonverbal communication make it more plausible that they are being less than truthful.

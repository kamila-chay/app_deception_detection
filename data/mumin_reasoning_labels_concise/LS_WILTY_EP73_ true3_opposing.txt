Watching the video, I notice that the individual exhibits a pattern of gaze shifts—alternating between looking up and down throughout their speech. Such eye movements can often be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. For instance, looking up is sometimes associated with recalling visual memories, while looking down might suggest accessing internal feelings or processing information. These shifts could indicate that the person is thoughtfully considering their responses rather than fabricating information on the spot.

Of course, one might argue that frequent gaze changes can also be signs of discomfort or evasion, potentially hinting at deception. However, I don’t detect any consistent avoidance or signs of nervousness that typically accompany lying. Instead, the gaze behavior seems more indicative of genuine cognitive engagement. Given these observations, and weighing both interpretations, my assessment leans toward the individual being truthful, though I remain mindful that eye movement alone isn’t definitive proof in itself.

Watching the video, the person’s behavior strikes me as somewhat inconsistent, which makes me lean toward the possibility that they’re not being entirely truthful. Their laughter and the raised eyebrows might initially suggest a lighthearted or open attitude, but when combined with exaggerated eye closing and the somewhat forced smile indicated by the upturned lip corners, it feels more like an affectation than genuine emotion. The subtle, frequent movements of the chin—both upwards and downwards—along with shifts in gaze from directly at the interlocutor to sideways, often signal discomfort or an attempt to mask true feelings.

On the other hand, certain body language cues such as nodding and leaning the head forward typically promote engagement and listening, which could be perceived as signs of sincerity. However, the presence of hands touching the head or body, or the occasional scratching, suggests some underlying tension or self-soothing behavior, which is commonly associated with stress or deception.

Putting all these together, while none of these behaviors individually confirm lying, the combination of conflicting facial expressions, gaze aversion, and subtle self-comforting actions collectively point toward an attempt to conceal the truth. That said, without additional context, it remains an interpretation rather than a certainty, but based on these cues, I would cautiously estimate that the person is likely not being truthful.

Observing the individual's behavior in the video, it seems that their gaze is consistently directed towards the person they are speaking with. This sustained eye contact typically suggests engagement and openness, which are often interpreted as signs of honesty. People who are lying might avoid prolonged eye contact due to discomfort or fear of being caught. However, it’s worth considering that some individuals can maintain strong eye contact precisely to appear truthful, which adds a layer of ambiguity.

On the other hand, genuine eye contact doesn’t guarantee truthfulness on its own. Cultural factors and personal habits also influence how people use gaze during conversations, so relying solely on this behavior could be misleading. But given the steady and natural manner in which the person looks toward their interlocutor, it leans more towards indicating sincerity rather than deceit.

Taking all this into account, while there's always room to doubt based on a single behavioral cue, the evidence points toward the person likely telling the truth in this situation.

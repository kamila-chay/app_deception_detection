Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests a degree of discomfort or cognitive strain, which can occur even when someone is being truthful, though it’s not definitive on its own. The frequent blinking and raising of eyebrows could indicate a heightened level of nervousness or an attempt to process information quickly while formulating an honest response. At the same time, the downward pull at the corners of the lips and the subtle upward movement of the chin may signal suppressed negative emotions or an effort to maintain control over their expression. Interestingly, the person’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor and slight head tilting might be interpreted as signs of engagement or an attempt to establish trust, which could be a genuine effort to communicate honestly.

On the other hand, these behaviors might also stem from genuine anxiety or uncertainty, especially in a high-stakes or emotional situation, rather than intentional lying. The head positioned upwards could reflect confidence or simply an attempt to maintain composure, which complicates a straightforward assessment. However, balancing these factors, the combination of micro-expressions—particularly those associated with tension around the lips and increased blinking—leans more toward the likelihood that the individual is being truthful. While it’s important to acknowledge that none of these cues alone prove veracity, the interplay of these subtle signals supports the educated guess that the person is probably telling the truth in this context.

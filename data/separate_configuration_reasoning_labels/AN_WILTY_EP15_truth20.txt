The individual consistently maintains their gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, steady eye contact might suggest honesty and confidence, as a truthful person often seeks to establish trust and demonstrate openness through direct engagement. This behavior could indicate that the subject is forthcoming and comfortable with the conversation. On the other hand, unwavering gaze might also be a strategic effort to conceal deception; some individuals maintain intense eye contact deliberately to seem sincere and avoid suspicion, knowing that averting gaze is commonly associated with dishonesty. Therefore, what appears as genuine attentiveness could, in certain cases, mask underlying discomfort or the cognitive effort involved in fabricating information. Without further behavioral cues or contextual information, it remains difficult to definitively associate this gaze pattern with either truthfulness or deceit.

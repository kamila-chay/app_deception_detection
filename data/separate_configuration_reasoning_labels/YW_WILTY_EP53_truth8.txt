The subject’s lip corners are down, which can be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or sadness, potentially stemming from the stress of fabricating information. Conversely, this expression might simply reflect genuine emotional distress or concern unrelated to deception. Their lips appear retracted, a behavior that might indicate tension or the effort to suppress truthful responses, suggesting possible dishonesty. On the other hand, lip retraction could also occur naturally during moments of concentration or when carefully choosing one’s words, without any intent to deceive. The downward movement of the chin may signal submission or an attempt to avoid confrontation, perhaps as a subtle cue of withholding information. Alternatively, this gesture could be a natural posture reflecting thoughtfulness or modesty, devoid of deceptive intent. The subject’s gaze shows a mix of looking towards the interlocutor and glancing down. Direct eye contact might be interpreted as a confidence strategy to assert truthfulness, but it can equally be a rehearsed behavior intended to convince others while fabricating details. Meanwhile, occasional downward gaze could suggest discomfort or shame associated with deceit, yet it may also indicate the cognitive process of recalling memories or managing emotions. Without considering the broader context in which these behaviors occur, it is difficult to definitively assess their meaning, as each action holds potential for both truthful and deceptive interpretations.

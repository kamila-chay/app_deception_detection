The subject’s slight lifting of the lip corners could suggest a genuine moment of amusement or confidence, which might align with truthful communication. Conversely, this subtle smile might be a controlled effort to mask discomfort or to put the observer at ease, possibly indicating deception. Their shifting gaze—alternating between looking upward and downward—can also be interpreted in multiple ways; looking up might reflect an attempt to access visual memory and sincerely recall details, while the downward gaze could signify introspection or momentary uncertainty. On the other hand, these gaze movements might be strategic, designed to avoid direct eye contact and to fabricate elements of a story. The open positioning of the arms generally conveys openness and a lack of defensiveness, possibly reinforcing a candid and honest demeanor. Yet, this same gesture could also be intentionally employed to project confidence and disarm suspicion, serving as a deliberate social signal rather than a true indicator of honesty. Ultimately, these behaviors alone do not provide conclusive evidence; contextual cues and additional information are essential to differentiate between genuine truthfulness and potential deception.

The individual maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest openness and confidence, often associated with truthful communication, as the person appears engaged and willing to be transparent. Conversely, such gaze could also be deliberately maintained to mask deceit, as some individuals consciously use direct eye contact to project sincerity and deflect suspicion. Moreover, cultural or personal communication styles may influence eye contact patterns, meaning that what appears as truthful engagement in one scenario might be a rehearsed behavior in another. Without additional cues or context, this gaze behavior alone does not conclusively indicate veracity or deception, but rather highlights the complexity of interpreting nonverbal signals in human communication.

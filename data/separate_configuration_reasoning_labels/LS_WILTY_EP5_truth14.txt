The individual’s facial expressions, such as frowning eyebrows coupled with raised eyebrows and exaggerated eye opening, present a complex picture. These movements might suggest an attempt to emphasize surprise or disbelief, potentially aligning with deceptive behavior where the person could be overacting to convince the interlocutor. Conversely, these same expressions might genuinely reflect confusion or heightened emotional engagement in the conversation, indicating truthfulness. The downturn of the lip corners may be interpreted as a sign of distress or discomfort, which some might link to the anxiety of fabricating information. However, it could equally be a natural reaction to the topic being discussed, revealing sincere sadness or concern rather than deceit.

Their gaze behavior adds further ambiguity. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor could imply confidence and openness, traits commonly associated with honesty. Yet, it might also serve as a calculated effort to appear trustworthy, compensating for underlying deceit. Conversely, looking down might be perceived as evasiveness or guilt, classic indicators of dishonesty. On the other hand, downward gaze can simply signal thoughtfulness or the need to process complex information, without any deceptive intent. Finally, the presence of nodding gestures could be a sign of agreement and engagement, which generally supports truthful communication. However, nodding might also be employed strategically to create a sense of rapport or acquiescence, potentially masking deceptive motives.

In sum, the behaviors exhibited could support interpretations of both honesty and deception. Without a broader understanding of the context, including baseline behavior and the content of the dialogue, it is difficult to conclusively attribute these signals to either truthfulness or deceit.

The individual exhibits frequent blinking, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, increased blinking might reflect cognitive effort or stress, often associated with attempting to conceal information or fabricate a response. Conversely, it could simply be a physiological response to environmental factors like dryness or lighting, or a natural nervous tic unrelated to deception. Their lips are protruded, a behavior sometimes linked to discomfort or uncertainty, potentially signaling an attempt to withhold or manipulate information. However, lip protrusion might also be an unconscious expression of thoughtfulness or concentration, without any deceptive intent. The upward movement of the chin may suggest defiance or confidence, which could be a deliberate strategy to assert credibility during deception. Alternatively, this head posture could be a habitual gesture or a sign of the individual's personality traits, independent of truthfulness. The person’s gaze is directed sideways rather than straight ahead; while sideways glances can indicate evasiveness or an effort to disengage from direct communication—a common feature in deceptive behavior—they can equally represent moments of reflection, distraction, or even cultural norms regarding eye contact. Similarly, the turning of the head to the side can be seen as a subtle avoidance tactic to distance oneself from a challenging question or uncomfortable topic, yet it might also be simply a natural inclination or a way to better hear or focus on the interlocutor’s voice. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires a broader understanding of the context, baseline behaviors, and additional verbal or nonverbal cues to draw a more informed conclusion about the subject’s veracity.

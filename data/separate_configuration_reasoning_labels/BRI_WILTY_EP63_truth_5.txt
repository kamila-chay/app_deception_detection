The subject’s palms being visible and facing upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, showing open palms is often associated with honesty and openness, suggesting that the person is being genuine and transparent in their communication. It can signal a willingness to share information and a lack of intention to hide anything, thereby supporting the idea that they are truthful. Conversely, this same gesture might be employed strategically to create an impression of sincerity and innocence, which could be a conscious or subconscious attempt to mask deceit. In some cases, palms-up gestures are used to pacify or appeal to the listener, potentially diverting attention from inconsistencies or falsehoods. Ultimately, assessing this behavior demands careful consideration of the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behaviors, and situational cues, to discern whether the palms-up gesture aligns more convincingly with honesty or deception.

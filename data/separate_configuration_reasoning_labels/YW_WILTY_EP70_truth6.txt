The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signal surprise or emphasis, potentially reflecting genuine reactions and openness in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a deliberate social cue to feign sincerity or to exaggerate emotions artificially, possibly indicating an attempt to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor similarly holds dual meanings; sustained eye contact is often associated with honesty and engagement, yet it can just as easily be a conscious effort to convince or distract, especially if the individual is aware of being scrutinized.

When the subject’s gaze shifts upwards, this action might imply thoughtful reflection or trying to access memory, suggesting they are being truthful and attempting to recall accurate information. However, the upward gaze can also be interpreted within a framework of deception as a sign of constructing or fabricating a response. The act of nodding while speaking generally encourages communication and can indicate agreement or affirmation, reinforcing the impression of honesty. On the other hand, nodding might be a strategic behavior used to create rapport or to falsely signal confidence in what is being said, possibly masking uncertainty or deceit.

Lastly, the subject’s posture with their head held up may convey confidence and openness, traits often associated with truthfulness. Nevertheless, this posture can also represent a controlled or rehearsed demeanor designed to project credibility and deflect suspicion. Each of these behaviors, therefore, requires careful consideration within the broader context of the interaction, including verbal cues and situational factors, before drawing a conclusion about the subject’s truthfulness or potential deception.

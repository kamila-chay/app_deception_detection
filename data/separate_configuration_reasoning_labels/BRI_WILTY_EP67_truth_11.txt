The individual’s pattern of gaze shifts offers a complex portrait that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might indicate confidence and honesty, suggesting openness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere or to assert control, masking underlying deceit. When their gaze shifts upward, this may be a sign of cognitive processing, reflecting genuine efforts to recall information or to articulate thoughts carefully. However, the same upward glance can sometimes be associated with constructing or fabricating details, hinting at possible dishonesty. The moments when their gaze drops downward might suggest feelings of guilt, discomfort, or shame, which can point toward conveying falsehoods. Yet, looking down can equally be a natural response to introspection or modesty, bearing no relation to deception. Finally, sideways glances can be interpreted as evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation, possibly signaling deception. Alternatively, these glances might simply reflect social anxiety, distraction, or the internal navigation of memories. Given these contrasting interpretations, assessing the truthfulness of the individual requires careful consideration of the wider behavioral and situational context before drawing any definitive conclusions.

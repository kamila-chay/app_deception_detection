The person’s frowning eyebrows might suggest discomfort or concentration, which could be interpreted as a sign of unease typically associated with deception. However, frowning can also simply reflect genuine effort to process information or emotional reactions unrelated to dishonesty. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor could imply confidence and openness, often indicative of truthfulness, but it might also be a conscious attempt to appear sincere while hiding something. Conversely, the occasional sideways glance might reveal evasiveness or internal conflict, hinting at the possibility of deception, though it could equally be a natural response when trying to recall details or deal with distractions. The head tilting adds another layer of ambiguity—it might indicate curiosity or engagement, supporting the idea of honesty, yet it could also be a subtle sign of discomfort or a strategy to mask deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context, and relying solely on them without considering additional cues would limit the accuracy of any judgment regarding truthfulness.

The subject’s smile and laughter, along with the upward movement of their lip corners, could be interpreted in multiple ways. These expressions might reflect genuine enjoyment and openness, suggesting a truthful and relaxed demeanor. Conversely, such behaviors could be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to project an image of sincerity, which might indicate an attempt to deceive. Their chin moving upwards, coupled with the head held high, could signal confidence and assurance, reinforcing the possibility of honesty. However, this posture might also be a form of controlled body language intended to assert dominance or deflect suspicion, thus potentially hinting at deception.

Their gaze behavior presents a similarly ambiguous picture. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor is often seen as a sign of engagement and credibility, supporting the interpretation of truthfulness. Yet, sustained eye contact can also be deliberately maintained to manipulate perceptions or to overcompensate for dishonesty. Meanwhile, moments when the gaze shifts upward might indicate the subject is accessing internal thoughts or memories, which could be consistent with recalling truthful information. On the other hand, such gaze aversions or shifts can also be associated with cognitive load and the construction of fabricated details. Ultimately, without additional contextual clues, these behaviors remain open to interpretation, underscoring the complexity of accurately discerning deception based solely on visible cues.

The subject's behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, suggesting a truthful response. Conversely, eyebrow raising could also be a deliberate effort to appear more convincing or to mask underlying deception by exaggerating emotional expressions. Their closed mouth could indicate restraint, possibly reflecting a desire to control what is said, which might be consistent with concealing information. Alternatively, a closed mouth may simply reflect concentration or the natural posture during a serious conversation without implying dishonesty.

The retraction of the lips presents another ambiguous cue. This could indicate tension or discomfort, potentially signaling that the person is withholding truth or experiencing stress related to deception. Yet, lip retraction might also be a neutral expression related to the person's habitual facial movements or a response to external stimuli such as lighting or temperature. Movements of the chin, both upwards and downwards, add further complexity. A chin raised might be interpreted as a sign of defensiveness or an attempt to assert confidence in a fabricated narrative, while it could equally convey determination or engagement in the conversation. Conversely, a downward chin movement might reflect submission or uncertainty, potentially revealing guilt or hesitation, but it could also represent modesty or deep thought unrelated to deceit.

The subject’s gaze directed downward is often highlighted as a classic indicator of evasiveness or discomfort tied to deception. Yet, in many contexts, looking down can simply be a natural response to recalling information, internal contemplation, or feelings of shyness, without any implication of lying. Nodding can signal agreement and willingness to communicate truthfully, but it can also be a strategic behavior used to encourage the interlocutor to continue speaking, possibly as part of a fabricated story. Similarly, head tilting may suggest curiosity or engagement, reinforcing credibility. However, it might also be a self-soothing gesture reflecting insecurity, which could be associated with deceptive behavior.

Taken as a whole, these behaviors do not conclusively point towards either truthfulness or deception in isolation. Each gesture can be indicative of multiple psychological states depending on the broader conversational context, the individual's baseline mannerisms, and cultural factors. Only by integrating these subtle cues with additional information can a more accurate assessment be made.

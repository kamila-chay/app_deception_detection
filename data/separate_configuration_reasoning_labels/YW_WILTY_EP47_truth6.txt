The individual’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of truthfulness or deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating a genuine reaction to the question or topic at hand. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate attempt to convey sincerity or innocence, a gesture sometimes consciously employed by those attempting to persuade or distract from withholding information. Their steady gaze towards the interlocutor similarly presents dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact might suggest openness and confidence consistent with honesty, yet it can also be a controlled tactic to avoid detection, reflecting a rehearsed effort to appear credible. The action of showing palms upwards is traditionally associated with openness and honesty, implying a non-threatening and sincere demeanor. However, this gesture might be deliberately exaggerated to project trustworthiness or to soften the impact of a deceptive narrative. Ultimately, these behaviors, while informative, are ambiguous when isolated and require additional contextual cues and baseline observations to accurately discern the individual’s truthfulness or deception.

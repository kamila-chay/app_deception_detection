The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact may suggest honesty and confidence, reflecting a willingness to engage openly and transparently. Conversely, intentional gaze can also be a tactic to convince or manipulate, as some individuals maintain strong eye contact to appear more credible while potentially concealing the truth. Similarly, the act of nodding during conversation often signals agreement or understanding, reinforcing a sense of sincerity and cooperation. However, it could also be a strategic behavior designed to feign attentiveness or compliance, aimed at persuading the interlocutor of one’s reliability. The forward movement of the head might be perceived as an expression of engagement and eagerness to participate authentically in the exchange, which supports the notion of truthful communication. Yet, this gesture could alternatively be read as an attempt to assert dominance or control the direction of the conversation, possibly masking underlying discomfort or evasion. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues—such as verbal consistency, baseline behavioral patterns, or situational factors—these visible behaviors alone cannot definitively indicate deception or honesty, underscoring the importance of comprehensive analysis before drawing conclusions.

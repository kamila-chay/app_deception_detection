The individual’s smile and raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, these expressions might suggest genuine engagement and openness, as smiles and eyebrow raises often signify positive emotion or surprise in honest communication. Conversely, such facial cues can also be strategically employed to mask true feelings, serving as attempts to appear more trustworthy or to deflect suspicion. The subtle upward movement of the lip corners and retracted lips may reinforce either interpretation; they could indicate authentic warmth or enthusiasm, or alternatively, they may be controlled motions meant to simulate sincerity while concealing deceit.

Their gaze behavior adds further complexity. Looking directly at the interlocutor often signifies confidence and transparency, potentially supporting the impression of truthfulness. Yet, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate tactic to manipulate perception, as some deceivers consciously maintain gaze to avoid appearing evasive. The occasional downward gaze might reflect introspection or discomfort, signaling a struggle with recalling information honestly, but it may equally stem from social norms or momentary thoughtfulness unrelated to deceit.

The person’s head movements—turning sideways and shaking—introduce additional ambiguity. A head turn could be a natural response to emphasize a point or to engage with surroundings, suggesting openness. However, it might also function as an avoidance behavior, subtly redirecting attention to evade scrutiny. Similarly, head shaking often denotes disagreement or disbelief, but in this context, it might either underscore sincerity by rejecting false allegations or serve as a nonverbal cue to distance oneself from uncomfortable truths.

Given these behaviors, the interpretation hinges greatly on the broader context, including baseline behavioral patterns, the content of the conversation, and extraverbal cues. Without such information, these visible actions could just as plausibly reflect genuine truth-telling as they could represent nuanced attempts at deception.

The person’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest honesty and confidence, as individuals who are truthful often find it comfortable to engage directly and openly with others. This behavior could reflect a sincere effort to connect and communicate transparently, reinforcing the perception of credibility. On the other hand, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit. Some individuals who are attempting to fabricate information might hold their gaze to avoid suspicion, consciously trying to appear more trustworthy and engaged. This controlled behavior might be a tactic to overcompensate for underlying nervousness or dishonesty. Ultimately, the significance of the gaze depends heavily on the broader context, including the person's baseline behavior, the nature of the interaction, and additional nonverbal cues, all of which are crucial to forming a balanced and accurate judgment about their truthfulness.

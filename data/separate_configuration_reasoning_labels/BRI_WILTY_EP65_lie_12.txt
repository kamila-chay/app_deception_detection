The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest honesty and confidence, as people who are truthful often feel comfortable engaging openly with others and sustaining direct visual interaction. It could indicate that the person is genuinely engaged in the conversation and has no reason to avoid scrutiny. On the other hand, sustained gaze can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to appear credible and trustworthy while fabricating information. It might also serve to intimidate or distract the listener, drawing attention away from inconsistencies in their story. Moreover, cultural and individual differences in eye contact behavior can heavily influence the meaning of this gesture, further complicating its interpretation. Without additional context—such as baseline behavior, verbal cues, or physiological signs—the observed gaze cannot conclusively indicate truthfulness or deception, emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach in assessing veracity.

The subject’s chin moving downwards could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might suggest a moment of introspection or discomfort, potentially indicating they are grappling with the truth or experiencing hesitation linked to deception. Conversely, this gesture could simply reflect a natural response to listening attentively or processing information, with no deceptive intent. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor generally signals engagement and openness, which is often associated with honest communication. However, the presence of sideways glances introduces complexity; such glances might imply evasiveness or attempts to avoid direct eye contact when fabricating details. Yet, they could equally represent genuine cognitive effort in recalling memories or evaluating the conversation.

Similarly, the movements of the head—forward, backward, and side-turns—demonstrate a dynamic engagement with the interlocutor. Leaning forward might denote interest and sincerity, encouraging connection and transparency. Conversely, it could be a subtle strategy to appear convincing or mask insecurity. Pulling the head backward might express discomfort or a subconscious desire to distance oneself from uncomfortable statements, suggesting possible deceit. Alternatively, it may simply indicate surprise or a natural break in the dialogue. Turning the head to the side could be seen as an attempt to avoid direct confrontation or scrutiny, yet it might also reflect thoughtfulness or an effort to consider the interlocutor’s perspective carefully.

Lastly, the subject’s open arms typically signify openness and honesty, creating an impression of trustworthiness. Nonetheless, this posture could be deliberately employed to foster rapport and disarm suspicion, potentially serving as a calculated tactic to deflect doubts about their credibility. Each of these behaviors holds plausible interpretations both supporting and questioning the subject's honesty, underscoring the importance of situating these cues within the larger conversational and contextual framework before drawing any conclusions about deception.

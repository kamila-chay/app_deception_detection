The subject’s frowning eyebrows might signal concentration or worry, which could indicate discomfort stemming from attempting to conceal the truth. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect genuine concern or confusion about the topic being discussed, without any deceptive intent. Their raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or incredulity, potentially hinting at an effort to fabricate or emphasize certain aspects of their story. On the other hand, the raised eyebrows could be an authentic reaction to unfamiliar or unexpected information presented during the interaction.

The lips protruded may be interpreted as a subtle sign of tension or hesitation, possibly aligning with the stress of deception. However, lip protrusion might also be a natural facial movement unrelated to dishonesty, such as a habitual gesture or an expression of thoughtfulness. Maintaining a gaze towards the interlocutor might be viewed as an attempt to establish control or to convince, suggesting deliberate engagement in a deceptive narrative. Alternatively, steady eye contact is often associated with sincerity and confidence, indicating openness and truthfulness.

Lastly, the subject’s open arms posture could imply a strategic display of openness designed to allay suspicion and foster trust, which might be consciously employed in a deceptive context. Conversely, open arms can straightforwardly communicate receptiveness and honesty, reflecting a genuine and transparent disposition. Given these behaviors’ dual potential meanings, broader contextual information is crucial to draw a more definitive conclusion about the subject’s veracity.

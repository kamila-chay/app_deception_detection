The individual’s steady gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may indicate confidence and sincerity, suggesting that the person is being open and honest in their communication. Consistent eye contact can also reflect engagement and a willingness to connect, which are often associated with truthful behavior. Conversely, this same gaze might be a deliberate strategy to persuade or manipulate, as some deceivers maintain strong eye contact to mask their dishonesty and appear more convincing. In this context, the sustained gaze could be a rehearsed effort to avoid suspicion or to control the interaction.

Similarly, the subject’s use of open palms presents a dual interpretation. Open palms are frequently viewed as a sign of openness and honesty, symbolizing transparency and a lack of concealment. This gesture can serve to reinforce the idea that the person is trustworthy and not hiding anything. However, open palms can also be consciously employed as a calming or disarming tactic, aimed at reducing the interlocutor’s skepticism and fostering trust regardless of the truthfulness of the message. In some cases, it may mask underlying tension or control attempts rather than genuine openness.

Ultimately, while these behaviors—direct gaze and open palms—can be indicative of sincerity and engagement, they are not definitive proof of truthfulness. Both can be components of an honest interaction or tools utilized in deception, depending on the broader behavioral context and additional cues. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation incorporating other factors is essential to draw a more reliable conclusion.

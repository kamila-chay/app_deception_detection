The individual’s frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression could indicate stress related to fabricating information or withholding the truth. Conversely, it might simply reflect genuine concern or confusion about the topic being discussed, illustrating authentic engagement rather than deceit. The act of raising their eyebrows adds another layer of ambiguity; it could signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, portraying openness. Alternatively, this same gesture might be employed strategically to feign sincerity or to distract the interlocutor, thereby masking dishonesty.

Their steady gaze directed at the interlocutor is equally open to interpretation. Maintaining eye contact could imply confidence and transparency, a sign that the person has nothing to hide. However, such gaze could also be consciously maintained to avoid suspicion, as some deceivers are trained to counteract stereotypical signs of deception by appearing overly attentive. The forward movement of the head might demonstrate engagement and assertiveness, suggesting that the person is earnest and forthright. Conversely, this motion might serve as a subtle approach to establish dominance or control over the conversation, potentially indicating defensive behavior associated with deceit.

Furthermore, the display of palms turned up alongside open arms generally symbolizes openness and honesty, conveying a non-threatening and truthful demeanor. Yet, these same gestures can be deliberately used to evoke trust or sympathy, acting as a performative layer intended to obscure deceitful intentions. In sum, while these behaviors offer cues that could lean towards either truthfulness or deception, their true meaning is heavily context-dependent. Only by considering the broader interaction and additional situational factors can a more definitive interpretation be approached.

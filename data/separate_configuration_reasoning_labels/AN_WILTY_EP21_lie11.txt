The subject’s smile, combined with the upward movement of the lip corners, could suggest a genuine expression of positive emotion and openness, indicating honesty and comfort in the interaction. Conversely, such a smile might be a social or polite gesture aimed at masking true feelings or creating a favorable impression, which can sometimes be employed to deceive. The act of raising eyebrows can similarly be viewed from two perspectives: it might signal surprise, interest, or engagement that aligns with truthful communication, yet it could also be an attempt to feign innocence or emphasize sincerity, potentially to manipulate the listener’s perception. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor is often interpreted as a sign of confidence and truthfulness, demonstrating a willingness to connect and be transparent. However, sustained eye contact may also be consciously maintained to convince or distract, serving as a tactic to conceal deceit. Lastly, nodding during conversation can reinforce agreement and attentiveness, reinforcing the notion of credibility and genuine interaction. On the other hand, it might be strategically used to encourage the listener’s acceptance, subtly influencing the flow of dialogue without reflecting true conviction. Ultimately, these behaviors’ interpretations depend heavily on the broader context and baseline observations of the individual, underscoring the need for a comprehensive approach before drawing conclusions about deception.

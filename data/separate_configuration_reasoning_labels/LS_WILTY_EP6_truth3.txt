The subject’s lip corners are turned up, which could suggest a genuine smile reflecting comfort and honesty in the interaction. Alternatively, this expression might be a controlled social smile, masking discomfort or an attempt to appear more credible while being deceptive. Their gaze shifts between looking directly at the interlocutor and occasionally looking down. Direct eye contact can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and openness, yet in some cases, it may be a deliberate strategy to convey sincerity. Conversely, looking down might indicate evasiveness or discomfort associated with dishonesty, but it could equally reflect deep thought or emotional processing related to recalling information. The subject is also shaking their head, which might signal disagreement or denial, potentially supporting a truthful stance if they are refuting false accusations. However, it could also be a subtle attempt to discredit questions or mislead the listener. Their head is held up, which could convey self-assuredness and transparency, but it might also be a sign of putting on a confident façade. The individual’s hands are touching their head and body, gestures often linked to nervousness or self-soothing behaviors when someone is concealing information. On the other hand, these actions could simply be habitual or a response to physical discomfort rather than indicators of deception. Finally, the subject’s shrugging may suggest uncertainty or a genuine lack of knowledge, which aligns with truthful behavior. Conversely, it could also be a dismissive gesture intended to deflect further inquiry. Assessing these behaviors in isolation is insufficient; a broader context and baseline behaviors are essential to draw any reliable conclusions about their truthfulness.

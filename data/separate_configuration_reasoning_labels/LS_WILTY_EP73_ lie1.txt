The subject is observed raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can carry multiple interpretations depending on the broader communicative context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an involuntary reaction to recalling or presenting information, suggesting engagement and perhaps truthfulness. Conversely, this same gesture can be consciously exaggerated to lend credibility or manipulate the interlocutor’s perception, potentially indicating deception. Their gaze towards the interlocutor further complicates the analysis. Direct eye contact is often seen as a sign of honesty and confidence, implying that the person is forthcoming and sincere. However, sustained or intense eye contact can also be a strategic tactic to assert dominance or conceal deceit, making it a possible indicator of fabrication. At the same time, moments where the gaze shifts downward add an additional layer to consider. Looking down might reflect internal emotional states such as shame or guilt, which could be associated with dishonesty. Yet, it can equally be an expression of momentary contemplation or discomfort unrelated to deceit, such as processing complex information or social anxiety. Altogether, these behaviors—raising eyebrows, alternating gaze between interlocutor and downward—can be interpreted in multiple, even opposing ways. Without further contextual cues, each gesture could support arguments for both truthfulness and deception, underscoring the necessity of incorporating additional information to reach a more definitive conclusion.

The subject's exaggerated eye opening can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, such behavior might suggest an attempt to appear more sincere or attentive, potentially indicating a conscious effort to convince the interlocutor and thereby raising suspicions of deception. Conversely, it could simply reflect genuine surprise or an attempt to emphasize interest and engagement in the conversation, which would be consistent with truthful behavior.

Their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor also invites dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact might be seen as a strategy to establish credibility or control the narrative, which some associate with deceptive intent. However, it can equally indicate openness and a desire for authentic communication, as truthful individuals are often motivated to connect directly with their conversational partner.

The head tilting adds another layer of complexity. This gesture could be read as a sign of uncertainty or discomfort, possibly reflecting the subject’s internal struggle with fabricated information. On the other hand, head tilting is frequently linked to active listening and empathy, which would support the notion of honesty and genuine engagement. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues, these behaviors remain ambiguous, highlighting the importance of a holistic assessment when considering the possibility of deception.

The subject’s lips are retracted, which could be interpreted in dual ways. On one hand, this expression might reflect tension and discomfort often associated with withholding information or fabricating a story. On the other hand, it might simply indicate concentration or an attempt to maintain composure during the interaction, without any deceptive intent. Their gaze towards the interlocutor suggests engagement and openness, which can signal sincerity and confidence in their statements. Conversely, sustained eye contact might also be a deliberate strategy to appear truthful while masking deception, as some individuals are aware that avoiding gaze can be perceived as dishonesty.

At moments, the subject’s gaze shifts downward, a behavior commonly linked to avoidance or internal conflict, possibly indicating uncertainty or deliberate evasion. Alternatively, this could be a natural response to processing complex information or recalling details, reflecting genuine cognitive effort rather than deceit. Finally, the use of palms up gestures is often interpreted as a nonverbal cue of openness and honesty, suggesting the subject is trying to demonstrate transparency. Yet, such gestures can also be consciously employed to manipulate the listener’s perception and foster trust, complicating the assessment.

In sum, each of these behaviors holds ambiguous significance and can be viewed through different lenses depending on the broader context. Without additional information, it is challenging to definitively categorize the subject’s demeanor as either truthful or deceptive, underscoring the need for a holistic evaluation of verbal and nonverbal cues together.

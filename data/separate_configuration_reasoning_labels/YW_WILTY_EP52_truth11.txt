The subject raises their eyebrows during the interaction, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or heightened alertness, which could suggest they are reacting to unexpected questions or the pressure of being scrutinized, potentially indicating deceit. Conversely, this same gesture can simply convey genuine interest or engagement in the conversation, reflecting openness and honesty. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, a behavior that might denote confidence and sincerity, implying that they have nothing to hide and are willing to maintain eye contact to reinforce trustworthiness. However, in certain contexts, steady eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear convincing while fabricating information, as some deceivers overcompensate by maintaining prolonged gaze to mask their dishonesty. Additionally, the subject’s arms are open, which typically could be seen as a sign of openness and receptiveness, suggesting a truthful and cooperative attitude. Alternatively, an open arm posture might be consciously adopted to project transparency and warmth, potentially as a façade to divert suspicion and facilitate deception. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader situational context and corroborating verbal and nonverbal cues to form a more reliable assessment.

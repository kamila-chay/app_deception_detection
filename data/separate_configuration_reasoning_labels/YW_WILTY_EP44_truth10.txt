The subject’s scowl and frowning eyebrows might be interpreted as signs of discomfort or distress, which could suggest that they are experiencing anxiety related to deception, perhaps struggling to maintain a fabricated narrative. On the other hand, these facial expressions could simply reflect genuine concern, frustration, or concentration, which are natural emotional responses during serious or difficult conversations. The downward pull of the lip corners similarly might indicate unease or internal conflict commonly associated with withholding truth or feeling guilty. However, this same expression might also arise from sadness, disappointment, or disagreement, none of which necessarily imply dishonesty. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might be an attempt to assert control or convincingly connect, potentially a tactic to compensate for deceit. Conversely, maintaining eye contact could also demonstrate sincerity and openness, reflecting honest engagement rather than concealment. Without additional context or supporting cues, it is challenging to definitively interpret these behaviors as indicative of truthfulness or deception, as each could plausibly result from a range of emotional states or communicative intentions.

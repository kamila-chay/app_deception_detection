The subject’s gaze directed downward can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, such behavior might suggest that the person is feeling uncomfortable or guilty, potentially attempting to avoid direct eye contact as a way to conceal dishonesty or evade scrutiny. Lowered gaze may also indicate cognitive load, as the individual internally processes or fabricates information, which is often associated with deceptive behavior. Conversely, looking down could simply reflect a natural moment of reflection or thoughtfulness, where the person is concentrating on recalling accurate information rather than constructing a false narrative. It might also be a cultural or habitual gesture that doesn’t signify any hidden intent. In the absence of additional contextual cues, the downward gaze alone is insufficient to conclusively determine truthfulness or deception, underscoring the importance of considering the broader communicative environment and behavioral baseline before drawing firm conclusions.

The subject’s smile combined with raised eyebrows could be seen as an attempt to project sincerity and openness, suggesting they are genuinely engaged and truthful. However, such expressions might also be consciously employed to mask discomfort or manipulate the interlocutor’s perception, potentially signaling deception. Frequent blinking often raises suspicion as it may indicate nervousness or cognitive load associated with fabricating information. Conversely, increased blinking can simply be a physiological response to stress or environmental factors, and not necessarily a sign of dishonesty. The subject’s shifting lip corners—from up to down—introduce a complex dynamic; while upward lip corners may convey friendliness and truthfulness, the sudden downturn might reveal underlying discomfort or inconsistency in emotional state, which can be interpreted both as nervousness tied to deception or momentary doubt or sadness unrelated to deceit. Their gaze behavior fluctuates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways. Maintaining eye contact frequently supports the impression of honesty and confidence, yet deliberate gaze fixation can sometimes be a conscious effort to convince. Sideways glances might indicate evasion or fabrication, but they can also reflect cognitive processing, such as trying to retrieve memories. Finally, the subject’s nodding may be seen as an affirmation of truthfulness and agreement, promoting rapport and trust. On the other hand, it could be a learned social cue or a strategy to encourage positive feedback, which does not necessarily confirm veracity. Ultimately, these observed behaviors could suggest both honesty and deception, depending on the broader context and additional cues.

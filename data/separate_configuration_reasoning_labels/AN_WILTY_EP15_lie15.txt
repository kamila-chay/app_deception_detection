The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest confidence and sincerity, potentially signaling that the person is being truthful and open in the conversation. It could reflect engagement and a genuine effort to communicate clearly and honestly. On the other hand, consistent gaze might also be a deliberate strategy to appear trustworthy or to mask deceptive intentions, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to project credibility and avoid suspicion.

Regarding the crossed arms, this posture similarly offers ambiguous cues. Crossing the arms might indicate defensiveness or discomfort, possibly reflecting an attempt to create a barrier when confronted with questions that induce stress or anxiety, which could be associated with deceptive behavior. Conversely, folded arms can simply represent a habitual or comfortable resting position without any negative implications. They may signify that the person is simply feeling relaxed, thoughtful, or reserved rather than guarded or evasive.

Taken together, the combination of sustained eye contact and folded arms presents a nuanced behavioral pattern that resists a straightforward interpretation. Contextual factors such as the individual’s baseline behavior, cultural norms, and the nature of the conversation must therefore be carefully considered before drawing conclusions about truthfulness or deception.

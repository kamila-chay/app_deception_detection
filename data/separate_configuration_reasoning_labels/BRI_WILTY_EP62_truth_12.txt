The person’s gaze directed upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking up might suggest that they are accessing their memory or attempting to construct a story, which could be indicative of fabricating information or searching for a plausible narrative. This behavior is often associated with cognitive effort, which some might link to deceptive responses. On the other hand, an upward gaze could simply reflect natural thought processing or reflection, such as recalling genuine memories or organizing their thoughts before responding. In many cases, people glance upward when trying to focus or remember details, without any deceptive intent. In the absence of additional contextual cues, this particular behavior alone should be approached with caution, as it can equally support interpretations of truthfulness or deceit depending on the broader circumstances and accompanying signals.

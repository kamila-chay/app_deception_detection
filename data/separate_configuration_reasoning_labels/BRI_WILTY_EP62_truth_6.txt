The subject’s decision to keep their arms folded could be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. On one hand, crossing the arms might suggest a defensive or closed-off posture, possibly indicating discomfort or a subconscious attempt to create a barrier between themselves and the interviewer, which can be common when someone is concealing information or feeling vulnerable due to dishonesty. Conversely, this same behavior might simply reflect a habitual or comfortable resting position, or a way to regulate body temperature, without any relation to their truthfulness. Additionally, folded arms can signal contemplation or a neutral stance, where the person is carefully considering their responses rather than trying to deceive. Depending on the broader context, such as their baseline behaviors, facial expressions, and environmental factors, the folded arms could thus be either a subtle cue of guardedness linked to deception or merely an innocuous mannerism with no deceptive intent. Without further evidence or additional behavioral indicators, it is difficult to conclusively interpret this gesture in isolation.

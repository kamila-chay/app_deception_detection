The subject’s tendency to gaze downward can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking down might suggest discomfort or an effort to avoid direct eye contact, which some theories link to feelings of guilt or the cognitive load involved in fabricating information. This behavior could imply that the person is attempting to conceal the truth or is uncertain about the accuracy of their statements. Conversely, a downward gaze may simply reflect introspection or concentration, as the individual gathers their thoughts or reflects on the question being asked. It might also be a cultural or habitual way of displaying respect or attentiveness, rather than a sign of evasiveness. Without additional contextual cues or baseline behaviors, the downward gaze alone does not provide definitive evidence of deception or truthfulness, and it is essential to view it within the broader communicative and situational framework.

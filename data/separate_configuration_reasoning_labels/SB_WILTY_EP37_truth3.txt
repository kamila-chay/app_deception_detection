The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signal surprise or emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and honesty. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a subtle attempt to manipulate or feign incredulity, which may point toward deceptive intent depending on the context. The downward movement of the chin might indicate submission or contemplation, which could reflect genuine reflection or uncertainty while communicating truthfully. Alternatively, lowering the chin can sometimes be a defensive posture used to conceal discomfort or concealment, potentially aligning with deceptive behavior.

Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking downward. Direct eye contact may suggest engagement and honesty, reinforcing trustworthiness. However, persistent gaze can also be a controlled behavior meant to convince or intimidate, masking deceptive motives. On the other hand, looking down might be a natural sign of thoughtfulness or even humility, supporting truthful disclosure. Conversely, avertive gaze can be linked to discomfort or avoidance, which might indicate dishonesty or evasion.

The presence of nodding and turning the head to the side introduces additional ambiguity. Nodding can serve as a positive feedback mechanism, indicating agreement and attentiveness, consistent with truthful interaction. Yet, it could also be an automatic or rehearsed response intended to appear cooperative while concealing deceit. Similarly, a head side-turn might reflect openness and active listening, or alternatively, might suggest evasiveness or an attempt to physically distance oneself from uncomfortable truths.

Finally, the open positioning of the arms generally conveys receptiveness and a lack of guardedness, qualities typically associated with sincerity. Still, open arms can also be a strategic posture employed to lower the interlocutor’s defenses, making a deceptive individual seem more trustworthy.

In sum, each observed behavior carries interpretations that could plausibly represent either transparency or deception. Without additional contextual or baseline information, these behaviors alone cannot conclusively determine truthfulness, underscoring the necessity of a holistic assessment.

The individual raises their eyebrows during the interaction, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing veracity. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, potentially reflecting genuine reactions or the engagement of truthful communication. Conversely, such a gesture could also be employed consciously or unconsciously to convey feigned surprise or to distract from deceptive statements. Their lips curl upward slightly, suggesting a subtle smile, which might indicate comfort and sincerity, reinforcing the notion of truthful exchanges. However, this expression could equally function as a social mask intended to appear agreeable or to deflect suspicion, introducing ambiguity into the interpretation. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor typically denotes attentiveness and openness, qualities often associated with honesty. Yet, prolonged or overly fixed eye contact can also be a strategic attempt to assert dominance or control the narrative, potentially masking deceitful intentions. Additionally, the person’s hands frequently touch their head or other parts of their body, a gesture that might reflect nervousness or internal conflict linked to fabricating information. On the other hand, these self-soothing actions might simply be habitual or responses to external stressors unrelated to dishonesty. Ultimately, without further contextual clues, each of these behaviors holds dual potential, underscoring the importance of integrating broader situational factors and baseline behaviors before drawing conclusions about truthfulness.

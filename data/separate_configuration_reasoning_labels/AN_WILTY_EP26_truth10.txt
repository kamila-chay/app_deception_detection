The subject’s gaze toward the interlocutor could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often suggests engagement and confidence, which might indicate that the person is being truthful and open. Conversely, prolonged or intense eye contact can also be a calculated effort to convince or dominate the conversation, potentially signaling an attempt to mask deceit. When the subject looks down, this behavior might be viewed as a moment of contemplation or humility, possibly reflecting honesty through self-reflection or discomfort with the topic at hand. However, looking downward can equally be perceived as evasiveness or an effort to avoid direct confrontation, which may hint at discomfort stemming from dishonesty. The upward tilt of the head may similarly carry ambiguous meanings; it can denote confidence and assertiveness, traits often aligned with truthful communication. Alternatively, such a gesture might be interpreted as arrogance or an attempt to appear superior, which could serve as a defensive tactic when fabricating responses. Ultimately, these behaviors are open to varying interpretations, and considering the broader context and additional cues is essential to form a balanced and informed assessment of their veracity.

They are maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Sustained eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, reflecting a sincere engagement with the conversation and a willingness to be open. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear trustworthy and divert suspicion, especially if the individual is trying to mask deceit. On the other hand, gaze directed toward the interlocutor could simply be a natural conversational norm or a cultural habit, without any underlying implications regarding truthfulness. However, if the gaze seems unusually intense or fixed, it might indicate an attempt to control the interaction or manage the perception of credibility, which can be a red flag for deception. Ultimately, without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, the significance of this gaze behavior remains ambiguous and should be interpreted with caution.

The individual is smiling with the corners of their lips turned up, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this smile might signal genuine friendliness and openness, suggesting sincerity in their communication. Conversely, such a smile could be a calculated attempt to appear more credible or likable, potentially masking deceptive intentions. Their eyebrows are raised, a gesture that might reflect surprise or engagement, indicating attentiveness and honesty. Alternatively, the eyebrow raise could serve as a subtle signal designed to elicit trust or distract from inconsistencies in their narrative. The subject’s gaze is directed toward the interlocutor, which often aligns with straightforwardness and confidence in what is being conveyed. However, the same gaze could also be a deliberate tactic to establish rapport and reduce suspicion, even if the content is misleading.

The occasional downward gaze might suggest moments of reflection or discomfort, perhaps revealing uncertainty or hidden emotions tied to deception. On the flip side, looking down could simply reflect thoughtfulness or cultural communication styles that do not necessarily correlate with deceit. The side-turn of the head is another ambiguous indicator: it may denote evasion and a reluctance to fully engage, hinting at potential dishonesty. Yet, such a gesture can also convey empathy, active listening, or a natural part of conversational dynamics unrelated to untruthfulness. Lastly, the subject’s open arms posture could be seen as an inviting and transparent stance, promoting a sense of openness likely aligned with truthfulness. Alternatively, open arms might be a conscious effort to appear non-threatening and forthcoming, which while positive in demeanor, does not categorically confirm honesty.

Ultimately, each behavior exhibits dual interpretations that could either support or undermine the assumption of truthfulness. Comprehensive evaluation of additional verbal content, contextual cues, and baseline behaviors is essential before drawing informed conclusions about the individual’s credibility.

The subject’s raised eyebrows can be viewed from two perspectives. On one hand, this gesture might reflect surprise or incredulity, potentially signaling an effort to emphasize truthfulness or express genuine reaction. Conversely, raised eyebrows could be a deliberate attempt to create an impression of openness or innocence, which might be a subtle cue of deception if inconsistent with the verbal content or overall demeanor. Similarly, the slight upward movement of the lip corners carries ambiguous meaning. It might represent a polite or genuine smile, indicating comfort and confidence in what is being conveyed. Alternatively, this expression could mask underlying discomfort or serve as a social lubricant designed to deflect suspicion when fabricating information.

Their gaze directed upwards also warrants dual interpretation. Looking upwards might indicate cognitive processing, as the individual searches their memory to provide accurate details, suggesting honesty. However, upward gaze has also been theorized to coincide with accessing imagination or constructing fabrications, implying possible deceit. Additionally, the subject’s frequent touching of their head or body can be interpreted in multiple ways. Such gestures might stem from nervousness or stress associated with withholding or manipulating the truth. Yet, these behaviors could just as easily be habitual or self-soothing, unrelated to any deceptive intent.

Likewise, covering the face or mouth is a complex behavior open to interpretation. It may signify an unconscious attempt to inhibit speech or conceal emotions, behaviors often linked to deception. Conversely, this action might simply be a natural reaction to discomfort, embarrassment, or even a momentary lapse in confidence, with no connection to deceit. Without broader contextual information—such as baseline behaviors, verbal consistency, and situational cues—it is difficult to definitively categorize these behaviors as indicators of truthfulness or deception, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach to analysis.

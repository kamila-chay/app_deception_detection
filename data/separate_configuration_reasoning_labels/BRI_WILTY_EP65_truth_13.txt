The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context of their behavior and the situation at hand. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or uncertainty, which in the context of deception could suggest that the individual is caught off guard or feeling uneasy while attempting to conceal information. It could also be an involuntary reaction reflecting cognitive load, as they process fabrications or weigh their responses carefully. Conversely, eyebrow-raising might simply indicate genuine surprise, curiosity, or a natural facial expression aligned with the emotional content of their truthful statements. In many cases, people raise their eyebrows to emphasize sincerity or openness, thereby supporting the notion that they are being truthful. Without additional cues or contextual details, the act of raising eyebrows alone remains ambiguous; it can either be a subtle indicator of deception or a habitual, sincere expression. Therefore, a comprehensive interpretation requires considering this behavior alongside other verbal and non-verbal signals to better understand its significance.

The subject exhibits frequent blinking, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, rapid blinking might suggest cognitive overload or stress, potentially indicative of discomfort associated with deception. On the other hand, it could simply reflect normal physiological responses to lighting conditions or momentary eye irritation, without any connection to dishonesty. Their lip corners are turned downward, paired with lips that are protruded; this facial expression might signal unease or tension, possibly stemming from withholding information. Conversely, such expressions could be habitual or linked to concentration and thoughtfulness, rather than deceptive intent. The slight downward movement of the chin may also be telling. It might indicate a subconscious attempt to shield oneself or convey submissiveness, which some studies connect to deceptive behavior. Yet, it might just be a relaxed or neutral posture that coincides with their mannerisms. Notably, the subject maintains gaze toward the interlocutor, which often contradicts stereotypical notions of avoiding eye contact when lying. However, sustained gaze can also be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate and appear sincere. Their gaze occasionally shifts upward, potentially reflecting moments of mental searching or fabrication, but this gesture is equally common when recalling genuine memories. The head tilting and side-turning could suggest discomfort or evasiveness, possibly linked to deception, but these gestures might also be signs of engagement or natural listening behavior. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered within the full communicative context, as each could have multiple interpretations depending on the situation and individual differences.

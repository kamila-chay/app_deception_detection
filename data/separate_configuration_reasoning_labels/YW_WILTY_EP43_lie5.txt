The subject maintains a direct gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be seen as a sign of sincerity and engagement, suggesting openness and honesty. Conversely, this sustained eye contact might also be a deliberate effort to appear credible and mask deceptive intentions, as some individuals overcompensate by staring to convince others of their truthfulness. Their gaze occasionally shifts upward, a behavior often interpreted as an attempt to access internal thoughts or fabricate information, potentially hinting at deception. However, this upward gaze could equally indicate genuine cognitive processing or recall of memories, reflecting thoughtfulness rather than dishonesty. The open palms displayed may convey a gesture of openness, honesty, and trustworthiness, fostering a perception of transparency. On the other hand, such a gesture might be consciously employed to enhance the appearance of truthfulness, serving as a calculated nonverbal cue aimed at persuasion. Likewise, the open arms posture can be interpreted as welcoming and non-defensive, which supports the impression of a truthful communicator. Yet, it could also function as a strategic body language choice designed to reduce suspicion and present a façade of sincerity. Ultimately, without additional contextual information, these behaviors can be reasonably interpreted in both directions, underscoring the need for a holistic assessment before drawing conclusions about the subject’s veracity.

The subject exhibits an exaggerated opening of the mouth, which can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of emotional exaggeration or an unconscious attempt to appear more convincing during deception. However, this behavior might equally reflect genuine surprise or emphasis in their communication, highlighting the importance of considering contextual cues. Their chin movements, alternating between upward and downward positions, could suggest a display of assertiveness or submission. Such gestures might be consciously employed to project confidence while fabricating information or, conversely, could simply be natural indicators of thoughtfulness or varying degrees of engagement in the conversation.

The gaze behavior also presents a complex picture. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor often signals openness and sincerity, yet it can also be strategically maintained to mask deceit or to appear trustworthy. Conversely, looking down could indicate discomfort or evasiveness; on the other hand, it might just be the person reflecting internally or experiencing momentary shyness. The subject’s nodding might be interpreted as an attempt to appear agreeable and cooperative, potentially as a way to reinforce a fabricated narrative. Alternatively, it could genuinely reflect active listening and understanding.

Additionally, the presence of scratching and touching various parts of the body can be viewed through two lenses. Such self-directed gestures are sometimes linked to anxiety or stress associated with deception, but they might just as well be habitual or self-soothing behaviors unrelated to truthfulness. Finally, the subject’s open arm posture can imply openness and receptivity, which would support a truthful interaction; yet, it might also be a deliberate tactic to appear non-threatening and gain trust. In sum, while these behaviors provide valuable cues, each has multiple plausible interpretations, underscoring the necessity of integrating broader contextual information before drawing conclusions about the subject’s honesty.

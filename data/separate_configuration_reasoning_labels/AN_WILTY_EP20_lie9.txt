The subject’s gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and then shifting downward, can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest engagement and confidence in their statements, indicating they have nothing to conceal. Similarly, occasional downward glances could reflect natural moments of thoughtfulness or reflection as they process their own words, which can be typical in sincere communication. On the other hand, sustained gaze towards the interlocutor could be a conscious effort to appear credible and maintain control over the interaction, potentially masking discomfort or deceit. Meanwhile, looking down can sometimes signal evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation, which might arise from feelings of guilt or the stress of fabricating information. Ultimately, without additional contextual clues, these gaze patterns alone do not definitively indicate truthfulness or deception but rather highlight the complexity of interpreting nonverbal cues in interpersonal communication.

The person’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, these expressions may suggest genuine friendliness and openness, which are often associated with honesty. A sincere smile tends to involve the entire face, conveying positive emotions and reinforcing trustworthiness. However, these same smiles and lip movements can be consciously controlled to mask discomfort or to feign agreement, potentially serving as a social lubricant when someone is attempting to deceive. Thus, what appears as a warm smile could also be a strategic behavior designed to distract or manipulate.

The raising of the eyebrows is another behavior with dual interpretations. When sincere, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or a truthful reaction to new information. They can also indicate attentiveness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows could be a deliberate nonverbal cue intended to elicit sympathy or to appear more persuasive, which might be employed by someone who is not fully forthcoming. Without additional context, it is difficult to ascertain whether this is a spontaneous response or a rehearsed gesture.

The gaze directed downward presents a similarly ambiguous signal. A lowered gaze is often linked to feelings of guilt, shame, or evasion, which could be consistent with deceptive behavior. Avoiding eye contact in this way might indicate discomfort or an attempt to hide the truth. Yet, cultural norms and individual differences can also explain a downward gaze, such as modesty, respect, or deep thoughtfulness. It could equally reflect momentary self-reflection or nervousness unrelated to dishonesty.

In sum, each of these behaviors—smiling, eyebrow raising, and gazing downward—carries potential indicators both for truthfulness and deception. The true meaning behind them can only be better understood by considering the broader context, baseline behaviors, and any accompanying verbal and nonverbal cues. Without this, drawing definitive conclusions remains speculative.

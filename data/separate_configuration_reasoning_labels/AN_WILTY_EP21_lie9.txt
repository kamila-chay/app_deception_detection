The subject's steady gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining direct eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as individuals who are truthful often feel comfortable facing their listener without evasion. This behavior could indicate openness and a willingness to engage sincerely in the conversation. Conversely, it is also possible that the subject is deliberately sustaining eye contact to appear credible and mask potential dishonesty, as some individuals are aware that avoiding eye contact is commonly associated with deception and thus compensate by intensifying their gaze. Additionally, cultural and personal communication styles can influence eye contact patterns, meaning that what might be a sign of truthfulness in one context could be an affectation in another. Without understanding the broader situational context and baseline behaviors specific to the individual, the gaze alone cannot conclusively indicate honesty or deceit but rather highlights the importance of integrating this observation with other behavioral cues and contextual information.

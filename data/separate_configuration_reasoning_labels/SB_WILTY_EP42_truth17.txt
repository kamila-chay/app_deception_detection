The subject’s exaggerated mouth opening could be interpreted in multiple ways. It might suggest an attempt to emphasize a point or feign surprise, potentially indicating a rehearsed or deceptive narrative. Conversely, it could simply reflect genuine astonishment or emotional engagement in the conversation, highlighting their sincerity. Similarly, the shifts between having the mouth closed and lips retracted might point to internal conflict or hesitation, which some theories associate with deception. On the other hand, these movements could be natural variations in speech or expressions of thoughtfulness, unrelated to any intent to deceive.

The downward movement of the chin might signal discomfort or submissiveness, behaviors sometimes linked to concealment or evasion. Yet, this gesture could also be a sign of reflection or modesty, aspects commonly seen in honest communication. The subject’s varying gaze patterns—looking directly at the interlocutor as well as occasionally casting their gaze downward—further complicate the interpretation. Direct eye contact might suggest confidence and transparency, but it might also be consciously maintained to mask dishonesty. Alternatively, looking down could indicate avoidance or guilt, or it could simply represent moments of internal processing or searching for the right words.

Nodding and head tilting are generally associated with engagement and active listening, but they can also be deliberate strategies to build rapport or persuade, which might coincide with deceptive intent. Conversely, these behaviors may authentically reflect the person’s interest and empathy in the interaction. Without additional context, each behavior presents a plausible explanation on both sides of the truth spectrum. A comprehensive assessment would require integrating these observations with the conversational content, baseline behaviors, and situational factors to arrive at a more informed judgment.

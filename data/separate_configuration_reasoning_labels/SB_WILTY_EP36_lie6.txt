The subject’s smile, coupled with the corners of the lips turning upward, might initially suggest a genuine expression of positive emotion or comfort in the conversation. However, in a different context, such a smile could be a deliberate, controlled attempt to mask true feelings or to present a facade of sincerity. The presence of a scowl and frowning eyebrows introduces further complexity: these expressions could reflect genuine frustration, confusion, or concern about the topic at hand, indicating truthful engagement with difficult information. Conversely, these same expressions might serve as deliberate signals to deflect or distract the interlocutor, creating an impression of sincerity while concealing deception.

Raising eyebrows typically signals surprise or heightened attention, which could be interpreted as a truthful reaction to new or unexpected information. Yet, it may also be strategically employed to feign openness or innocence, thereby calming suspicion. The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor might imply straightforwardness and willingness to engage openly, but alternating this with other micro-expressions could also suggest an effort to carefully monitor the listener’s reactions while constructing a deceptive narrative.

Head shaking is another ambiguous behavior; it could simply indicate honest negation or disagreement with what is being discussed. Alternatively, if paired with other subtle cues, head shaking might function as a rehearsed gesture aimed at reinforcing a false denial. The subject’s hands rubbing and frequent touching of the head or other body parts often signal discomfort or anxiety, potentially hinting at the internal stress of fabricating or withholding information. Yet, these actions may equally be benign self-soothing behaviors rooted in natural nervousness, unrelated to deception.

Lastly, the posture with arms open could denote a willingness to be transparent and open, supporting the impression of truthfulness. On the other hand, this openness might be a conscious strategy to appear more trustworthy, masking any underlying duplicity. Given these nuanced interpretations, it is clear that without additional context—such as baseline behaviors, verbal content consistency, and situational factors—drawing a definitive conclusion about the subject’s truthfulness or deceitfulness remains challenging. Each observed behavior can be reasonably argued both for and against the presence of deception, underscoring the importance of a holistic assessment.

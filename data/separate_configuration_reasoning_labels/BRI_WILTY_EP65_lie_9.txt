The subject’s gaze directed upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking up might suggest an effort to access memories or to construct a narrative, which could indicate the person is fabricating or modifying information. This upward gaze is often associated with visual memory recall or imaginative thinking, potentially signaling that they are trying to piece together details that are not genuinely remembered. Conversely, this same behavior might simply reflect a natural cognitive process of thinking or concentration, with the person searching their memory to provide an honest and accurate response. In this view, the upward gaze aligns with genuine reflection rather than deception. Without additional behavioral context or verbal cues, it remains ambiguous whether this action stems from evasiveness or honest contemplation. Therefore, attributing deception based solely on a gaze directed upwards would be premature, and it is essential to consider this behavior within a broader pattern of communication and interaction.

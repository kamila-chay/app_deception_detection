The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest concentration or discomfort, potentially stemming from the mental effort involved in fabricating details or concealing information. Conversely, frowning can also simply indicate confusion or concern about the topic being discussed, rather than deceit. Raising eyebrows further complicates the interpretation. While raised eyebrows may signal surprise or disbelief, which might be a genuine reaction, they can also serve as a calculated attempt to appear earnest or emphasize sincerity.

Frequent blinking is often cited as a sign of nervousness, possibly linked to the cognitive load or anxiety associated with deception. However, blinking rates naturally vary among individuals and can increase due to environmental factors such as dry eyes or lighting conditions, making this an unreliable standalone cue. The downward pull of the lip corners might reflect sadness or frustration connected to deception, yet it is equally plausible that the person is simply expressing genuine emotional distress about the conversation's content.

Lips that are protruded may hint at tension or discomfort, potentially a nonverbal cue of withholding information or attempting to control verbal output. On the other hand, this expression could just be a habitual or unconscious facial gesture without any deceptive intent. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor can suggest confidence and openness, supporting the idea of truthfulness. Yet, sustained eye contact can also be deliberately employed to mask deceit, as some individuals consciously hold a gaze to appear more convincing.

Lastly, the act of head shaking could indicate disagreement with the interlocutor’s statements, possibly a defensive gesture to distance oneself from false accusations or to reinforce an honest denial. Alternatively, it might be a subtle sign of internal conflict that accompanies deception, as the person struggles to reconcile their words with their true feelings. Without additional context, these behaviors remain ambiguous, and interpretation requires careful consideration of the broader situational cues and individual baseline behaviors to draw more reliable conclusions.

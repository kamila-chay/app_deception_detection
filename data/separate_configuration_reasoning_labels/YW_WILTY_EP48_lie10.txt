The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, this expression might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, suggesting openness and engagement with the interlocutor. Conversely, it could also be a subtle cue indicating skepticism or incredulity, possibly employed to feign sincerity or to distract from misleading information. Similarly, the slight upward movement of the lip corners often denotes a genuine smile that signals warmth and truthfulness. However, this expression can also be a controlled or polite smile aimed at masking discomfort or concealing deceit, especially if it appears forced or inconsistent with other emotional cues.

Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen as a sign of confidence and truthfulness, implying they have nothing to hide and are willing to maintain eye contact to support their narrative. On the other hand, sustained eye contact might be consciously maintained as a strategy to persuade or manipulate, intended to appear credible while potentially fabricating details. The gesture of displaying open palms is typically interpreted as a nonverbal signal of honesty and transparency, reinforcing the notion of openness and a lack of concealment. Yet, this same gesture could also be a rehearsed or deliberate attempt to appear trustworthy, masking any underlying deceit.

Ultimately, without further contextual information, these behaviors can be reasonably argued to either support the subject’s truthfulness or suggest possible deception. The key lies in considering the broader situational dynamics and additional behavioral patterns to derive a more nuanced and reliable assessment.

The subject’s gaze shifting upwards may be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, looking up is often associated with visualizing or constructing images, which might suggest they are fabricating or embellishing details. Conversely, this same upward gaze can indicate genuine recall, as people often look up when trying to access memories stored visually, pointing towards truthfulness. Similarly, the downward gaze could be read as a potential sign of evasiveness or discomfort, possibly hinting at concealment or deceit. Yet, it might also reflect introspection or concentration, indicating the person is thoughtfully processing their response or feeling respectful, which does not inherently imply dishonesty. The act of nodding presents a dual interpretation as well. While frequent nodding could be a nonverbal attempt to reinforce credibility or persuade the listener, possibly masking deceit, it could equally be a natural response demonstrating agreement, empathy, or active listening, which aligns with sincerity. Ultimately, the meaning of these behaviors depends heavily on the broader context, including the subject’s baseline mannerisms, the nature of the interaction, and accompanying verbal cues, making isolated judgments about truthfulness or deception uncertain.

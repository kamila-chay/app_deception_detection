The person’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or an attempt to engage more openly with the interlocutor, which could be a sign of honesty. Conversely, this same gesture could serve as a subtle strategy to feign innocence or to distract attention, potentially signaling deception depending on the context. Their frequent blinking could similarly be seen through a dual lens. Increased blinking might reveal heightened cognitive load or stress associated with suppressing the truth, yet it can also be a natural physiological response to anxiety or simply a benign reaction to environmental factors like lighting or dryness in the eyes.

Regarding their gaze patterns, maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor is often regarded as a sign of honesty and confidence, suggesting openness and sincerity. However, intense or prolonged eye contact can also be a deliberate attempt to overcompensate and persuade, possibly masking deceit. When the person looks upward, it might indicate they are visualizing or recalling information accurately, which supports truthful communication. Alternatively, looking away or gaze directed upward can sometimes be associated with constructing a fabricated narrative or detaching from the current reality. Similarly, a downward gaze could signify shame or discomfort related to deceit, or it simply could be a natural reflection of introspection or nervousness without any deceptive intent.

Ultimately, these behaviors must be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction to draw any meaningful conclusions, as each gesture holds potential for multiple interpretations depending on the individual’s baseline behavior and situational factors.

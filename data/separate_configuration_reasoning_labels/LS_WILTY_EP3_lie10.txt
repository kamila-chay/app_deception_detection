The individual’s frequent blinking can be viewed through two distinct lenses. On one hand, it might suggest discomfort or anxiety often associated with deceptive behavior, as the cognitive load of fabricating information can increase blinking rate. Conversely, frequent blinking might simply be a natural physiological response to stress or environmental factors such as lighting, without any implication of dishonesty. Their lip corners turned downward could indicate sadness or unease, potentially signaling guilt or distress related to withholding the truth. However, this expression could equally reflect genuine emotional sadness or fatigue, unrelated to deception. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often suggests engagement and honesty, as a truthful person typically establishes direct eye contact. Yet, this behavior could also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to mask deceit. The backward movement of the head presents a similarly ambiguous cue; it might represent a subconscious distancing gesture, indicative of discomfort or an attempt to physically create space when being untruthful. On the other hand, it could merely be a natural reaction to a statement or a neutral posture adjustment not connected to deception. Lastly, the head shaking can be interpreted as a sign of disagreement or denial, which in the context of deception might be an effort to reject or deflect truth. Alternatively, it could simply affirm genuine disbelief or a natural reflex to a statement made by the interlocutor. Taken together, these behaviors offer plausible signals of both truthfulness and deception, and a comprehensive interpretation would require additional contextual information to discern their true meaning.

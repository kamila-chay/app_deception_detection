The individual’s direct gaze toward the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact is often associated with sincerity and openness, suggesting they are genuinely engaged and truthful in the conversation. Conversely, maintaining eye contact can also be a deliberate tactic used to feign honesty and distract from deceptive intent, making it challenging to determine authenticity solely based on this behavior. Their head shaking similarly carries ambiguous implications. It might signify genuine disagreement or denial, reinforcing the idea that they are being truthful and firmly standing by their statements. However, it could equally be a rehearsed gesture designed to convey refusal or disbelief, potentially masking internal contradictions or falsehoods. Meanwhile, the palms-up gesture is commonly linked to openness and honesty, often perceived as a nonverbal expression of transparency and willingness to communicate candidly. Yet, this same gesture can be consciously or subconsciously employed to appear conciliatory or to elicit sympathy, which might be part of a broader strategy to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception. Given these mixed signals, understanding the truthfulness of their behavior requires careful consideration of the broader context, including the consistency of their verbal narrative, situational factors, and baseline behaviors, rather than relying on isolated nonverbal cues alone.

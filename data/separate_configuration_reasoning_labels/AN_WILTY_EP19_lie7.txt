The subject’s gaze directed downward can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, looking down may suggest discomfort or insecurity, which often accompanies deceptive behavior as the individual might be attempting to avoid eye contact to conceal dishonesty or internal conflict. This behavior could be a subtle sign of cognitive load, as fabricating information typically requires more mental effort and can manifest through such nonverbal cues. Conversely, the downward gaze might simply reflect genuine contemplation or introspection, indicating the person is thoughtfully processing their response or recalling difficult memories. It might also be a cultural or habitual response that has no bearing on the truthfulness of their statements. Without additional context—such as verbal content, baseline behavior, or accompanying gestures—it is challenging to definitively interpret the downward gaze as either a marker of deception or truthfulness.

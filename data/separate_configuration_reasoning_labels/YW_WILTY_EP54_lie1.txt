The individual’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways: this expression might signal surprise or emphasize the truthfulness of their statements, indicating engagement and openness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle attempt to manipulate or feign sincerity, potentially masking uncertainty or discomfort beneath the surface. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor suggests attentiveness and confidence, which often aligns with honesty and straightforward communication. However, maintaining sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate effort to assert dominance or conceal deceit, as some individuals use intense eye contact to deflect suspicion. The backward movement of the head might imply a moment of distancing or hesitation, potentially hinting at discomfort with the topic or an unconscious withdrawal triggered by deceptive intent. Yet, this same gesture could simply reflect a natural reaction to processing information or a nonverbal cue of contemplation without any deceptive undertone. Finally, the subject’s palms-up gesture commonly conveys openness and honesty, fostering trust and transparency in interaction. On the other hand, this gesture might be employed strategically to appear more candid and disarming, thereby masking underlying deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors must be analyzed within the broader context of the conversation, as each could signify either truthfulness or deception depending on the surrounding verbal and nonverbal cues.

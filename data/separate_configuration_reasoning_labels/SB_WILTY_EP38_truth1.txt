The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often signals engagement and sincerity, suggesting that the person is open and truthful. Conversely, it might also be a deliberate effort to appear honest and trustworthy, which could mask deceptive intentions. Their gaze shifting upward similarly invites dual interpretations. Looking up is sometimes associated with accessing one’s memory, indicating that the person is thoughtfully recalling information and thus being truthful. On the other hand, upward glances can be a cognitive strategy to fabricate details or mentally construct a narrative, hinting at possible deception. The head tilting adds another layer of ambiguity. Tilting the head is frequently viewed as a sign of curiosity and active listening, reinforcing the impression of honesty and openness. However, it could also be employed subconsciously as a way to feign attentiveness or to manipulate the conversation’s emotional tone, which might align with deceptive behavior. Ultimately, discerning truthfulness or deceit based on these behaviors alone is challenging; the broader context and additional cues are essential for forming a more reliable assessment.

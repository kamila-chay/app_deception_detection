The subject maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can carry different implications depending on the broader context. On one hand, direct eye contact often signals confidence and engagement, suggesting the person is forthcoming and truthful. It can be interpreted as a sign of openness and a desire to connect honestly during the interaction. On the other hand, prolonged or intense eye contact might be a strategic effort to project sincerity and mask underlying deceit. In some cases, individuals who are being deceptive consciously maintain eye contact to avoid appearing evasive or suspicious. Therefore, while their gaze towards the interlocutor could denote truthful communication, it may also be a calculated behavior to manipulate impressions. Without additional contextual cues, it is challenging to definitively associate this behavior with either honesty or deception.

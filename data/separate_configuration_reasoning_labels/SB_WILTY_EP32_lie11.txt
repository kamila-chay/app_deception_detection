The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways; they might signal surprise or emphasis intended to reinforce honesty, yet equally, such a gesture could be an exaggerated effort to appear sincere when fabricating information. Their closed mouth might suggest restraint or control, potentially reflecting an attempt to carefully manage what they divulge, which could hint at withholding or deceit. Conversely, it might simply indicate composure and a deliberate way of communicating without unnecessary verbal spillover. The subtle upward turn of the lip corners could be seen as a genuine smile conveying openness and truthfulness, but it might also represent a controlled or forced expression designed to mask discomfort or deceit. Lips that are slightly protruded might be a sign of tension or uncertainty, perhaps arising from the cognitive load of constructing a falsehood; yet, this same action could be a habitual or neutral mannerism unrelated to honesty. 

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often signals engagement and sincerity, yet intermittent sideways glances could be interpreted as avoiding eye contact to conceal dishonesty. Still, those sideways glances might simply reflect the natural process of memory retrieval or momentary distraction, rather than intentional deception. The person’s nodding can be perceived as agreement and reassurance, reinforcing credibility, but if excessive or out of sync with verbal content, it might be a compensatory gesture to convince the listener falsely. Similarly, head shaking could denote disagreement or denial, which may align with truthful negation, or alternatively, be a tactic to reinforce a deceitful claim. Lastly, folded arms commonly suggest defensiveness or self-protection, potentially indicating discomfort associated with hiding information; on the other hand, it might merely represent a comfortable or habitual posture without bearing on truthfulness. Without further contextual information, each observable behavior could be interpreted in ways supporting either honesty or deception, underscoring the importance of integrating these cues with additional evidence for a more accurate assessment.

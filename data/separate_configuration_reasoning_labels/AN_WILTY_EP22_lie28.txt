The person's frowning eyebrows may suggest concentration or concern, which in some contexts could be interpreted as a sign of distress associated with deception. Conversely, this expression might simply indicate genuine confusion or deep thought, reflecting honest engagement with the topic at hand. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor also lends itself to dual interpretations; maintaining eye contact can be a deliberate effort to establish trust and credibility, yet it might equally be a conscious attempt to appear convincing while fabricating information. Meanwhile, the head shaking can be read as a nonverbal cue of disagreement or denial, potentially revealing an effort to reject scrutiny or discomfort when confronted with challenging questions. On the other hand, the same gesture might be an authentic response to something the interlocutor said or a habitual mannerism unrelated to deceit. In all, these behaviors alone cannot definitively indicate truthfulness or deception without further contextual information and a holistic understanding of the individual's baseline demeanor.

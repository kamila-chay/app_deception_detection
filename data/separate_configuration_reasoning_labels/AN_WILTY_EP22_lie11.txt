The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often suggests engagement and honesty, as individuals typically look at others to establish trust and demonstrate openness. Conversely, maintaining gaze might also be a strategic effort to appear truthful, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to mask deceit. Similarly, their nodding could be seen as a sign of active listening and agreement, reinforcing the notion that they are genuinely engaged and responsive. However, nodding may also serve as a deceptive tactic to create an illusion of sincerity and encourage the interlocutor’s confidence, even if the underlying information is untrue. The head tilting behavior further complicates interpretation. It might indicate curiosity, empathy, or openness, behaviors consistent with honesty and willingness to communicate transparently. Alternatively, head tilting can be a self-soothing gesture that individuals employ when feeling uncertain or under stress, which may be associated with deceptive behavior as they internally manage the discomfort of fabricating or concealing information. Without additional context, these behaviors remain ambiguous; they could equally signal truthfulness or calculated attempts to deceive depending on the broader conversational and emotional environment.

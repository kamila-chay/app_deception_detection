The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor generally suggests engagement and willingness to communicate openly, which could be interpreted as a sign of honesty. However, the occasional upward gaze might indicate they are accessing internal thoughts or retrieving memories, but it could also suggest they are constructing a narrative, possibly indicating deception. Similarly, their sideways glances might be read as attempts to avoid direct confrontation or scrutinizing reactions, hinting at discomfort or concealment; conversely, these glances might reflect normal social cognition or momentary distractions rather than deceit.

Their nodding could signal agreement and cooperation, reinforcing perceptions of truthfulness, yet in some contexts, nodding might be a strategic behavior designed to appear agreeable and deflect suspicion. The opposed gesture of head shaking might imply disagreement or doubt, potentially demonstrating transparency about inconsistencies or a refusal to accept falsehoods; alternatively, it might serve as a defensive mechanism to deny accusations, which could be indicative of dishonesty.

Open palms and arms suggest a posture of openness and vulnerability, which often aligns with sincerity and willingness to share information truthfully. On the other hand, these gestures can be consciously employed to foster trust, functioning as deliberate signals to mask deceitful intentions. Ultimately, without additional context such as verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors, these visible cues alone cannot definitively determine the subject’s truthfulness or deception but rather offer a complex interplay of possible interpretations.

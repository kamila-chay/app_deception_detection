The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signal genuine surprise or interest, indicating engagement and honesty in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a deliberate attempt to feign innocence or deflect suspicion, which could hint at deceptive behavior depending on the context. The retraction of the lips similarly presents dual interpretations. It might reflect tension or discomfort associated with fabricating information, suggesting a possible effort to mask the truth. Alternatively, this expression could simply be a natural response to stress or concentration, without any underlying intent to deceive.

Their gaze behavior also offers contrasting perspectives. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor might be seen as a sign of openness and truthfulness, as individuals often avoid direct eye contact when being deceptive. However, persistent gaze can also be consciously employed to create an appearance of sincerity, potentially serving as a tactic to manipulate perception. The moments when the subject looks down add another layer of ambiguity. Looking downward is often associated with hesitancy or internal conflict, which might be indicative of deceit. Yet, it could equally represent thoughtfulness or an attempt to recall specific details accurately, underscoring that this behavior alone is not conclusive.

Ultimately, while each of these behaviors—raised eyebrows, lip retraction, alternating gaze toward the interlocutor and downward—can be linked to both truthful and deceptive states, the broader context, including verbal cues and situational factors, must be considered to form a more definitive assessment.

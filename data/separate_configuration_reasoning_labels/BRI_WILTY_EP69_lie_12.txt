The individual’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, suggesting they are being truthful. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a subtle cue of feigned astonishment or an effort to manipulate the interlocutor, which might hint at deception, especially if it seems exaggerated or out of context. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor further complicates the interpretation. Maintaining eye contact often reflects confidence and sincerity, reinforcing the possibility that the person is forthcoming. However, in some cases, deliberate and sustained eye contact can be a conscious strategy to appear honest while concealing deceit. The intermittent sideways glances contribute additional ambiguity. These glances might indicate the person is thoughtfully recalling information or naturally scanning their environment, which aligns with truthfulness. Alternatively, such gaze aversions can be associated with discomfort or cognitive load, potentially pointing to the mental effort involved in fabricating a story. Ultimately, without broader contextual information—such as the person’s baseline behavior, the situation’s stress level, and verbal content—it is challenging to definitively classify these behaviors as indicative of truthfulness or deception. Each observed cue holds a dual potential and should be weighed carefully within the overall communicative framework.

The subject’s raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which might support the notion that they are being truthful. Conversely, this same gesture could be a subtle signal of disbelief or an effort to feign openness, potentially indicating deceptive intent. Their lip corners alternately turning up and down adds complexity to the interpretation: a slight smile might convey friendliness and comfort, aligning with honesty, while the downward movement could reflect tension or discomfort, possibly hinting at concealment. The gaze directed toward the interlocutor typically fosters trust and indicates engagement, suggesting a genuine interaction; however, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear confident and credible, masking underlying deceit. Conversely, moments when the gaze shifts upward may be interpreted as a cognitive attempt to retrieve memories or process information, reinforcing truthfulness, yet such gaze aversion can also be a classic sign of evasion or fabrication. Ultimately, these behaviors in isolation are ambiguous, and their significance hinges on the broader context of the interaction and baseline behavior of the individual, underscoring the need for a holistic assessment before drawing conclusions about veracity.

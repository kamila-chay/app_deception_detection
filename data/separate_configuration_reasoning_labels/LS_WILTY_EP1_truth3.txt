The subject’s raised eyebrows and exaggerated eye opening could suggest an attempt to appear more sincere or surprised, potentially signaling that they are trying to convince their audience of their honesty. However, such expressions might also be natural reactions or simply part of their communicative style, with no deceptive intent. Similarly, the slight upward curve of the lip corners may indicate genuine friendliness or positivity, yet in a different context, it could be a controlled smile intended to mask true feelings or discomfort. Their gaze direction presents an interesting duality: looking downward might reflect avoidance or discomfort associated with deception, but it could equally be a sign of introspection or careful thought. Likewise, frequent sideways glances could be interpreted as evasiveness or searching for fabricated details, yet they could just as well represent attempts to recall information or process questions thoughtfully. Finally, the openness of their arms might express transparency and openness, signaling honesty, but depending on the broader context, it could be a strategic posture meant to project confidence and distract from potential falsehoods. Without additional context or baseline behavioral information, these cues remain ambiguous, making it essential to consider the overall interaction and other evidence before drawing conclusions about whether the subject is being truthful or deceptive.

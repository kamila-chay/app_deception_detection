The subject is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness in their communication, potentially reinforcing the credibility of their statements. Conversely, the same gesture could also be a subtle signal of anxiety or uncertainty, possibly reflecting discomfort associated with fabricating or concealing information.

Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor adds another layer to the interpretation. Maintaining eye contact is often seen as a sign of confidence and truthfulness, suggesting engagement and sincerity in the conversation. However, sustained gaze can also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, using eye contact to distract or manipulate the listener’s perception.

The instances of the subject looking upwards can similarly have dual meanings. Looking upward may be linked to recalling memories or visualizing details, which supports the idea that the person is retrieving genuine information. Alternatively, it might indicate constructed or imagined scenarios, as some theories suggest upward gaze can signal fabrication or cognitive construction of falsehoods.

By contrast, moments when the individual looks down can be suggestive of shame, guilt, or discomfort that might arise from deceptive behavior. Yet, such downward gaze might also simply stem from introspection, thoughtfulness, or cultural communication norms that do not imply deception at all.

Ultimately, these behaviors—raising eyebrows, shifting gaze between the interlocutor, upward, and downward—hold ambiguous meanings that require careful consideration of the overall context, content of communication, and baseline behaviors before drawing conclusions about veracity.

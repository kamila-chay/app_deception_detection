The subject is displaying frowning eyebrows, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest concentration or discomfort, possibly indicating that they are struggling to maintain a fabricated narrative or feeling uneasy about the topic at hand. Conversely, frowning could simply reflect genuine concern or confusion about the conversation, signaling honest engagement rather than deception.

Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing downward. Maintaining eye contact might be seen as a sign of sincerity and openness, as deceptive individuals often avoid direct gaze to hide dishonesty. Alternatively, sustained eye contact could be a deliberate effort to appear truthful and mask underlying deceit. Meanwhile, the downward gaze might imply evasion or discomfort associated with concealing information, but it could just as well indicate introspection or the process of recalling memories, which requires momentary distraction from the interlocutor’s eyes.

These behaviors on their own do not definitively point to truthfulness or deception; rather, their interpretation depends heavily on additional context such as baseline behavior, the subject’s personality traits, and the nature of the conversation. Without that broader perspective, these cues remain ambiguous and warrant cautious, nuanced consideration.

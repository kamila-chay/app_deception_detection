The subject’s scowl and downturned lip corners could be interpreted as signs of distress or discomfort, potentially indicating that they are struggling with the truth or feeling guilty about something they wish to conceal. Conversely, these expressions might simply reflect concentration or dissatisfaction unrelated to deception, such as frustration with the situation or the interlocutor. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might suggest confidence and transparency, implying honesty and a willingness to engage openly. However, maintaining steady eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy used by deceivers to appear credible and to mask their deceit. The subtle head tilting could be read as a sign of engagement and curiosity, indicating that the subject is genuinely interested and involved in the conversation, which might lend credibility to their statements. On the other hand, this gesture could be a calculated tactic to appear more empathetic or attentive, potentially designed to disarm suspicion. Additionally, folding arms is often associated with defensiveness or closed-off body language, which might hint at emotional barrier or resistance to fully opening up—possibly consistent with deceptive behavior. But it could equally represent a comfortable resting position or a natural response to feeling cold or physically protected posturing, rather than an intentional signal of deceit. Ultimately, understanding whether these behaviors indicate truthfulness or deception depends heavily on the broader context, including the subject’s baseline behavior and the circumstances surrounding the interaction.

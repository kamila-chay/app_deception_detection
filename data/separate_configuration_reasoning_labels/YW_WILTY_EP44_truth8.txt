The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted as a sign of surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating an attempt to convey sincerity and openness. Conversely, raised eyebrows may also signal discomfort or an effort to feign innocence, especially if inconsistent with the overall facial expression. Frequent blinking might suggest nervousness or stress, which could be a marker of deceptive behavior. However, it can equally be a natural physiological response to anxiety or environmental factors such as lighting or dryness, unrelated to dishonesty.

Their lip corners turned upwards might reflect a genuine smile, signaling warmth and truthfulness, aiding in building rapport with the interlocutor. Yet, this expression could also be a controlled or forced smile, used to mask true intentions or manipulate perception. The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor usually indicates engagement and openness, suggesting honest communication. On the other hand, the occurrence of sideways glances might point toward discomfort, possible evasion, or internal conflict typical in deceptive responses, but it can also be indicative of cognitive processing or attempts to recall information.

Head tilting often conveys curiosity or empathy, potentially reinforcing the subject’s truthfulness by showing attentiveness and interest. In a different context, such gestures could be employed to distract or appear more amicable while concealing deceitful motives. Finally, the subject’s palms held up might symbolize openness and honesty, reinforcing an image of transparency. However, this gesture can also be a strategic display aimed at deflecting suspicion or eliciting trust artificially. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader contextual cues to make a more accurate assessment of the subject’s veracity.

The person’s gaze towards the interlocutor could be seen as a sign of engagement and sincerity, suggesting they are open and truthful in the conversation. Maintaining eye contact often conveys confidence and a willingness to connect genuinely. Conversely, this direct gaze might also be a strategic attempt to appear credible, as some individuals consciously use steady eye contact to mask deception. The sideways glances, on the other hand, might indicate discomfort or evasiveness, which could hint at an effort to avoid revealing certain information or conceal dishonesty. Yet, these same sideways looks could merely reflect the person’s natural thinking process, as people often glance away when trying to recall memories or organize their thoughts. The nodding behavior is similarly ambiguous; it can be interpreted as a genuine sign of agreement and active listening, reinforcing the idea that the individual is truthful and engaged. Alternatively, nodding might serve as a social cue or a rehearsed pattern intended to persuade or placate the interlocutor, which could arise in a deceptive context. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues, each of these behaviors can plausibly support both truthfulness and deception, emphasizing the need for a holistic assessment beyond isolated nonverbal signals.

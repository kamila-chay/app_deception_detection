The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted as a spontaneous reaction indicative of surprise or emphasis, potentially supporting the notion of honesty in their communication. Conversely, this same expression might be strategically employed to feign sincerity or to mask discomfort, suggesting a level of deceit. Their chin moving upwards may convey confidence and assertiveness, which can reinforce the impression of truthfulness. However, it might also reflect defensiveness or an attempt to project dominance, characteristics sometimes associated with evasiveness.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor typically signals engagement and sincerity, yet moments of gaze directed sideways introduce ambiguity. These sideways glances could imply attempts to access memories or organize thoughts, consistent with truthful recall. Alternatively, they might be a sign of avoidance or attempts to fabricate details, which could point to deception. The presence of head tilting often indicates openness and a willingness to listen, qualities aligning with honesty. Nevertheless, it might also be a subtle cue of uncertainty or discomfort, potentially linked to deceptive behavior.

The subject’s hands scratching or touching various parts of their head or body may reveal nervousness, possibly stemming from withholding information or constructing a false narrative. On the other hand, these gestures can simply be habitual or responses to external stimuli, such as an itch or stress unrelated to deception. Ultimately, these behaviors must be interpreted within a broader context to draw more reliable conclusions, as each could signify genuine emotional states or be part of a complex effort to deceive.

The subject’s facial expressions and body language exhibit a mix of cues that could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. For instance, their raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or emphasis, which could indicate genuine engagement and honesty. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or disbelief, potentially signaling deception. Their chin movements add another layer of complexity; a chin lifted upwards may convey confidence and openness, yet in some contexts, it might also be perceived as a defensive gesture, possibly masking discomfort or deceit. Similarly, the downward movement of the chin could reflect thoughtfulness or modesty, but alternatively, it could signal submission or an attempt to hide emotions.

Regarding their gaze patterns, maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor often reflects honesty and a willingness to communicate openly. However, intense or prolonged gaze can sometimes be a calculated effort to persuade or manipulate. On the other hand, sideways glances may be interpreted as signs of distraction or nervousness, which can indicate deception, but they could just as easily suggest that the person is thoughtfully recalling information or processing questions. Their nodding might indicate agreement and affirmation, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness; yet, excessive or mechanical nodding can also be a strategy to appear cooperative and convince others, irrespective of the truth. Lastly, the side-turn of the head can demonstrate engagement and interest, yet it might also be a subtle attempt to create distance or mask discomfort.

Ultimately, these behaviors, while suggestive, do not definitively point to either truthfulness or deception on their own. A more reliable assessment would require considering additional verbal and contextual cues to better understand the subject’s intent.

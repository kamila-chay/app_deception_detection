The subject’s exaggerated eye opening may suggest an attempt to emphasize sincerity or surprise, potentially indicating that they are trying to convince the viewer of their honesty. However, such an exaggerated gesture could just as easily be a sign of overcompensation, where the person is consciously attempting to appear truthful while potentially hiding something. The upward movement of the chin might be interpreted as a display of confidence and assertiveness, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. Conversely, this same gesture could be perceived as a defensive posture or an effort to project dominance, which sometimes occurs when a person is uncomfortable or being deceptive.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be seen as a sign of engagement and openness, conveying that the person is frank and forthcoming. Yet, steady eye contact can also be employed deliberately to mask deceit by trying to appear trustworthy, making it a double-edged cue when considered in isolation. The head shaking might indicate genuine disagreement or denial, reinforcing the idea that the subject is honest about their stance. On the other hand, head shaking might be an unconscious defensive mechanism to reject accusations or deflect suspicion, which could imply that the person is concealing the truth.

The frequent covering of the face or mouth with hands often raises suspicion, as it can signal discomfort or an attempt to inhibit unintentional facial expressions that might betray deceit. Still, this behavior might also be a natural response to stress or self-soothing during intense conversation, rather than an indicator of falsehood. Finally, the open position of the arms can be interpreted as a welcoming and open attitude that aligns with honesty and transparency. Conversely, such openness might be a strategic display designed to build rapport and lower the interlocutor’s guard, potentially masking deceptive intent.

In sum, while each of these behaviors offers clues that could point toward either truthfulness or deception, none should be taken in isolation. The broader context and baseline behaviors are essential to accurately interpret the subject’s intentions and reliability.

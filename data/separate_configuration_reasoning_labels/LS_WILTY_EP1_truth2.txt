The individual’s frowning eyebrows and downturn of the lip corners might be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, these expressions could suggest discomfort or distress often associated with deception, possibly reflecting internal conflict or the cognitive load of fabricating information. Conversely, such facial cues might also simply indicate genuine confusion, concern, or frustration related to the topic under discussion, rather than any intent to deceive. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor similarly lends itself to contrasting interpretations. Maintaining eye contact could be a conscious effort to appear sincere and truthful, projecting confidence and openness. Alternatively, it could be a deliberate strategy to mask dishonesty, as some individuals believe sustained eye contact enhances credibility, even if they are withholding or distorting the truth.

The subtle head tilting they exhibit might serve as an expression of empathy or engagement, signaling active listening and a willingness to connect, which supports a truthful interaction. Yet, this gesture could also be a cover-up for discomfort or an attempt to deflect suspicion by appearing non-threatening and cooperative. The openness of their arms might communicate transparency and an absence of defensive barriers, reinforcing the impression of honesty. On the flip side, open arms could be employed as a façade to minimize perceived deceit, consciously crafted to put the listener at ease despite underlying deceitfulness.

Finally, the shrugging movement adds an additional layer of ambiguity. It might be a genuine admission of uncertainty or lack of knowledge, which aligns with truthful communication. However, it could just as plausibly be interpreted as evasiveness or an unwillingness to provide clear answers, typical behaviors when someone is attempting to obfuscate or avoid accountability. Given these dual possibilities, it is essential to consider the broader context—such as the subject matter, baseline behaviors, and verbal content—to draw a more informed and reliable conclusion about the individual’s truthfulness.

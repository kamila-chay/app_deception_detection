The individual’s smile might initially suggest a genuine, positive engagement, often interpreted as a sign of honesty and openness. However, smiles can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or insincerity, serving as a social lubricant to deflect suspicion. The act of raising eyebrows could indicate surprise or a desire to emphasize truthfulness, yet it might also be a subconscious reaction to stress or an attempt to persuade through exaggerated expressions. Their gaze directed downwards can be seen as a moment of reflection or modesty, common when someone is thoughtfully recalling information or feeling vulnerable, but alternatively, it may signal avoidance or concealment associated with deceptive behavior. Similarly, the sideways gaze might reveal distraction or an attempt to access memories from different cognitive pathways, which could be part of genuine recall, yet it might also reflect evasiveness or a search for nonverbal cues to support a fabricated narrative. Ultimately, these behaviors require consideration within the broader interaction context to discern whether they align more with truthful communication or with deliberate deception.

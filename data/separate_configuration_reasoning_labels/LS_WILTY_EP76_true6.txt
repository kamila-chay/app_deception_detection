The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, direct eye contact might suggest confidence and sincerity, indicating that the person is engaged and truthful in the conversation. Maintaining eye contact can be a way to demonstrate openness and credibility, lending support to the idea that they have nothing to hide. Conversely, sustained gaze toward the interlocutor could also be a deliberate attempt to mask dishonesty, using eye contact to appear transparent while internally fabricating or withholding information. In some cases, individuals may overcompensate with intense eye contact precisely to avoid suspicion, which can be a subtle red flag.

At the same time, the subject’s occasional gaze directed downward introduces another layer of ambiguity. Looking down may be interpreted as a sign of nervousness or discomfort often associated with deceptive behavior, potentially reflecting an internal struggle with guilt or the cognitive effort of constructing a false narrative. Alternatively, this downward glance could be a natural response reflecting thoughtfulness, introspection, or even cultural norms about eye contact. It may indicate that the person is simply concentrating, recalling information, or feeling modest rather than deceitful.

In sum, both the direct gaze and downward look can be read in supportive or critical ways depending on the broader context of the interaction, the individual’s baseline behavior, and additional verbal and nonverbal cues. Without further information, these behaviors alone do not definitively signal truthfulness or deception, underscoring the need for a holistic assessment to form a more reliable conclusion.

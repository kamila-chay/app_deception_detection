The subject’s lips are protruded, which can sometimes be interpreted as a subtle sign of tension or controlled emotion, potentially indicative of someone trying to mask discomfort or unease associated with deception. However, this same behavior might simply reflect concentration or habitual facial expression without any underlying intent to deceive. Their chin moves upward intermittently, a gesture that in some contexts might signal defensiveness or an attempt to assert control, possibly suggesting they are managing their posture to appear more confident while fabricating information. Conversely, this upward movement could merely be a natural, unconscious adjustment in response to the physical environment or conversational dynamics, not necessarily linked to dishonesty.

The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which is often viewed as a sign of openness and engagement, implying a willingness to communicate truthfully. Nevertheless, sustained eye contact might also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and mask deceptive intent, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to gain trust. At times, their gaze shifts downward, behavior that could hint at discomfort or evasion typically associated with withholding information. On the other hand, glancing down might simply reflect momentary reflection, processing of thoughts, or cultural communication styles, rather than an effort to conceal truth.

Observing the head movements, a forward motion can be a sign of engagement and active participation, supporting the impression of sincerity. Yet, leaning forward could also be interpreted as invasive or as an attempt to dominate the interaction, which some might do to distract from uncertain or deceptive answers. When the head moves backward, it may indicate withdrawal or defensiveness, possibly signaling the person’s subtle attempt to create psychological distance during stressful questioning. Conversely, this backward movement might just be a physical response to discomfort, fatigue, or personal space preferences, unrelated to deceit. The side-turn of the head introduces ambiguity as well; it can be seen as an avoidance gesture, hinting at reluctance or concealment, while equally being a natural or habitual behavior, perhaps reflecting the person’s thinking process or social interaction style.

Ultimately, these behaviors individually and collectively can point toward either truthfulness or deception, underscoring the importance of context, baseline behavior, and additional verbal and nonverbal cues to arrive at a more accurate assessment.

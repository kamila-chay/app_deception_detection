The subject exhibits frequent blinking, which can be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, increased blinking might suggest discomfort or anxiety often associated with deceptive behavior, as the individual could be trying to mask their true feelings. On the other hand, frequent blinking may simply reflect natural physiological responses such as eye dryness or stress unrelated to deception, indicating nothing more than a momentary lapse in comfort.

Their chin moving upwards could signal a defensive or evasive posture, potentially hinting at an attempt to distance themselves from the conversation or to assert control in a subtle way. However, this same gesture might also be a sign of confidence or engagement, reflecting genuine interest rather than concealment, depending on cultural and situational factors.

The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor generally denotes attentiveness and openness, possibly reinforcing sincerity. Yet, this direct eye contact could alternatively be a deliberate effort to overcompensate for dishonesty, as individuals who are deceptive sometimes try to maintain strong eye contact to appear convincing. Conversely, the intermittent sideways glance adds complexity; it might indicate evasiveness or discomfort, or it could simply represent moments of thoughtfulness or distraction as the person processes information.

Head movements, such as tilting and side-turning, offer further ambiguous cues. A head tilt can be interpreted as a sign of curiosity or empathy, suggesting an honest and engaged demeanor. Alternatively, it might be a subtle tactic used to gauge the interviewer’s reactions or to create a sense of rapport while masking insincerity. The side-turn of the head could reflect hesitation or a desire to withdraw, hinting at reluctance to fully disclose information. Conversely, it might just be a comfortable adjustment in posture or an effort to better hear or understand the interlocutor.

Finally, the head shaking might indicate disagreement or discomfort, potentially arising from internal conflict when someone is not being truthful. Conversely, it could simply express genuine disbelief or a natural reaction to the conversation, unrelated to deceit. Given these varied interpretations, it is essential to consider the broader context, including baseline behavior, verbal content, and situational factors, before drawing any conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

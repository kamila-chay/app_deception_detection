The person’s gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways, can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and a willingness to engage openly, which often aligns with truthful communication. Conversely, prolonged or intense gaze can sometimes be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate, potentially signaling deception. Meanwhile, the occasional sideways glances could indicate avoidance or discomfort, possibly hinting at evasion or concealment of information. However, such glances might also simply reflect the person’s natural thought process, as people often look away briefly when trying to recall or organize their thoughts. Given these behaviors, it is important to consider additional cues and contextual details before drawing any conclusions about the person’s truthfulness or deceptiveness.

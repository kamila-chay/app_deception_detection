The individual’s action of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or heightened alertness, which could be consistent with someone reacting genuinely to questions or topics they find unexpected. Conversely, this behavior might also be a deliberate attempt to feign innocence or emphasize sincerity, potentially masking discomfort or deception. When considering their gaze directed toward the interlocutor, it may suggest openness and engagement, indicative of someone who is being honest and attentive during the interaction. However, sustained eye contact can also be a strategic behavior employed by a deceptive person to appear confident and trustworthy, attempting to preempt suspicion. The gaze shifting upwards adds another layer of complexity; looking up is often associated with trying to retrieve memories or visualize information, which could imply the person is actively recalling truthful details. Alternatively, this upward gaze may be a cognitive effort to fabricate or construct a response, signaling possible deceit. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors heavily relies on the broader interpersonal context and baseline behavioral patterns, underscoring the importance of considering additional cues and circumstances before forming a definitive judgment on the person’s veracity.

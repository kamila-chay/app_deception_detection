The subject’s closed mouth combined with protruded lips may be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, such a gesture could suggest an attempt to withhold information or suppress a response, possibly indicating caution or deception. Conversely, it might simply reflect concentration or thoughtfulness, as individuals often purse their lips when carefully considering their words. The upward movement of the chin can also be viewed through different lenses. It might signal defensiveness or an effort to assert confidence, potentially masking insecurity or dishonesty. Alternatively, this movement could be a natural posture adjustment or an expression of self-assurance influenced by the context of the conversation.

Their gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways, is equally ambiguous. Direct eye contact might be a sign of openness and truthfulness, aiming to convey sincerity. Yet, sustained or forced eye contact can sometimes serve as a strategy to convince or manipulate. The sideways glances might indicate evasiveness or discomfort associated with deception, but they could also reflect the cognitive process involved in recalling information or responding thoughtfully. Meanwhile, the open positioning of the arms typically suggests a willingness to engage and transparency, which could support an interpretation of honesty. However, open arms might also be a rehearsed or unconscious attempt to appear non-threatening and cooperatively mask true intentions.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors—mouth positioning, chin movement, gaze patterns, and arm posture—holds potential meanings that can support either truthful or deceptive interpretations. Without further contextual information or baseline behavioral data, it remains challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the subject’s veracity.

The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be interpreted as genuine expressions of positive emotion and engagement, suggesting truthfulness and comfort in the interaction. Conversely, these same facial cues might be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to create a deceptive appearance of sincerity. The raised eyebrows, often indicative of surprise or openness, might support an honest response or, alternatively, could be an unconscious attempt to feign innocence or emphasize a fabricated claim.

Their chin moving upwards is another behavior that can carry dual meanings. It might reflect confidence and assertiveness that accompanies truthful statements, yet it could also be understood as a defensive posture or an effort to project dominance in a situation where deception is involved. Regarding gaze behavior, direct eye contact towards the interlocutor typically signals attentiveness and honesty, but in some cases, it may be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate. On the other hand, gazes directed upwards and sideways could imply moments of cognitive processing or recalling information, consistent with truthful recollection, or they might suggest evasiveness and an internal search for fabricated details to support a lie.

Given these mixed signals, it is critical to consider the broader context and additional behavioral indicators before drawing conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness or deception. Each observed behavior can carry multiple interpretations depending on the nuances of the situation and individual differences.

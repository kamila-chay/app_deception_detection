The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor may suggest engagement and sincerity, as maintaining eye contact is often associated with honesty and openness. Conversely, this same behavior could also be a deliberate attempt to appear trustworthy and mask deceit, especially if the gaze feels overly intense or unnatural in the given context. When the subject looks down, it might indicate discomfort or introspection, potentially signaling evasion or hesitancy to confront the topic directly. On the other hand, looking down can also be a natural response when someone is thoughtfully considering their words or recalling information, rather than an indicator of deceit.

Their nodding could be interpreted as a sign of agreement and cooperation, reinforcing their truthfulness by signaling understanding and alignment with the conversation. However, nodding might also be used strategically to placate the interlocutor or to feign agreement while withholding complete honesty. The gesture of palms up is often seen as a sign of openness and honesty, conveying a non-threatening and sincere attitude. Yet, this same gesture could be employed as a calculated display to manipulate perceptions, suggesting submission or candor even when the person is being deceptive.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors—gaze patterns, nodding, and hand gestures—can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending heavily on the broader interaction, the individual’s baseline behavior, and contextual factors. Without additional information, it remains equally plausible that these signals reflect genuine truthfulness or, alternatively, carefully managed attempts to conceal deception.

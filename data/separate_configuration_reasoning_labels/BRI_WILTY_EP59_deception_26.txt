The person's gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often suggests honesty and engagement, as it can indicate a willingness to be open and transparent. Conversely, sustained gaze might also be a deliberate tactic to appear sincere, potentially masking deception by trying to convince the listener through exaggerated attentiveness. Meanwhile, the moments when the person looks upward can also carry ambiguous meaning. This upward gaze might reflect genuine cognitive effort, such as recalling specific details or searching memory, which aligns with truthful recollection. However, it can equally be viewed as a sign of fabrication, where the individual purposefully avoids direct eye contact to construct or adjust their narrative. Each of these behaviors, therefore, may serve as cues for both honesty and deceit depending on the broader context—such as the person’s baseline behavior, the nature of the conversation, and other nonverbal signals. Without additional information or consistent behavioral patterns, these cues alone are insufficient to definitively conclude whether the person is being truthful or deceptive.

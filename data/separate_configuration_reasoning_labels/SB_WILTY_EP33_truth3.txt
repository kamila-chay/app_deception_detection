The subject’s raised eyebrows could signal surprise or disbelief, which might suggest they are reacting to unexpected information, potentially indicative of fabricating or concealing the truth. Conversely, raised eyebrows may simply reflect genuine interest or attentiveness, indicating engagement rather than deception. Their closed mouth and protruded lips might be interpreted as efforts to control speech or withhold information, possibly pointing to deliberate suppression of truths. However, these same gestures could be habitual or a natural resting facial expression, unrelated to any intent to deceive. Similarly, the retraction of lips might suggest tension or stress commonly associated with deceit, yet it could equally be an unconscious reaction to discomfort or concentration without any deceptive motive.

The subject’s gaze behavior presents an intriguing duality. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor may imply confidence and honesty, as deceptive individuals often avoid direct gaze. On the other hand, sustained eye contact can also be a conscious strategy to appear truthful and manipulate perception. Meanwhile, looking down could be indicative of evasiveness or guilt often linked to deceit, though it might also simply reflect contemplation, shyness, or cultural communication norms. Their head movements, including tilting and side-turning, can be perceived as signs of openness or curiosity, which generally correlate with sincerity. Alternatively, such movements might be employed to create ambiguity or discomfort, potentially masking dishonest intentions.

The subject’s arms crossed position is another behavior with ambiguous interpretations. It could denote defensiveness or self-protection, hinting at emotional barriers possibly put up by someone engaging in deception. At the same time, crossed arms might just represent a comfortable or habitual stance unrelated to trustworthiness. Without further contextual information—such as the subject’s baseline behaviors, the nature of the conversation, or cultural factors—these observations remain open to multiple interpretations. A comprehensive assessment would necessitate integrating these behavioral cues with additional verbal and situational insights to more reliably discern truthfulness or deception.

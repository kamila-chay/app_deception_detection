The individual's gaze directed toward the interlocutor can be viewed from two contrasting perspectives. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may signal confidence and honesty, suggesting they are fully engaged and willing to communicate openly. Conversely, sustained gaze might also be a deliberate effort to appear truthful or to mask discomfort, potentially indicating an attempt to control the impression they give. The moments when their gaze shifts downward introduce similar ambiguity. This behavior could reflect moments of genuine reflection or thoughtfulness as they process information. Alternatively, looking down might signal avoidance or discomfort stemming from fabricating information or concealing the truth. Their head turning to the side can also be interpreted in multiple ways; it might indicate a relaxed and natural conversational posture or a momentary distraction, which would be consistent with truthful engagement. However, it could equally suggest evasiveness or an unconscious attempt to distance themselves from the topic or the interlocutor, which might be indicative of deception. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors depends heavily on the broader context, baseline behavior, and additional cues, making it essential to consider the full picture before drawing conclusions about their truthfulness.

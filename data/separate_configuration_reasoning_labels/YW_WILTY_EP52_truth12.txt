The subject's behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an instinctive reaction to fabricating information, potentially reflecting a momentary struggle to maintain a deceptive narrative. Conversely, such a gesture might simply convey genuine interest or attentiveness during the interaction, especially if it aligns with the natural flow of conversation. Similarly, the alternating expressions of lip corners turning both up and down present a complex picture. A smile reflected by lip corners turning up might be a calculated attempt to appear sincere and trustworthy while masking deceit. Alternatively, a genuine smile could be naturally expressed during comfortable and truthful exchanges. Conversely, lip corners turning down could indicate discomfort or unease, which might be symptomatic of deception; yet, it could equally represent concern, thoughtfulness, or simply an emotional response to the topic under discussion.

The subject’s chin moving upwards can also be viewed through divergent lenses. This upward motion might represent a defensive posture, as if preparing to contradict or conceal information, hinting at possible dishonesty. On the other hand, it may just be a sign of confidence or assertiveness when articulating their position, consistent with truthful communication. The gaze behavior adds further nuance. Direct gaze toward the interlocutor might suggest openness and honesty, fostering trust between participants. However, sustained eye contact can also be employed deliberately to persuade or mask deceit. In contrast, the gaze shifting downwards might reflect evasiveness or discomfort linked to deception, but it could equally denote introspection or efforts to recall accurate details from memory.

Altogether, these behaviors offer mixed signals that can be construed as either supportive of truthfulness or indicative of deception, contingent largely on the broader context, the subject’s baseline demeanor, and the situational dynamics. Without additional information, drawing definitive conclusions remains challenging, underscoring the importance of integrating behavioral observations with other evidence for a more reliable assessment.

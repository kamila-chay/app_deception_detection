The individual maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, sustained eye contact may suggest confidence and sincerity, indicating that they have nothing to hide and are fully engaged in the conversation. On the other hand, it is also possible that deliberate eye contact is being used as a strategy to convince or distract, employed consciously to mask deception or uncertainty. Their nodding accompanies the gaze, which might reflect genuine agreement and active listening, reinforcing the impression of openness and honesty. Conversely, nodding could be a rehearsed or automatic gesture intended to simulate cooperation and prompt trust in the listener, even if the content of their speech is less than truthful. Finally, the openness of their arms is another behavior open to interpretation. Open arms frequently signify receptivity and transparency, gestures aligned with truthfulness and a lack of defensiveness. Yet, it is also conceivable that this posture is adopted intentionally to project warmth and create a false sense of ease, thereby concealing the person’s true intentions or feelings. Ultimately, these behaviors should be understood within the broader context of verbal cues, baseline habits, and situational factors to form a more informed judgment about the person’s veracity.

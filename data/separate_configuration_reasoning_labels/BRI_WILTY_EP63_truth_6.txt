The subject’s hands scratching can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, this behavior might be a sign of underlying nervousness or discomfort commonly associated with attempts to conceal information or fabricate a story. Scratching could serve as a subtle, involuntary displacement activity, helping to relieve tension caused by the cognitive load of lying. On the other hand, this action might simply reflect an innocent physical irritation, such as an itch, dryness, or an allergic reaction, and may have no connection to the truthfulness of their statements. Without knowing the broader context—including the person's baseline behaviors, environmental factors, and emotional state—it remains ambiguous whether the scratching is a genuine physiological response or a manifestation of psychological stress linked to deception. Thus, while scratching hands could point towards concealed anxiety, it equally might be an innocuous, natural gesture unrelated to honesty.

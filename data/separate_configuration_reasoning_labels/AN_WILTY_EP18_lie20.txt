The individual’s smile and raised eyebrows might suggest friendliness and openness, which could be interpreted as signs of truthfulness, reflecting genuine engagement in the interaction. However, these same behaviors could also be strategic, employed to mask deception by projecting a convincing and pleasant demeanor. The upward movement of the lip corners similarly might denote sincere positive emotion, indicating comfort and honesty, but equally, it might be a controlled expression meant to create an illusion of sincerity.

Their gaze behaviors present a nuanced picture as well. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor often signals confidence and directness, traits commonly associated with honesty. Conversely, a sustained gaze could be deliberately maintained to avoid suspicion, serving as a calculated tactic to distract or reassure the listener. The moments when the individual’s gaze shifts downward could be interpreted as signs of discomfort or the mental effort involved in fabricating or withholding information. On the other hand, such glances might simply reflect normal cognitive processing or even modesty, rather than deception.

The side-turning of the head introduces further complexity. This gesture might indicate evasiveness or an attempt to physically distance oneself from uncomfortable truths, hinting at possible dishonesty. Alternatively, it could be a natural, relaxed posture or a response to environmental cues, unrelated to any deceptive intent. In essence, while these behaviors individually might suggest different motivations, their meanings are heavily dependent on the broader context, baseline behavior, and the interaction’s specifics. Only by integrating these factors can one approach a more definitive assessment of truthfulness or deceit.

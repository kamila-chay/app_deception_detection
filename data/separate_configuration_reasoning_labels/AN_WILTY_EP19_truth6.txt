The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor may be interpreted in multiple ways when considering potential deception. On one hand, sustained eye contact can be a sign of honesty and confidence, suggesting that the person is engaged and transparent in the conversation. It may indicate a desire to establish trust and openness, reinforcing the credibility of their statements. On the other hand, deliberate and intense eye contact might also be a conscious effort to mask deceit, as some individuals believe maintaining steady gaze can prevent suspicion and convey sincerity, even when they are not truthful. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this gaze reflects genuine engagement or a calculated tactic to persuade.

Similarly, the person’s posture with arms open can be viewed through contrasting lenses. Open arms are traditionally seen as a welcoming and non-threatening gesture that signals receptiveness and honesty, contributing to an impression of openness and willingness to communicate freely. This behavior could therefore support the idea that the individual is being truthful and transparent. Conversely, open arms may also serve as a strategic posture to seem approachable and relaxed while potentially concealing internal tension or deceitful intent. It could act as a way to disarm suspicion, signaling vulnerability on the surface while the person internally manages discomfort or evasiveness.

In sum, both gaze towards the interlocutor and open arm posture can be indicative of either truthful engagement or deliberate attempts to appear credible while hiding deception. The interpretation of these behaviors hinges on the broader context of the interaction, including the individual’s baseline behavior, speech content, and emotional cues, which are essential for making a more informed and balanced judgment.

The subject’s raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, potentially signaling openness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, this same expression could be interpreted as a subtle sign of deception, as raised eyebrows sometimes accompany fabricated statements to elicit trust or distract from dishonesty. Their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor may reflect confidence and straightforwardness, implying transparency and sincerity in their communication. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to control the interaction and mask deceit. The occasional gaze sideways introduces further complexity; such behavior might indicate discomfort or an effort to fabricate information by seeking mental cues or cues from the environment. On the other hand, these sideways glances could simply be moments of natural thought processing or lapses in attention, unrelated to deceptive intent. Ultimately, whether these behaviors suggest truthfulness or deception heavily depends on the broader conversational context, baseline behavioral patterns, and the subject’s typical mannerisms.

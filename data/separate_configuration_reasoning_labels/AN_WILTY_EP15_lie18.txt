The subject’s raised eyebrows and exaggerated eye opening could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, these expressions might suggest an attempt to emphasize sincerity or surprise, possibly to convince the interlocutor of their truthfulness. Conversely, such heightened facial expressions could also be a deliberate effort to overcompensate and distract from underlying deceit. The upward movement of the chin may similarly be seen as a display of confidence and openness, signaling honesty. However, it might also be perceived as a subtle signaling of defensiveness or an effort to mask discomfort, which can accompany deceptive behavior. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor typically indicates engagement and transparency, yet it could alternatively reflect a conscious strategy to establish trust and govern the interaction to avoid suspicion. Nodding while communicating often serves as a sign of agreement and attentiveness, supporting credibility, but if excessive or incongruent with the verbal message, it might be rehearsed or manipulative. The crossing of fingers, a gesture traditionally linked with telling a lie or invoking luck, could be an unconscious admission of deceit or, alternatively, a benign habit or even a cultural tic without deceptive intent. Ultimately, these behaviors should be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction and additional cues to form a balanced assessment.

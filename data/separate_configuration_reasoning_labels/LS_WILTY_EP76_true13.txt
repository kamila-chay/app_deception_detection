The subject’s laughter can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing the potential for deception. On one hand, laughter might serve as a genuine expression of amusement or a natural social response aimed at easing tension and fostering rapport with the interlocutor, suggesting sincerity in their communication. Conversely, laughter could also be employed as a strategic tool to deflect suspicion, mask discomfort, or disrupt the flow of questioning, which might indicate an underlying attempt to conceal the truth. Similarly, the subject’s steady gaze towards their interlocutor contributes to this ambiguous picture. Maintaining eye contact is often regarded as a sign of honesty and engagement, reflecting openness and confidence in what is being communicated. However, it is also recognized that purposeful eye contact can be consciously controlled to project credibility, potentially serving as a tactic to persuade or manipulate the listener. Without additional contextual cues or information about the subject’s baseline behavior and the dynamics of the interaction, it remains challenging to definitively interpret these behaviors as indicators of either truthfulness or deception.

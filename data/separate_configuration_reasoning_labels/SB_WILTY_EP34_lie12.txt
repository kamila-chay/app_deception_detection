The individual’s frowning eyebrows might be interpreted as a sign of concentration or discomfort, which can be associated with the cognitive effort involved in fabricating a story. Alternatively, this expression could simply reflect genuine concern or confusion about the topic being discussed, without any deceptive intent. Their closed mouth and downward lip corners may suggest restraint, possibly indicating hesitation or an attempt to withhold information, traits often linked to deceit. Conversely, these features might also arise from feeling thoughtful or emotionally subdued in a serious conversation. The protrusion of the lips could be viewed as a subtle display of tension or frustration, hinting at internal conflict that sometimes accompanies dishonesty. On the other hand, it might be a habitual or natural facial posture unrelated to deception. The subject’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor could imply confidence and sincerity, a willingness to engage openly. Yet, alternating this with sideways glances might raise suspicion, as shifting gaze can be a common cue linked with evasiveness or discomfort when fabricating responses. Nonetheless, such gaze aversions can also indicate the person is processing information, recalling memories, or managing social anxiety. Ultimately, these behaviors possess ambiguous interpretations, and without further context, it remains challenging to definitively classify the subject as truthful or deceptive.

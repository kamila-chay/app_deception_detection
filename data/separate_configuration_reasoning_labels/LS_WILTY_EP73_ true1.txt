The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen in two contrasting lights. Maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as they appear engaged and transparent in the conversation. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate attempt to overcompensate for deception, with prolonged eye contact used to appear credible or to mask unease. When their gaze shifts upward, this behavior might indicate genuine cognitive effort as they try to recall details or construct a truthful response. On the other hand, this very upward gaze could be interpreted as a sign of fabricating a story or mentally distancing themselves from the interaction to avoid confronting uncomfortable truths.

Their head tilting could further complicate the interpretation. A tilted head often connotes openness and curiosity, which might support the notion that the individual is being sincere and receptive to the dialogue. Yet, head tilting can also be a subconscious strategy to deflect and lower a person’s assertiveness, potentially creating a more favorable impression while hiding deceitful intentions. Similarly, the side-turn of the head introduces ambiguity; it might reflect a thoughtful and reflective stance, indicating the person is carefully considering their words out of honesty. Alternatively, this movement could suggest evasiveness and a subtle withdrawal from full engagement, hinting at discomfort linked to concealing information.

Each of these behaviors, while informative, cannot independently confirm truthfulness or deception without additional contextual cues. They may be baseline expressions of the subject’s communication style or reactions influenced by the emotional and situational context. Thus, a holistic understanding of the interaction and accompanying verbal and nonverbal signals is essential for a more reliable assessment.

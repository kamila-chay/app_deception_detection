The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor could be interpreted in contrasting ways. On one hand, maintaining direct eye contact might suggest honesty and openness, as individuals who are truthful often engage attentively with their conversation partner to convey credibility. Conversely, it could also be a conscious effort to appear sincere, as some deceivers deliberately sustain strong eye contact to avoid suspicion. Similarly, the subtle head tilting observed might be perceived as a sign of engagement and genuine interest, reflecting a willingness to listen and connect during communication. However, this same gesture might also be employed strategically to soften their demeanor, masking underlying discomfort or uncertainty associated with deception. The palms-up gesture further adds to this ambiguity; it is commonly associated with openness and honesty, symbolizing that the person has nothing to hide. Yet, this behavior could also be a rehearsed or automatic cue meant to elicit trust, potentially serving as a nonverbal tactic to persuade or deflect scrutiny. Ultimately, without additional context, these behaviors remain open to interpretation, and they underscore the complexity of assessing truthfulness purely through nonverbal signals.

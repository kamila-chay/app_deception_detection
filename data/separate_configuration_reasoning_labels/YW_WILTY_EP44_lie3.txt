The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in more than one way. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often signifies confidence and sincerity, suggesting that the person is being truthful and open in the conversation. Conversely, sustained gaze can sometimes be a deliberate tactic to convey credibility and mask deceit, as some individuals overcompensate by trying to appear transparent. Their nodding may similarly carry dual meanings; it could indicate genuine agreement and active listening, reflecting engagement and honesty. Yet, it could also be a strategy to encourage the speaker while subtly manipulating the interaction or feigning understanding to avoid suspicion. The gesture of showing palms up is often associated with openness and vulnerability, which might support the impression of honesty and a willingness to be forthcoming. However, this same gesture can also be consciously employed to appear non-threatening and cooperative when attempting to mask deception. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered alongside broader contextual cues and baseline patterns to more accurately discern whether the individual is being truthful or deceptive.

The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can often be interpreted in multiple ways. Raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or uncertainty, which could be a subtle sign of discomfort associated with deception. Conversely, this same expression can reflect genuine engagement or curiosity, indicating openness and truthfulness, especially if it aligns with the conversational context. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor is another behavior open to dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact might imply confidence and sincerity, signaling that the person is communicating honestly. However, in some cases, sustained gaze might be a deliberate attempt to control the interaction or mask deceit, as some individuals overcompensate by making strong eye contact when fabricating information. Additionally, the subject’s palms are shown upward, a gesture commonly associated with openness and honesty, potentially reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. Yet, this posture can also be employed strategically to appear non-threatening or to persuade, which might raise questions about the authenticity of their statements. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered within the broader context of the interaction, as each can support contrasting conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness or potential deceptiveness.

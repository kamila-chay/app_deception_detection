The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the potential for deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest honesty and engagement, as people often look directly at others when they feel confident and truthful. It can be a sign of openness and a desire to establish trust. Conversely, sustained or intense eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and authoritative, potentially masking deceptive intentions. Some individuals may overcompensate by holding the gaze too rigidly in an effort to convince their audience.

Similarly, the subject’s open arms posture carries dual interpretations. Open arms can indicate a relaxed and welcoming attitude, signaling that the person has nothing to hide and is comfortable with the conversation. This openness often correlates with transparency and sincerity. On the other hand, such a posture might be consciously adopted to project warmth and honesty, serving as a façade to distract from internal discomfort or deceit. In some contexts, open arms could simply reflect a habitual or culturally influenced stance unrelated to truthfulness.

Ultimately, these behaviors alone—gaze towards the interlocutor and arms open—provide ambiguous signals that can support arguments both for and against deception. The broader situational context, baseline behavior, and accompanying verbal and nonverbal cues are essential to forming a more accurate assessment of the individual’s truthfulness.

The individual’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest concentration or discomfort, potentially signaling internal conflict associated with deception. Conversely, it could simply reflect genuine confusion or concern about the topic being discussed, indicating truthfulness. Their frequent blinking may point to heightened cognitive load or stress, common in situations where someone is fabricating information. However, frequent blinking can equally be a response to environmental factors such as bright lighting or dryness, making it an unreliable sole indicator of deceit. The upward movement of the chin might be read as a subtle display of defensiveness or an attempt to assert dominance, which some theories link to deceptive behavior. Alternatively, it might just be a natural posture or an unconscious gesture expressing confidence or attentiveness. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor typically suggests engagement and openness, often associated with honesty. Yet, steady eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy used by deceivers to appear credible and avoid suspicion. The subject’s nodding might be seen as a mechanism to appear agreeable and supportive, possibly to reinforce a fabricated story. On the other hand, nodding can simply demonstrate active listening and genuine understanding. Finally, having arms open generally conveys openness and receptivity, which may be a conscious effort to seem trustworthy. Nonetheless, open arms are also a relaxed and natural posture for many individuals, not necessarily linked to deception. Taken together, these behaviors require contextual interpretation, as each could be symptomatic of either truthfulness or deception depending on the broader circumstances and individual differences.

The person’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, suggesting they are genuinely engaged and truthful in the conversation. On the other hand, this same gesture could be a deliberate attempt to appear more convincing or to mask underlying discomfort, potentially hinting at deception. Similarly, their gaze directed toward the interlocutor is a behavior that can be viewed from two perspectives. Maintaining eye contact might indicate openness and honesty, reflecting confidence in their statements. Conversely, sustained gaze could also be a conscious effort to control the interaction and avoid suspicion, a tactic sometimes employed by individuals trying to fabricate or distort information. Ultimately, these behaviors should be interpreted in the context of the overall interaction and additional cues, as both raised eyebrows and directed gaze carry ambiguous meanings that can support arguments for both truthfulness and deceit.

The subject exhibits a range of facial and bodily movements that could be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. Their raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, which could suggest honesty as they genuinely react to the conversation. However, raised eyebrows can also be a deliberate attempt to feign innocence or disbelief, potentially masking deceptive intent. Similarly, the movements of the chin—both upwards and downwards—can convey different emotional states. A chin lifted upwards may be interpreted as a display of confidence and truthfulness, yet it might also be an unconscious defensive gesture aimed at creating distance or asserting dominance when feeling uneasy about lying. Conversely, lowering the chin can reflect submission or contemplation, which might indicate sincerity, but it could just as easily be a sign of discomfort or concealment associated with deceit.

Regarding gaze behavior, maintaining direct eye contact with the interlocutor is often seen as a hallmark of honesty and engagement. Nevertheless, sustained gaze can also be employed strategically to intimidate or overcompensate, potentially serving as a smokescreen for untruthfulness. On the other hand, looking upwards might suggest someone is accessing internal memories, which might support truthfulness, but it can also be a classic indicator of fabrication, as the person constructs a story rather than recalling actual experiences.

The positioning of the arms further complicates the interpretation. Open arms generally symbolize openness and receptiveness, reinforcing a perception of honesty. Yet, open arms could simply be a habitual or cultural posture unrelated to sincerity. Folded arms, by contrast, often signal defensiveness or self-protection, which might raise suspicions about the speaker’s truthfulness. However, folded arms can equally be a comfortable resting position, reflecting nothing more than personal preference or even attentiveness.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors could point toward either truthful or deceptive intentions, depending heavily on the broader context and baseline behaviors of the individual. Without additional information, it would be premature to draw firm conclusions, underscoring the need for a holistic approach when evaluating such cues.

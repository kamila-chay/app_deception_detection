The person’s sideways gaze could suggest they are avoiding direct eye contact, which is sometimes interpreted as a sign of discomfort or evasiveness potentially linked to deception. This behavior might indicate that they are concealing information or feeling uneasy about the topic at hand. Conversely, looking sideways can also be a natural and innocent reaction, such as recalling memories, processing information, or simply shifting their visual attention in a non-threatening manner. It might arise from habitual eye movement or cultural factors rather than any intent to deceive. Without considering the broader context—such as their baseline behavior, the conversational environment, or accompanying verbal cues—it is difficult to definitively interpret the significance of the sideways gaze. Thus, while this behavior can be consistent with both truthfulness and deception, additional information would be necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion.

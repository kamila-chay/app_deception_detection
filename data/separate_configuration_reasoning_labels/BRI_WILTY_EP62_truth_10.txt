The presence of a smile during the interaction can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, a genuine smile may suggest that the person feels comfortable and confident in what they are saying, which could imply honesty. It might also serve as a social signal of openness and a desire to connect, reinforcing the perception of sincerity. Conversely, smiles can also be deliberately employed as a mask to conceal discomfort or deceit. In this sense, the smile could be a strategic attempt to deflect suspicion or to manipulate the interlocutor’s impression, especially if it appears forced or inconsistent with the emotional context. Without additional cues or contextual information, it is difficult to discern whether the smile reflects genuine emotion or is a calculated behavior aimed at deception. Thus, while the smile could indicate truthfulness, it equally holds the potential to be a subtle sign of concealment.

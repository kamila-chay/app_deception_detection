The subject’s lips are retracted, which could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, this expression might suggest tension or discomfort, potentially stemming from the cognitive effort involved in fabricating information. On the other hand, lips retracted could also simply indicate concentration or an attempt to articulate thoughts clearly, unrelated to deception. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, a behavior that might imply confidence and openness, suggesting truthfulness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, sustained eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate tactic used to persuade or manipulate, possibly masking deceit. At times, the subject shifts their gaze downward. This downward glance might be a sign of evasiveness or guilt, as individuals who deceive often avoid direct eye contact. Alternatively, looking down can also occur as part of natural thought processing or modesty, not necessarily linked to dishonesty. Finally, the subject’s head is held up, which could denote assurance and credibility in their statements. Yet, it might also be a contrived posture aimed at projecting confidence to cover underlying uncertainty. Each behavioral cue taken in isolation can point towards either truthfulness or deception, and only by considering these actions within the fuller context of the interaction can more accurate conclusions be drawn.

The subject’s downward turn of the lip corners may be indicative of discomfort or negative emotions, which could suggest stress related to concealing information or fabricating a response. Conversely, this expression might simply reflect genuine sadness or concern unrelated to deception, highlighting the importance of contextualizing this behavior within the broader emotional state. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor typically signals engagement and confidence, potentially supporting an interpretation of truthfulness. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere and mask dishonest intentions, underscoring the complexity of interpreting gaze behaviors. The presence of occasional sideways glances introduces further ambiguity; these could signify evasiveness or anxiety about being untruthful, yet they might equally represent moments of thoughtful reflection or difficulty recalling details accurately. Additionally, the noticeable side-turn of the head might be read as a subtle attempt to create psychological distance, which some associate with deception. On the other hand, this gesture could simply indicate curiosity, uncertainty, or a natural conversational posture without any deceptive undertones. Overall, each observed behavior carries dual interpretations that must be weighed carefully in conjunction with additional contextual information to reach a more reliable conclusion regarding the subject’s truthfulness.

The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways: on one hand, this expression might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, serving as a nonverbal cue intended to convey sincerity. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also function as a deliberate exaggeration of innocence or incredulity, potentially masking deceit by drawing attention away from a falsehood. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor further complicates interpretation; steady eye contact can be a sign of confidence and truthfulness, suggesting engagement and transparency. However, in some cases, this same behavior may be a conscious effort to appear credible, as maintaining eye contact is often taught as a strategy to avoid suspicion when fabricating information.

The movement of their head backward introduces another layer of ambiguity. Leaning away might reflect discomfort or a subconscious desire to create distance from the topic at hand, possibly hinting at evasiveness or concealment. Alternatively, it might simply indicate thoughtful consideration or a momentary reaction to new information, without any deceptive intent. Their palms held up and arms open are generally associated with openness and receptiveness, gestures commonly interpreted as signals of honesty and vulnerability. Yet, these gestures can also be consciously employed to project trustworthiness and disarm skepticism, functioning as part of a controlled effort to persuade or manipulate.

In sum, each of these behaviors—raised eyebrows, sustained gaze, head movement, and open palm and arm gestures—carries dual potential meanings that depend heavily on the larger context and the individual’s baseline behavior. Without further context or corroborating evidence, it remains equally plausible that these cues reflect genuine truthfulness or are strategic elements of deception.

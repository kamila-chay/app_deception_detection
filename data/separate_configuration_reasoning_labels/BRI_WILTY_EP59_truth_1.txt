The subject’s frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which could be interpreted as a sign of internal conflict often associated with deception. Conversely, such a furrowed brow can equally indicate genuine frustration or confusion unrelated to dishonesty. Raising eyebrows, commonly viewed as a sign of surprise or disbelief, could imply an attempt to feign innocence or amplify emotions to convince the listener. However, this gesture might simply reflect natural emotional reactions or an effort to emphasize sincerity. The retraction of the lips could be perceived as a subtle expression of tension or suppressed emotions, potentially signaling deceit. Yet, it might also represent a habitual facial expression or a response to stress that has no bearing on truthfulness. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor can be seen as an effort to establish trust and credibility, reinforcing the perception of honesty. On the other hand, sustained eye contact may be consciously maintained to distract from deceptive intent. A downward gaze might suggest discomfort, evasiveness, or concealing information, hinting at possible untruthfulness. Alternatively, looking down might simply reflect cultural communication norms, shyness, or the process of recalling memories. The subject’s head tilt could indicate engagement and openness, signaling truthful communication. However, it could also be a tactic to soften their demeanor and manipulate the listener’s perception in a deceptive context. Without a comprehensive understanding of the broader situation and baseline behavior, each of these cues remains equivocal, necessitating cautious interpretation before drawing conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

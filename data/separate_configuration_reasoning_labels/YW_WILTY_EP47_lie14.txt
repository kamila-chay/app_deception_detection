The person’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or confusion, which could indicate that the individual is reacting genuinely to unexpected information or asking for clarification, suggesting honesty. Conversely, this same gesture could also be a deliberate attempt to feign surprise or innocence, potentially masking deceptive intentions. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor similarly presents a dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact might reflect confidence and transparency, often associated with truthfulness, as the person appears engaged and open. However, sustained gaze can also be a conscious strategy to persuade or manipulate, as some individuals deliberately hold eye contact to appear more credible when fabricating information. Additionally, the visible gesture of palms up can be seen as a sign of openness and sincerity, symbolizing that the person has nothing to hide. Yet, this same gesture can be employed strategically to invoke trust or appeal to the listener’s empathy, which could be a tactic used when attempting to deceive. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered within the broader context, as each action carries meanings that can support both truthful and deceptive interpretations. A more comprehensive assessment including verbal cues, baseline behaviors, and situational factors would be necessary to draw a more definitive conclusion.

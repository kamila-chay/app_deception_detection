The subject’s scowl may suggest frustration or discomfort, which in some contexts could be interpreted as a sign of deception, possibly reflecting the mental strain of fabricating information. Conversely, this expression might simply indicate genuine displeasure or concentration, unrelated to any deceitful intent. Similarly, the downward pull of the lip corners can be seen as a marker of distress or sadness, emotions that might emerge from the stress of lying. Yet, it could equally represent a natural emotional response to the conversation’s topic or environment, without any connection to truthfulness. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor could imply confidence, which might support the notion of honesty and straightforwardness. On the other hand, sustained eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy employed to convince or manipulate, aiming to mask deception. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors depends heavily on the broader context, including baseline behavior, situational factors, and corroborating cues, making it essential to consider multiple dimensions before drawing conclusions about their veracity.

The individual maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering potential deception. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest openness and honesty, signaling a willingness to engage transparently in the conversation. Conversely, deliberate gaze could also be a strategic effort to appear sincere and thereby mask deceptive intentions. Similarly, the person’s consistent nodding could be viewed as an indicator of agreement and genuine engagement, reinforcing the idea that they are truthful and involved in the exchange. However, nodding might also function as a social cue intended to placate the listener or affirm statements that are not necessarily truthful, potentially serving as a subtle tool to manipulate perception. Ultimately, these behaviors must be situated within a broader context to disentangle genuine communication from possible deception, as each gesture can support contrasting interpretations depending on the circumstances and additional cues.

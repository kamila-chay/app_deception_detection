The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. On one hand, this expression might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness in communication, potentially reinforcing their truthfulness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes be employed strategically to feign surprise or to distract the interlocutor, which might indicate a calculated effort to mislead. Their tendency to gaze sideways similarly admits dual interpretations. A sideways glance could suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation, possibly signaling evasiveness consistent with deception. However, such gaze aversion may also simply reflect the cognitive process of recalling information or natural conversational dynamics without any deceptive intent. The backward movement of the head is another ambiguous cue. It may indicate a subconscious attempt to create physical distance from an uncomfortable topic, hinting at dishonesty. Alternatively, this gesture can be a genuine expression of thoughtfulness or skepticism as they critically evaluate questions or statements, not necessarily tied to deception. Finally, the subject’s folded arms might be viewed as a defensive posture that could signify resistance to scrutiny or an effort to shield oneself from revealing too much. Yet, this same body language can merely reflect comfort or habit, especially in situations where a person feels cold or is simply adopting a resting position. In sum, each of these behaviors—raising eyebrows, sideways gaze, head movement, and folded arms—presents plausible arguments for both truthful and deceptive motivations. Without additional contextual information, it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions solely based on these observable cues.

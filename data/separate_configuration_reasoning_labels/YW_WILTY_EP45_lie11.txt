The subject’s lip corners are turned up, which could be interpreted as a sign of genuine friendliness or comfort in the interaction, suggesting they are being truthful and at ease. Conversely, this subtle smile might also be a social mask, consciously or unconsciously employed to deflect scrutiny or mask discomfort, thus potentially indicating deception. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor can be seen as a sign of engagement and honesty, reflecting openness and confidence in the communication. Yet, maintaining strong eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy to convince or manipulate, as deceivers sometimes overcompensate to appear credible. Meanwhile, the gaze shifting upward introduces another layer of complexity; this eye movement might point to reflective thinking or accessing memory, which supports the notion that the person is recalling truthful information. On the flip side, an upward gaze is sometimes associated with the construction of fabricated information or mental imagery, which could imply that they are inventing rather than recalling details. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors demands consideration of the broader context, as each characteristic can hold contrasting meanings depending on situational nuances.

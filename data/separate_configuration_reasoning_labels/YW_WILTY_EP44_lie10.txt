The subject’s lip corners turning up could be interpreted as a genuine smile, suggesting comfort and sincerity in the interaction. However, this same expression might be a deliberate attempt to appear friendly and put the interlocutor at ease, potentially masking deceptive intentions. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor generally indicates engagement and openness, which often aligns with truthful communication. Conversely, maintaining strong eye contact can sometimes be a conscious strategy to overcompensate for dishonesty, designed to project confidence and credibility.

The palms-up gesture is traditionally seen as a sign of openness and honesty, reinforcing the impression that the person is being forthright. Yet, this gesture can also be employed unconsciously or intentionally to feign transparency or elicit trust. Meanwhile, the shrug could signify uncertainty or a genuine lack of information, which might support the idea that the person is being truthful about not knowing something. On the other hand, a shrug might be used as a nonverbal tactic to deflect responsibility or avoid providing a direct answer, which could be indicative of evasiveness.

Each of these behaviors carries potential meanings that depend heavily on the broader context of the interaction, including baseline behavior, the nature of the conversation, and cultural factors. Without additional contextual information, it remains equally plausible that these signals reflect honesty or, alternatively, are part of a complex web of cues masking deception.

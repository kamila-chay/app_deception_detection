The individual’s smile can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, a genuine smile may reflect sincere positive emotions and comfort in the interaction, suggesting truthfulness. On the other hand, a smile—especially if it seems forced or overly broad—could be employed strategically to mask discomfort or to manipulate the perception of honesty. Similarly, their exaggerated eye opening might be viewed as an attempt to convey attentiveness and openness, signaling engagement and transparency. Conversely, such amplified expressions may be consciously or unconsciously used to overcompensate for a lack of credibility, serving as a cue for deception by drawing undue attention to their eyes. The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor also offers dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact can be a sign of confidence and straightforwardness, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. However, deliberate or sustained gaze can sometimes indicate an effort to convince or control the listener, potentially reflecting underlying anxiety about being disbelieved. These behaviors, therefore, necessitate careful consideration of the broader situational context and baseline patterns to more accurately assess their significance in relation to honesty or deception.

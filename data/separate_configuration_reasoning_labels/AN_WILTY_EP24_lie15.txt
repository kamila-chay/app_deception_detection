The subject’s smile can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, a smile might serve as a genuine expression of warmth and openness, signaling comfort and honesty in the interaction. On the other hand, it could be a carefully controlled social cue designed to mask discomfort or conceal information, potentially indicating an attempt to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception. Similarly, the subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can suggest engagement and sincerity, reflecting attentiveness and a willingness to connect sincerely in the conversation. Conversely, sustained eye contact could also be a deliberate effort to appear trustworthy and confident, possibly to deflect suspicion or to reinforce a fabricated narrative. The head tilting behavior adds another layer of complexity; it might be a natural response indicating curiosity, empathy, or active listening, thereby reinforcing the subject’s openness. Alternatively, it could be a subconscious attempt to soften the interaction or signal submissiveness, which might be employed strategically to elicit sympathy or reduce scrutiny. Each behavior, therefore, carries ambiguous signals that must be interpreted within a broader context, as they can equally point to authenticity or deception depending on the situation and accompanying cues.

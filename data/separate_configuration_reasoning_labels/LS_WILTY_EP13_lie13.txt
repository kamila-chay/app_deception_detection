The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways; on one hand, this expression might signal surprise or heightened alertness often associated with attempting to deceive or fabricate information. Conversely, it could simply indicate genuine curiosity or emphasis on the subject matter being discussed, reflecting sincerity rather than falsehood. Their frequent blinking may suggest nervousness or stress typically linked to dishonesty, as people who are deceptive sometimes exhibit physiological signs of discomfort. However, excessive blinking can also be a natural response to environmental factors such as lighting or dryness of the eyes, or simply a habit unrelated to the truthfulness of their statements.

The sideways gaze might be seen as an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which some interpret as a subconscious effort to divert attention during deception. Yet, this gaze could equally reflect the person’s process of thinking or recalling information, as looking away can aid concentration and memory retrieval. Similarly, the movement of the head backward might be perceived as a defensive or distancing gesture, potentially indicative of discomfort with the topic and thus, suspicion. On the other hand, this motion could just as well signify surprise, emphasizing a point, or an attempt to gain a better perspective of the environment, without necessarily implying deceit.

Finally, the head side-turn can be viewed through a dual lens as well; it may be a nonverbal cue pointing to skepticism or avoidance consistent with concealing the truth. Alternatively, it might simply be a natural, unconscious movement reflective of attentiveness or engagement in a dynamic conversation. Without additional context, such as the individual's baseline behavior and the specifics of the interaction, it remains challenging to definitively categorize these behaviors as markers of deception or truthfulness.

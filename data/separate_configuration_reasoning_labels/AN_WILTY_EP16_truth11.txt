The individual’s chin moving downwards can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might indicate a form of submission or discomfort that could arise if they are feeling deceptive or guilty. Lowering the chin can be a subtle attempt to withdraw or avoid full engagement with the interlocutor, potentially signaling unease associated with dishonesty. On the other hand, this gesture might simply reflect a natural or habitual posture, or even a thoughtful state, where the person is processing information internally without any deceptive intent.

Their gaze alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking down is also open to dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact is often seen as a sign of honesty and confidence, which would support the assumption that the person is being truthful. However, prolonged eye contact can sometimes be consciously maintained to appear convincing while hiding deceit. Conversely, the moments when they look down could suggest avoidance or discomfort associated with lying, as individuals may avert their gaze to escape scrutiny. Yet, it is equally plausible that looking down reflects concentration or an effort to recall details accurately, rather than an indication of deception.

The head tilting behavior similarly carries ambiguous significance. Tilting the head can convey empathy and engagement, signaling openness and sincere interest in the conversation, which leans toward truthful communication. At the same time, head tilts might be employed strategically to soften one’s demeanor and elicit trust, potentially masking deceptive intentions. Alternatively, tilting the head may simply be a physical response to processing complex information or a habitual gesture unrelated to honesty or deceit.

In sum, each of these visible behaviors—the downward movement of the chin, the shifting gaze, and the tilting of the head—can be reasonably interpreted both as signs of potential deception or as innocuous, truthful, or contextually appropriate reactions. Without additional information about the broader context, verbal content, and baseline behavior, it remains difficult to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the individual’s truthfulness.

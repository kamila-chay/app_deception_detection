The subject’s tendency to gaze down can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking downward might suggest evasion or discomfort, potentially indicating that the person is trying to distance themselves from the truth or hide something. This behavior could be a subconscious attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which is often associated with dishonesty. On the other hand, lowering one's gaze can simply reflect introspection or the cognitive process of retrieving information from memory, especially if the topic at hand is complex or emotionally charged. It may also be a sign of respect, humility, or cultural norm rather than an attempt to deceive. Without additional contextual cues—such as body language, verbal inconsistencies, or the situational background—it is challenging to definitively link this behavior to truthfulness or deception. Therefore, while the downward gaze could hint at concealment, it equally might underscore genuine thoughtfulness or emotional sensitivity.

The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as they are openly engaging with the listener without attempting to avoid scrutiny. It could indicate a genuine attempt to connect and communicate sincerely. Conversely, prolonged or intense eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit by appearing more credible or to monitor the listener’s reactions closely, making it harder for the listener to detect inconsistencies. Hence, their gaze alone cannot conclusively reveal truthfulness or deception.

Similarly, the head tilting behavior presents a nuanced picture. Head tilting may convey interest, openness, and active listening, traits commonly associated with truthful exchanges. It can signal empathy or a thoughtful consideration of the interlocutor’s words. On the flip side, this gesture might also be employed to feign attentiveness or to manipulate the listener’s perception by appearing more engaged than one truly is. In some cases, it might even serve as a subtle form of nonverbal pacing during fabricated storytelling, helping the individual organize their thoughts under pressure.

Ultimately, these behaviors—both the gaze directed at the interlocutor and the head tilt—carry ambiguous meanings that depend heavily on the broader conversational and situational context. Without additional cues or corroborating information, it remains equally plausible that the subject is either communicating honestly or strategically managing their nonverbal signals to support deception.

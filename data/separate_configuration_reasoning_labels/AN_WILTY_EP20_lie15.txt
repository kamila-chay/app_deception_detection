The subject’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest engagement and confidence, which can be interpreted as signs of honesty and openness. Such eye contact often conveys a willingness to communicate transparently and can be reassuring in assessing truthfulness. Conversely, maintaining prolonged eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, as individuals may overcompensate by appearing overly attentive in order to convince the listener of their sincerity.

Similarly, the observed head side-turn may carry dual interpretations. On one hand, turning the head slightly away could indicate discomfort or evasiveness, potentially signaling inner conflict or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation when fabricating information. It may further reflect hesitation or uncertainty about the narrative being presented. On the other hand, this gesture might simply be a natural, habitual movement that occurs during conversation, or a way for the person to process information and gather their thoughts without implying deception.

Ultimately, these behaviors should be understood within the broader context of the interaction and accompanied by additional cues. Is the subject’s gaze steady or fleeting? Is the head turn accompanied by other signs of nervousness or is it part of an otherwise relaxed demeanor? Without this wider perspective, it remains equally plausible that these behaviors either support honesty or mask deception.

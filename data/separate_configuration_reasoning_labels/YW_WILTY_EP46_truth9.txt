The person’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways; they might indicate surprise or emphasis, which can be consistent with truthfulness when conveying genuine reactions. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a deliberate attempt to appear more sincere or to distract from deceptive intent. The subtle lifting of the lip corners suggests a mild smile, which could signal comfort and openness, typically associated with honesty. However, this expression might also be a controlled social smile meant to mask discomfort or to persuade the interlocutor, potentially hinting at deception.

The upward movement of the chin and head can convey confidence and assertiveness, qualities often linked to truthful communication. Yet, such gestures might also be used to project dominance and conceal uncertainty, suggesting possible fabrication. Their gaze towards the interlocutor typically denotes engagement and transparency, reinforcing credibility. On the other hand, the shift of gaze upwards could reflect cognitive processing or fabricating details, which may raise questions about the authenticity of their statements.

Open palms and arms extended in an open posture are generally regarded as signs of honesty and openness, inviting trust. Still, these gestures can be consciously employed to appear more trustworthy and to disarm suspicion, thus complicating the interpretation. When evaluating these behaviors collectively, each can carry dual meanings depending on the broader context, the person’s baseline behavior, and cultural factors. Therefore, while some cues suggest sincerity, others might equally signify an effort to deceive, underscoring the importance of additional contextual information to reach a more definitive assessment.

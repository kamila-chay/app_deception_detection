The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest engagement and sincerity, as maintaining eye contact is often associated with honesty and openness. However, this same behavior could also be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to appear truthful, with the individual consciously holding eye contact to avoid suspicion. Similarly, the forward movement of their head could indicate active interest and confidence in their statements, signaling a genuine connection with the conversation. On the other hand, this gesture might be a strategic move to assert dominance or persuade the listener, which can sometimes be a tactic employed by someone fabricating information. Ultimately, these behaviors, while potentially insightful, are ambiguous without broader contextual cues, making it essential to consider additional information before drawing conclusions about their truthfulness or deception.

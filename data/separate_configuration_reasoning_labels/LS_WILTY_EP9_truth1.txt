The subject’s lips corners are turned down, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. This expression might suggest sadness or discomfort often associated with concealing information or feeling guilty, potentially hinting at deceptive behavior. Conversely, it might simply reflect genuine emotional distress or concentration unrelated to dishonesty. Their lips are also protruded and retracted at different moments, behaviors that could be viewed as signs of tension or hesitation, possibly indicative of someone fabricating parts of their narrative. On the other hand, these lip movements might just be natural, unconscious reactions to speaking or thinking, without any deceptive intent.

Their gaze shifts downward and sideways, which might traditionally be seen as avoidance or an attempt to escape direct eye contact due to feelings of guilt or anxiety stemming from deception. However, such gaze patterns can equally be attributed to internal cognitive processing or recall, with the individual searching their memory or organizing thoughts rather than deliberately misleading. Despite these potentially avoidant gaze behaviors, their arms remain open, a gesture that is often associated with openness and a willingness to communicate honestly. This openness could signify a genuine desire to be transparent, yet it might also be a deliberate posture to project sincerity and mask deceit.

Ultimately, each of these behavioral cues requires careful consideration within the broader context of the interaction. While some signs align with common indicators of deception, they might just as plausibly reflect natural emotional or cognitive states. Identifying truthfulness or deception based solely on these observable behaviors remains challenging and necessitates additional contextual information to form a more confident assessment.

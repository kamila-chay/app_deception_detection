The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can signify surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating honesty if they are genuinely reacting to information. However, raised eyebrows might also be used strategically to feign innocence or to distract the listener, which could suggest deception. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted as a sign of engagement and openness, implying truthfulness and willingness to communicate transparently. Conversely, sustained eye contact might also be a deliberate attempt to convince or manipulate, as some deceivers use steady gazes to appear credible. The occasional sideways glances introduce further ambiguity; such behavior could reflect the natural cognitive process of retrieving memories or organizing thoughts, which would support the idea that they are being truthful. Alternatively, these glances might be indicative of discomfort or evasiveness, common in deceptive behavior as the person tries to avoid direct scrutiny. Ultimately, without additional contextual information, these behaviors alone provide ambiguous signals that can be reasonably interpreted to support both truthfulness and deception.

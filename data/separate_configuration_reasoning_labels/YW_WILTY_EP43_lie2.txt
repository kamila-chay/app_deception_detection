The subject's raising of their eyebrows may be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, this gesture could signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity and openness, which would support the notion of truthfulness. Conversely, exaggerated eyebrow movements might be a deliberate effort to convey an impression of honesty or to distract the observer from inconsistencies, suggesting possible deceit. The noticeably exaggerated opening of the mouth similarly presents dual interpretations; it might reflect genuine astonishment or an earnest reaction, yet it could also be an overacted display intended to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception.

Their gaze behavior provides further complexity. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor often aligns with straightforwardness and engagement. Alternatively, such sustained gaze can sometimes be consciously maintained to mask deceptive intentions, as liars may attempt to overcompensate through eye contact. The intermittent upward and sideways glances further complicate interpretation. Looking upward might indicate cognitive processing or effort to retrieve truthful memories, but it might also reflect the construction of fabricated information. Sideways glances could signify distraction or social discomfort associated with dishonesty, or they might simply be part of natural conversational dynamics and thought patterns.

Nodding appears as an affirming gesture; it can denote agreement and active listening, consistent with truth-telling. However, if excessive or misplaced, nodding might be employed to feign understanding or to encourage the interlocutor to accept fabricated statements. Lastly, the palms-up gesture is commonly associated with openness and honesty, as if inviting trust. Yet, this same gesture could be strategically used as a visual cue to persuade and convince, potentially masking deceptive motives.

Given these behaviors, it is imperative to consider the broader context, including baseline behavior and environmental factors, to more confidently discern the subject’s truthfulness or deception. Without such context, each behavior equally lends itself to interpretations supporting either honesty or falsification.

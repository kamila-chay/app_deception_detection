The subject’s gaze behavior presents a complex picture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest openness and honesty, as maintaining eye contact often conveys confidence and transparency. However, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear convincing and mask deceit, as some individuals use sustained eye contact to project sincerity even when fabricating information. When their gaze shifts upward, this could indicate mental visualization or the effort to retrieve a truthful memory, supporting the idea that they are being truthful. Conversely, this upward gaze might also reflect cognitive load associated with constructing a story, which can occur during deceptive responses.

Similarly, looking down can be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or guilt, potentially signaling an attempt to hide something or avoid confrontation. On the other hand, the downward gaze might simply be a natural response to processing complex information or a moment of reflection, not necessarily linked to dishonesty. The act of nodding adds another layer to consider: it may demonstrate engagement and agreement, reinforcing the perception of earnestness. Alternatively, nodding might be a calculated effort to encourage the interlocutor’s acceptance or to distract from inconsistencies. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the overall communicative context, as each could support either truthful or deceptive intent depending on accompanying verbal cues and situational factors.

The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this action might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, often used to reinforce a truthful expression. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a subtle cue of disbelief or skepticism, sometimes employed to mask uncertainty or fabricate a response. Their lip corners are turned down, which might indicate sadness or discomfort, possibly reflecting the emotional weight of telling the truth in a difficult situation. However, the same expression could also mask guilt or an attempt to appear remorseful, which might be strategically used to deceive. The person is maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior commonly associated with sincerity and engagement, suggesting that they are being truthful by maintaining open eye contact. Yet, in some cases, deliberate eye contact can be a conscious effort to appear convincing when fabricating a story. Notably, the gaze occasionally shifts upward, a movement that can suggest the subject is engaged in recall, which aligns with truthful recollection. Alternatively, this upward gaze might be indicative of constructing a narrative or searching for fabricated details, hinting at potential deception. Finally, the subject’s shrugging could be interpreted as a sign of uncertainty or acceptance of facts they genuinely do not control, consistent with honesty. On the other hand, a shrug might be used to deflect responsibility or express feigned ignorance, serving as a subtle tactic to avoid directly addressing a deceptive statement. Ultimately, these behaviors are open to multiple interpretations, and additional contextual information is essential to draw a well-founded conclusion about the subject’s truthfulness or deception.

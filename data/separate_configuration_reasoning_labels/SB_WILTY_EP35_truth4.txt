The individual’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might suggest a genuine positive emotion, indicating comfort and truthfulness in the interaction. Conversely, such expressions can sometimes be consciously controlled or forced to mask discomfort or deceit, serving as a social veneer rather than a reflection of sincerity. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor could be interpreted as engagement and honesty, signaling openness and attentiveness. However, this same direct gaze might also be deliberately maintained to avoid suspicion, while the occasional sideways glances could indicate evasiveness or an attempt to fabricate details. Alternatively, these glances may simply reflect normal cognitive processing or attempts to recall information. The turning of the head to the side might communicate submissiveness or uncertainty, possibly linked to deception or discomfort with the topic. Yet, it could equally be a natural posture change or an expression of thoughtfulness. The frequent touching of the head and body, as well as covering the face or mouth with the hands, often suggests anxiety or self-soothing behaviors that can accompany deceptive behavior. On the other hand, these gestures might be habitual, driven by nervousness unrelated to dishonesty, or simply a means to concentrate. Without additional context—such as baseline behavior, environmental factors, and verbal content—it remains challenging to definitively interpret these behaviors as either truthful or deceptive.

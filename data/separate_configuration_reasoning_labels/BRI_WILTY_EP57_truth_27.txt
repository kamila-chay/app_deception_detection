The subject’s downward movement of the chin could be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, lowering the chin might signal submission or discomfort, potentially reflecting an internal struggle with dishonesty or guilt. Conversely, it may simply represent a natural reaction to thinking deeply or reflecting on the conversation, without any deceptive intent. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor is another behavior that invites dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact is often considered a sign of honesty and engagement, suggesting openness and confidence in the narrative being shared. However, some individuals deliberately maintain eye contact to appear trustworthy, masking their true intentions, which complicates any straightforward conclusions. The occasional sideways glance further adds to this complexity. Such glances could indicate evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation, thus hinting at possible deception. On the other hand, these glances might be associated with cognitive processing, as the person tries to access memories or formulate accurate responses. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the broader context of the interaction and additional cues to form a more definitive judgment about the person’s truthfulness.

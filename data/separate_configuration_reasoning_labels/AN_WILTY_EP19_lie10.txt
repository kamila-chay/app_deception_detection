The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest a willingness to engage openly, which is often interpreted as a sign of honesty and confidence. However, in some cases, sustained eye contact can be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, aiming to convince the listener by appearing overly attentive. Their nodding during the conversation could be seen as a positive indicator of receptiveness and agreement, reflecting genuine understanding or affirmation. Conversely, excessive or exaggerated nodding might be employed to feign agreement and encourage the interlocutor’s assumptions, potentially signaling an attempt to manipulate the perception of truthfulness. The palms-up gesture typically conveys openness and sincerity, as if the person is metaphorically showing they have nothing to hide. Yet, this same gesture can be consciously or subconsciously used as a persuasive tool, designed to elicit trust and empathy, regardless of the actual intent behind the communication. Ultimately, without considering the broader context and additional behavioral cues, these actions alone do not definitively confirm either honesty or deception.

The individual’s exaggerated eye closing could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might suggest an attempt to shield themselves from discomfort or a subconscious effort to momentarily disengage from the conversation, which can be a sign of internal conflict or deception. Conversely, it could simply be a natural facial expression or a reaction to bright lighting or fatigue, unrelated to any deceitful intent. The lips protruding may similarly indicate tension or stress commonly associated with dishonesty, as the person might be suppressing a truthful response or fabricating information. However, this gesture can also be a habitual or thinking posture without deeper significance.

Their gaze behavior adds another layer of complexity. Direct gaze with the interlocutor typically suggests engagement and sincerity, yet in some cases, it may be a conscious effort to appear truthful and mask deception. Meanwhile, glancing sideways can signal avoidance or uncertainty, potentially pointing to evasiveness; alternately, it can be a natural part of processing information, searching for memory cues, or a cultural norm unrelated to dishonesty.

Nodding while listening generally implies agreement or attentiveness, which might indicate honest participation in the conversation. However, exaggerated or insincere nodding can sometimes be a tactic to feign understanding or compliance, possibly deflecting scrutiny. The head side-turn could be read as a subtle avoidance or discomfort, hinting at reluctance to fully disclose information, yet it might also reflect a simple shift in attention or comfort.

The various hand movements—rubbing, scratching, or touching the head and body—could be indicative of nervousness or anxiety associated with concealing the truth, as self-soothing gestures often emerge under stress. On the other hand, these gestures might just represent habitual or situational responses to tension, external irritations, or social anxiety, with no direct relation to deception.

Ultimately, while these behaviors can be consistent with both truthful and deceptive presentations, definitive conclusions require careful consideration of the overall context, baseline behavior, and situational factors to accurately interpret their significance.

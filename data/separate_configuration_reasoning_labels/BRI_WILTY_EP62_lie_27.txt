The subject maintains steady eye contact throughout the interaction, which can often be interpreted as a sign of confidence and sincerity, suggesting they are being truthful. However, in some cases, deliberate eye contact may be used to mask deception or to compensate for feelings of guilt, making it a possible indicator of dishonesty depending on context. Their gestures are relatively controlled and measured, which might reveal a composed and honest demeanor. Conversely, such restraint could also signal an attempt to suppress nervous or deceptive behaviors, indicating discomfort with the narrative they are presenting. The person’s tone of voice remains steady and even, supporting the impression of openness and veracity. Yet, an even tone can sometimes be a conscious effort to appear credible and conceal underlying anxiety or fabrication. Additionally, subtle micro-expressions of unease occasionally flicker across their face, which might betray hidden emotions associated with lying, but could just as well be attributed to normal stress or fatigue unrelated to deceit. Given these behaviors, only with further contextual information can one make a more definitive judgment regarding the subject’s truthfulness.

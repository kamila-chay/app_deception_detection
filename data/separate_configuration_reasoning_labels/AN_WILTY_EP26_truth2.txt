The subject’s scowl might suggest frustration or discomfort, which could be interpreted as a sign of concealing information or stress related to dishonesty. Conversely, it could simply reflect concentration or genuine emotional response to the topic being discussed, with no link to deceit. Their raised eyebrows may indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, yet they could also be a subtle cue of skepticism or a deliberate effort to appear engaged and honest while concealing the truth. The direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen as a demonstration of confidence and openness, enhancing the perception of truthfulness. On the other hand, sustained eye contact might be a conscious strategy to convince the listener and mask deception. When the subject’s gaze shifts downward, this could signal discomfort or evasiveness characteristic of deceptive behavior. However, looking down might also simply reflect internal reflection, embarrassment, or an attempt to recall details accurately. Finally, the head side-turn may be interpreted as a non-verbal sign of distancing or avoidance, potentially signaling reluctance to be truthful. Alternatively, it could be an innocuous gesture linked to processing information or a natural conversational rhythm. Without further contextual information, these behaviors remain open to multiple interpretations, and caution should be exercised before drawing firm conclusions about the subject’s veracity.

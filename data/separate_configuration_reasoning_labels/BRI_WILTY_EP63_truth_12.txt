The subject’s gaze directed upward can be interpreted from multiple perspectives when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking up might suggest that the person is attempting to access visual memories, which could imply they are fabricating or reconstructing details rather than recalling genuine information. This upward gaze could be a subconscious cue indicative of someone searching for a plausible response, potentially hinting at deception. Conversely, the same behavior can be a natural part of thought processing or reflection, as individuals often look upward when genuinely trying to remember past events. In this light, the gaze up may simply reflect honest mental effort rather than avoidance or evasion. Without additional context, such as the subject’s baseline behavior or other nonverbal and verbal cues, it is difficult to definitively determine whether this upward gaze signals deceit or sincere recollection.

The subject displays a smile with lip corners turned upwards and lips retracted, which can often be interpreted as a sign of genuine friendliness and openness, suggesting they may be truthful. However, these same facial cues can also be deliberately employed to mask discomfort or to present a false sense of sincerity, thus potentially signaling deceit. The raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or engagement, pointing towards an honest reaction, yet in another context, they could be a subtle attempt to appear more convincing or to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception. Frequent blinking is a behavior that can reflect cognitive effort or nervousness often associated with fabricating information, but it can equally be a natural physiological response to stress or an attempt to maintain focus during a complex conversation. The steady gaze directed towards the interlocutor might demonstrate confidence and openness, reinforcing a truthful demeanor, or, contrarily, it could represent a calculated effort to maintain control over the interaction and conceal underlying dishonesty. Additionally, the head tilting combined with side-turning gestures may be read as signs of empathy and active listening, which build rapport and imply sincerity. Conversely, these actions might also be strategic non-verbal cues designed to distract or soften the impact of deceptive statements. Ultimately, without considering the broader context and the subject’s baseline behaviors, these indicators alone cannot definitively confirm truthfulness or deception.

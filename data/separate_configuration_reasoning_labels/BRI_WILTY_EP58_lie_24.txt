The subject raises their eyebrows during the interaction, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially signaling truthfulness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also function as a subtle cue to mask uncertainty or discomfort, sometimes associated with deceptive behavior. The upward and downward movements of the chin add another layer of complexity. A chin lifted upwards might suggest confidence or assertiveness, possibly reinforcing credibility. However, it could also be perceived as a defensive posture aimed at maintaining control when one feels challenged, which might hint at concealment. Similarly, the chin moving downwards might reflect thoughtfulness or humility, qualities consistent with honest engagement. Yet, the same downward motion could also signal submission or an effort to hide emotions, potentially indicative of deceit.

Their gaze patterns further complicate the interpretation. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor often conveys openness and attentiveness, supporting a perception of honesty. Nevertheless, sustained gaze can also be a deliberate strategy to mask dishonesty by projecting confidence. Sideways glances, on the other hand, are sometimes seen as signs of evasion or discomfort, which may raise suspicion about the truthfulness of their statements. Yet, side glances can equally represent moments of reflection or attempts to access memory, especially when recalling details, thus not necessarily implying deception. Given these ambiguous cues, it is essential to consider the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors, before drawing any definitive conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

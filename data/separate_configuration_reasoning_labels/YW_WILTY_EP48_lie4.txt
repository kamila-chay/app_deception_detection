The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest sincerity and engagement, as truthful individuals often seek to build trust through direct communication. On the other hand, prolonged or intense eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate for dishonesty, attempting to convey confidence and persuade the listener despite underlying fabrication. Similarly, the visible head tilting could be perceived as a sign of active listening and genuine interest, reflecting an openness to the conversation and a willingness to understand the interlocutor’s perspective. Conversely, head tilting might also indicate a calculated effort to appear submissive or non-threatening, potentially masking discomfort or evasiveness associated with deceptive behavior. Without additional contextual clues or baseline knowledge of the individual’s typical mannerisms, these behaviors remain ambiguous, and both truthful and deceptive interpretations hold plausible weight.

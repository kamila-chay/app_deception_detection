The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and truthfulness. Conversely, raised eyebrows could also be a calculated social cue intended to feign interest or innocence, potentially masking deceit. Frequent blinking is another ambiguous cue; on one hand, it might reflect cognitive load or anxiety that arises when someone is fabricating information. On the other hand, increased blinking could simply indicate discomfort, tiredness, or the natural physiological response to environmental factors, such as dry eyes or bright lighting.

The downward movement of the chin may be indicative of submission or the subject’s attempt to shield themselves emotionally, possibly pointing to discomfort or evasiveness. However, a lowered chin can also be a sign of concentration or contemplation, which would align with genuine engagement in the conversation. Similarly, the subject’s gaze upward is often considered a classic sign of mental construction or recall, which might suggest that they are trying to invent details. Yet, looking up can just as well correspond to sincere memory retrieval or reflection.

Sideways gazes carry their own dual interpretations. They may reveal attempts to avoid direct eye contact, which can be a red flag for deception in some contexts. Conversely, sideways glances can be the natural result of processing information, scanning the environment, or feeling social discomfort unrelated to lying. Head movements such as tilting, turning to the side, or lifting the head also provide mixed signals. A head tilt might express curiosity or openness, hinting at receptivity and honesty, yet it can equally be employed as a subtle distancing mechanism, a way to create space when feeling uneasy about disclosing information. Turning the head sideways could signify disengagement or avoidance but might just as well reflect active listening or even social politeness. Raising the head might project confidence or dominance, or it may be a subconscious gesture of defiance or resistance.

Ultimately, while these behaviors can offer valuable cues, each can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on context, individual differences, and situational factors. Without additional background information or corroborative evidence, it would be premature to conclusively categorize these signals as definitive indicators of truthfulness or deception.

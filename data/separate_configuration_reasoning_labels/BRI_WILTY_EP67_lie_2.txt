The subject maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. Such direct eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, reflecting genuine engagement in the conversation. Conversely, sustained gaze could also be a deliberate attempt to appear truthful, masking underlying deceit through overcompensation. Their glance upward similarly opens avenues for interpretation; it could signify cognitive processing as they attempt to recall information accurately, or alternatively, it might indicate mental distancing while constructing a fabricated narrative. The sideways gaze further complicates the picture, as it might reveal distraction or discomfort typically associated with deception, yet it can equally be a natural response to environmental stimuli or a cognitive strategy to access memories. Lastly, the palms-up gesture is often perceived as a sign of openness and sincerity, signaling willingness to communicate transparently. However, this same gesture might be consciously employed to elicit trust and soften suspicion when the subject is not entirely forthcoming. Each behavior alone is ambiguous and must be evaluated within the broader conversational and contextual framework to draw a more informed conclusion.

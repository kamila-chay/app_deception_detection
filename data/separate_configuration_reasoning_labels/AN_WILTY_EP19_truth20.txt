The individual’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, these behaviors could suggest genuine positive emotions, signaling comfort and truthfulness, as a sincere smile typically engages the muscles around the eyes and reflects heartfelt feelings. Conversely, these same expressions can be deliberately employed to manipulate or mask true emotions, serving as a social lubricant to deflect suspicion or create a façade of honesty. The gaze directed downward also invites dual interpretations. It may indicate discomfort or anxiety, potentially signaling internal conflict or deceit, as avoiding direct eye contact is often linked to attempts to conceal information. Alternatively, looking down can be a natural response to deep thought, introspection, or modesty, and in some individuals, it might simply be a habitual mannerism rather than a cue to dishonesty. Each of these behaviors, therefore, must be considered within the broader context of the interaction and corroborated with additional verbal and nonverbal cues before drawing conclusions about the person’s truthfulness or deception.

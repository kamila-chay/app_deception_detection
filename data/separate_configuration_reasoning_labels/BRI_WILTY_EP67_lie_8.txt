The individual’s sideways gaze can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context of their behavior and the situation. On one hand, avoiding direct eye contact by looking sideways might suggest an attempt to distance themselves from the conversation, which could point to discomfort or the possibility of withholding information, potentially signaling deception. Such a gaze shift can be perceived as a subtle way to evade scrutiny or to mentally distance themselves from the narrative they are presenting. On the other hand, looking sideways may simply reflect a natural and unconscious response during moments of thought or recall, as people often avert their gaze to concentrate or retrieve information from memory. It could also indicate distraction or environmental awareness, rather than any intent to deceive. Without considering additional contextual cues such as changes in voice tone, facial expressions, or the content of their speech, it is difficult to definitively assign meaning to the sideways gaze alone. Therefore, while this behavior might raise questions about truthfulness, it is equally plausible that it is an ordinary expression of cognitive processing or situational factors unrelated to deception.

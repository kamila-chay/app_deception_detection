The individual’s scowl and frowning eyebrows could suggest discomfort or displeasure, which might indicate an internal struggle with concealing the truth or dealing with guilt. Alternatively, these facial expressions could simply reflect concentration, frustration, or a natural response to an emotionally charged or stressful situation unrelated to deception. Their exaggerated eye opening might be interpreted as an attempt to appear more sincere or truthful, potentially compensating for underlying dishonesty. Conversely, it could also be a genuine reaction to surprise, disbelief, or an effort to pay close attention, thereby enhancing communication rather than masking it.

The movements of the chin—both upwards and downwards—introduce further complexity in interpretation. A chin lifted might be perceived as a sign of defensiveness or an attempt to assert dominance and control in a conversation, possibly as a tactic to deflect suspicion. At the same time, it could equally be a natural posture shift or a response to emotional vulnerability or discomfort. Meanwhile, a chin moving downward could suggest submission or hesitation, which some might associate with evasiveness or uncertainty. Yet, it might just as well indicate introspection or a moment of processing information before responding. Lastly, the subject’s shrugging gestures might be viewed as nonverbal cues of ambiguity or evasiveness, potentially signaling uncertainty in their statements or a subconscious admission of withholding information. On the other hand, shrugs are also common expressions of genuine lack of knowledge, doubt, or resignation, and therefore do not necessarily imply deception.

Ultimately, these behaviors need to be contextualized within the broader interaction and individual baseline behavior to make a well-grounded assessment of truthfulness or deception.

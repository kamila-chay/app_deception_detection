The individual's frowning eyebrows might suggest concern or discomfort, which could be interpreted as signs of stress commonly associated with deception. However, such a facial expression can equally reflect genuine concentration or worry about the topic being discussed, rather than an intent to deceive. Their mouth remains closed, which could imply hesitance to share information or withhold details, possibly indicating deceit. Conversely, a closed mouth might simply reflect careful consideration before responding or a natural communication style. The downward pull of the lip corners can be seen as an expression of sadness or unease, potentially hinting at guilt or fabricated emotions. Yet, it could also be a genuine emotional response to the subject matter, unrelated to any untruthfulness.

The upward movement of the chin might be interpreted as a subtle display of defensiveness or an attempt to project confidence while concealing dishonesty. On the other hand, this gesture could signal genuine assertiveness or engagement in the conversation. Their gaze alternates between looking towards the interlocutor and glancing down, which some might view as a sign of evasiveness or internal conflict, typical in deceptive behavior. Still, this pattern can also indicate thoughtful reflection or emotional processing, with downward glances serving to access memories rather than avoid scrutiny. The head tilt may be perceived as a nonverbal cue of uncertainty or discomfort, possibly stemming from fabricating information. Alternatively, it could reveal curiosity or an open-minded attitude towards the discussion.

Finally, the open positioning of the arms might be interpreted as a non-defensive, honest posture, signaling openness and a willingness to communicate transparently. Yet, in certain contexts, this same gesture could be employed strategically to appear more trustworthy and disarm suspicion while concealing deception. Taken together, these behaviors present a complex interplay of signals that require further contextual information to accurately discern the truthfulness of the individual’s statements.

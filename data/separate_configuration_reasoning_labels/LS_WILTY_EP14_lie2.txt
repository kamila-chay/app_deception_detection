The subject’s gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing downward, a pattern that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Direct eye contact may suggest confidence and honesty, reflecting their engagement and willingness to communicate openly. Conversely, it could be a deliberate attempt to appear trustworthy while masking deceit. Meanwhile, looking down might indicate discomfort or evasion, potentially signaling that the person is withholding information. However, it could also simply reflect a moment of reflection or the natural rhythm of conversation, rather than deception.

Their head movements—leaning forward and turning to the side—also invite dual interpretations. Moving the head forward might demonstrate attentiveness and active involvement, reinforcing the impression that the individual is sincere and eager to clarify their point. On the other hand, such movement could be a subconscious tactic to appear more persuasive or to gauge the reaction of the interlocutor, possibly masking uncertainty. The side-turn of the head may signal thoughtfulness or the process of recalling information, yet it could equally be read as a subtle attempt to avoid direct confrontation or hide true feelings.

Finally, the openness of their arms can be seen as a welcoming, transparent posture, conveying honesty and openness. It may indicate that the person has nothing to hide and is comfortable in the interaction. Conversely, this same open posture might be a conscious effort to appear disarming and trustworthy, especially if paired with other subtle signs of discomfort or inconsistencies. Without additional context, such as verbal cues or situational background, these behaviors remain ambiguous, underscoring the complexity of accurately discerning truthfulness solely through nonverbal signals.

The individual’s smile, accompanied by the corners of the lips turning upward, might suggest genuine friendliness or comfort in the situation, signaling honesty. However, the smile could also be a carefully controlled expression intended to mask discomfort or to feign sincerity, especially when paired with other subtle cues. Conversely, the moments when the lip corners turn downward may reflect a fleeting emotion of sadness or disapproval, possibly an authentic reaction to the topic at hand. Yet, such expressions can also be consciously or unconsciously employed to evoke sympathy or to divert attention during a deceptive narrative.

The presence of lips protruding might be interpreted as a sign of tension or suppressed frustration, which could indicate internal conflict when fabricating details. On the other hand, it can simply be a habitual or neutral lip movement without any deceptive implications. Similarly, lips being retracted might reveal defensiveness or an attempt to restrain speech, potentially highlighting discomfort with the truth. Alternatively, this could be a natural facial posture unrelated to dishonesty.

When observing the upward movement of the chin, one might consider it a display of confidence, possibly reinforcing the person’s credibility. However, it could equally represent a defensive posture, an attempt to assert dominance or deflect suspicion. The downward gaze may indicate shame, guilt, or avoidance frequently linked with deception, but it might just as well show thoughtfulness or respect, depending on cultural or situational context. Sideways glances can be especially ambiguous; they might betray evasiveness or attempts to create fabricated details, yet they might also reflect cognitive processing or trying to recall specific information.

Lastly, the openness of the arms generally conveys approachability and openness, potentially suggesting truthfulness. Alternatively, open arms might be a strategic gesture to appear non-threatening and build trust when the person is actually concealing their true intentions. Each of these behaviors, therefore, needs to be assessed in the broader context of the interaction and baseline behavior to draw more confident conclusions about potential deception.

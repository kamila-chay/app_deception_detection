The subject’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or the effort to emphasize honesty and openness, suggesting they are being truthful. Conversely, it could be a subtle expression of disbelief or discomfort, potentially indicating they are fabricating or concealing information. Similarly, their gaze shifting sideways might be perceived as an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which some argue is a classic sign of deception. Yet, such a sideways glance could equally reflect their attempt to gather thoughts or recall details accurately, pointing toward genuine engagement rather than deceit. The backward movement of the head introduces ambiguity as well; it could be an unconscious distancing behavior linked to discomfort or defensiveness, hinting at possible dishonesty. Alternatively, this gesture could simply indicate reflection or a moment of processing information, not necessarily tied to deceptive intentions. Finally, the open palms gesture traditionally conveys openness and honesty, reinforcing the possibility of truthful communication. However, open palms can also be employed strategically to appear more trustworthy and mask insincerity. Ultimately, these behaviors require careful consideration within the broader context of verbal cues, baseline behaviors, and situational factors to more reliably discern the subject’s truthfulness.

The subject's frowning eyebrows may suggest concern or discomfort, which could be interpreted as a sign of stress potentially linked to concealing information or fabricating a story. Such an expression might indicate an internal struggle or hesitation common in deceptive behavior. Conversely, this same furrowing of the brow might simply reflect concentration, confusion, or genuine emotional distress unrelated to deception. It could be a natural reaction to a challenging question or an attempt to process complex information thoughtfully.

Similarly, the downward turn of the lip corners can be viewed through multiple lenses. On one hand, this expression may signify displeasure, frustration, or even guilt, which might align with feelings experienced during deception. The individual could be subconsciously expressing regret or discomfort associated with withholding truth. On the other hand, these lip movements might just as well denote sadness, disappointment, or sincere dissatisfaction with the topic at hand, entirely consistent with truthful emotions. Without additional context, such as baseline behavior or verbal cues, these facial expressions alone cannot definitively indicate deceit or honesty. Both interpretations underscore the importance of situational factors and the broader behavioral pattern when forming a judgment.

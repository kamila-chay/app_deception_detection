The individual’s downward gaze might be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or evasiveness, potentially suggesting that they are avoiding eye contact to conceal deceit. Such behavior could indicate an attempt to distance themselves from the situation or to mask uncertainty about the truth. Conversely, this same action might simply reflect introspection, shyness, or cultural norms where direct eye contact is not customary, which does not necessarily imply dishonesty. Their palms-up gesture can be seen as a nonverbal appeal for understanding or an expression of openness, possibly signaling a willingness to be truthful and transparent. However, this same gesture might also be employed strategically to appear sincere and trustworthy, even if the person is being deceptive. Without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, these behaviors remain ambiguous and can support equally plausible interpretations of honesty or deception.

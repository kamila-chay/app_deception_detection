The subject’s expression with lip corners turned upward might suggest a genuine smile, possibly indicating comfort and sincerity in the interaction. Conversely, this gesture could also be a controlled or polite smile, employed strategically to mask discomfort or conceal the truth. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor generally reflects engagement and openness, which might be interpreted as a sign of honesty and willingness to communicate transparently. However, direct eye contact can also be consciously maintained by someone attempting to appear credible, potentially to distract from deceptive intent.

Meanwhile, the occasional sideways gaze introduces ambiguity; it could imply distraction or discomfort, sometimes associated with the cognitive load of fabricating information. On the other hand, such glances might simply reflect natural moments of thought or attempts to access memory, rather than signaling deceit. The open position of the arms typically conveys receptiveness and a lack of defensiveness, lending weight to the assumption of truthful behavior. Yet, open arms can be deliberately adopted to project an image of openness and trustworthiness, even when the person’s words may not align with reality.

Given these behaviors, it is essential to consider the broader context and additional cues before drawing a definitive conclusion, as each action holds the potential for both honest and deceptive interpretations.

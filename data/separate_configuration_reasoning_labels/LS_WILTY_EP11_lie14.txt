The person’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signal discomfort or cognitive strain often associated with fabricating information or concealing the truth. Conversely, the same furrowed brows could simply reflect concentration or frustration related to recalling details or processing complex questions, without any deceptive intent. Their chin movements, both upwards and downwards, add another layer of ambiguity. Raising the chin might be perceived as an assertive or defensive gesture, possibly indicating a desire to appear confident in an untruthful statement. On the other hand, lowering the chin could suggest submission or contemplation, which could mean they are genuinely reflecting on their responses rather than being deceptive.

The gaze behavior shows a dynamic pattern between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking down. Eye contact is often touted as a marker of honesty, so their direct gaze could support the idea that they are truthful. However, persistent eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate attempt to convince or manipulate, suggesting possible deception. Conversely, glancing downward may signal discomfort or evasiveness, which some interpret as a red flag for dishonesty; yet, it could equally represent shyness, respect, or simply the process of internalizing information.

Their head movements, including moving forward and backward, as well as head tilting and keeping the head up, also present dual interpretations. Moving the head forward could indicate engagement and eagerness to communicate honestly, but it might also be an attempt to assert dominance or control the interaction when fabricating a story. Moving the head backward can suggest withdrawal or distancing, which might arise from the stress of lying or merely from feeling uncertain or overwhelmed in the discussion. Tilting the head is often seen as a curiosity or an attempt to understand better, potentially signaling honesty, yet it can also be used strategically to appear more empathetic or cooperative while being deceptive. Maintaining the head up posture may convey confidence and openness, supporting the trustworthiness of their statements; alternatively, it might reflect overcompensation to mask insecurity or dishonesty.

Given these varied behaviors, it is crucial to consider the broader context and baseline tendencies of the individual to discern whether these nonverbal cues point toward truthfulness or deception. Without additional information, each behavior remains open to multiple interpretations, underscoring the complexity of accurately assessing honesty based solely on these visible signals.

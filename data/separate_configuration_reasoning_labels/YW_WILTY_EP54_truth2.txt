The subject’s smile can be interpreted in multiple ways; it might serve as a genuine expression of friendliness and openness, suggesting sincerity, while alternatively, it could be a strategic attempt to mask discomfort or to feign honesty. The act of raising eyebrows similarly holds dual meanings: it may signal surprise or engagement, implying truthful attentiveness, or conversely, it could indicate skepticism or an exaggerated effort to convince, hinting at possible deception. The upward movement of the chin might be read as confidence and assertiveness, reinforcing credibility, yet it could just as well be perceived as a defensive posture designed to assert dominance or deflect scrutiny. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor often conveys openness and connection, which can be a hallmark of honest communication, but intermittent or purposeful eye contact can also function as a rehearsed tactic to appear trustworthy. When the gaze shifts downward, it might reveal genuine reflection or modesty, but it can also suggest discomfort or a subconscious attempt to evade direct engagement. Finally, the palms being held up is a classic gesture often associated with openness and transparency, signaling that the person has nothing to hide; however, it can also be consciously employed as a deliberate calming or persuasive gesture meant to manipulate the perception of honesty. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors demands a nuanced understanding of the broader situational context, as each cue can be both a sign of truthful communication or a mask for deception depending on the interplay of other verbal and nonverbal signals.

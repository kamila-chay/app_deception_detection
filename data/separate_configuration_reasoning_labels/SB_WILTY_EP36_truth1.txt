The subject's gaze towards the interlocutor could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest honesty and engagement, reflecting confidence and openness in the communication. Conversely, this direct gaze could also be a deliberate attempt to appear truthful while masking deceit, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to persuade or distract from inconsistencies. When the subject looks down, this behavior might indicate feelings of guilt, shame, or discomfort, which could align with concealing the truth. However, looking down can also be a natural reaction during moments of introspection or when formulating a thoughtful response, unrelated to deception. The head side-turn similarly presents a dual interpretation. It might be a subtle distancing gesture, signaling reluctance or an attempt to avoid full engagement with the topic, which some literature associates with dishonesty. Alternatively, it could simply be a habitual or cultural expression of contemplation or politeness, bearing no direct connection to deceit. Ultimately, without additional contextual information such as verbal cues, baseline behavior, and situational factors, these nonverbal signals remain ambiguous, and both truthful and deceptive intentions remain plausible.

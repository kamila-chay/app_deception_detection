The subject's scowl and frowning eyebrows might suggest discomfort or distress, which could be interpreted as signs of deceit, possibly reflecting internal conflict or anxiety about fabricating information. Conversely, these expressions might simply indicate genuine concern or concentration, especially if the topic at hand is emotionally charged or complex. The downward turn of the lip corners often conveys displeasure or sadness; in the context of deception, this could be a subconscious attempt to mask the truth or a stress response. However, it could equally represent sincere feelings of regret, frustration, or disappointment that are unrelated to dishonesty.

The movements of the chin, alternately moving upwards and downwards, might be read as signs of uncertainty or hesitation—potentially indicative of someone carefully constructing a narrative or weighed down by the pressure to maintain a falsehood. On the other hand, such motions might simply reflect natural shifts in posture or a search for the right words, common in thoughtful communication. The sideways gaze and accompanying head turn might raise suspicion as evasive behaviors, possibly signaling an effort to avoid direct engagement or scrutiny when fabricating information. Yet, these behaviors can also be manifestations of cognitive processing, as individuals often glance away to access memory or organize their thoughts when responding honestly.

Ultimately, while these combined behaviors could raise questions about the subject’s truthfulness, they are also consistent with a range of innocuous emotional or cognitive states. Without further contextual information—such as baseline behavior, the nature of the interaction, and verbal cues—it remains challenging to definitively interpret these nonverbal signals as indicators of deception or sincerity.

The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, the furrowed brows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which could be indicative of someone who is fabricating information or feeling uneasy about hiding the truth. This subtle tension in the facial muscles may reflect the mental effort involved in constructing a story or the stress of potential exposure. On the other hand, frowning can also simply reflect genuine confusion, frustration, or deep thought about the topic at hand, rather than any intent to deceive. It might just as well be a natural response to a difficult question or an emotional reaction to a troubling subject, which does not necessarily imply dishonesty.

Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows can be viewed through contrasting lenses. Raised eyebrows often signal surprise or incredulity, which could be part of a deceptive display aimed at feigning innocence or shock to deflect suspicion. This expression may be deliberately exaggerated to convey honesty or to gain the interlocutor’s trust. Conversely, raised eyebrows are also a common spontaneous reaction to unexpected information or emotional stimuli and can indicate genuine astonishment or a desire to engage more fully with the conversation. This behavior might simply reflect openness or curiosity rather than any manipulative intent.

Given these nuances, the interpretations of both frowning and raised eyebrows are heavily context-dependent. Without additional behavioral cues or background information, it is difficult to definitively classify these expressions as signs of truthfulness or deception. They remain ambiguous indicators that warrant careful consideration alongside other elements of the interaction.

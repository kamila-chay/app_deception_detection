The subject’s gaze shifting upwards can be interpreted in different ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, looking up might suggest that they are accessing visual memories or trying to reconstruct details from their recollection, which could indicate honesty as they attempt to provide accurate information. Conversely, this upward gaze might also be a sign of fabrication, as some theories propose that people look away from their immediate environment when constructing deceptive narratives. Similarly, the sideways gaze offers dual possibilities. It could reflect distraction or discomfort stemming from the stress of maintaining a falsehood, signaling potential deception. Alternatively, it might simply indicate natural cognitive processing or the act of considering a question thoughtfully, which is consistent with truthfulness. Without additional context such as verbal content, physiological cues, or baseline behavior, these eye movements alone do not conclusively point to either honesty or deception. Hence, careful analysis of the overall situation and corroborating evidence is essential to draw a more reliable conclusion.

The subject's smile, characterized by the upward movement of the lip corners, could be interpreted in two distinct ways. On one hand, a genuine smile often signals positive emotions and honesty, suggesting comfort and openness in the interaction. Conversely, a smile can also be a strategic tool to mask discomfort or to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception, potentially indicating an attempt to deceive. The raising of the eyebrows adds another layer of complexity. This gesture might reflect genuine surprise or engagement, signifying attentive and truthful communication. However, raised eyebrows can also serve as a feigned expression designed to elicit trust or to divert suspicion when someone is fabricating information.

The subject’s gaze behavior is equally ambiguous. Maintaining eye contact typically conveys confidence and sincerity, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. Yet, it is important to note that sustained gaze can also be consciously employed to overwhelm or influence the interlocutor, thus masking deceit. The intermittent gaze downward introduces a contrasting element; it might indicate discomfort or cognitive processing involved in constructing a narrative, which could hint at deceit. Alternatively, this downward glance could simply reflect natural momentary breaks in eye contact, associated with recalling information or reflecting internally during a truthful exchange.

Finally, the subtle head tilting observed might be a sign of empathy and engagement, characteristics commonly linked to honest communication. However, this same behavior could also be a calculated effort to appear more likable and persuasive, thus serving as a potential red flag for deceptive intent. Given these behaviors, without additional contextual cues or corroborative evidence, it remains challenging to definitively categorize the subject’s truthfulness. Each of these nonverbal signals can support interpretations in both directions, underscoring the necessity for a holistic assessment when evaluating potential deception.

The person’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing their truthfulness. On one hand, this expression might suggest concentration or discomfort that arises from trying to construct a deceptive narrative, signaling internal conflict or stress associated with dishonesty. Conversely, frowning could simply be a natural reaction to processing complex information or an emotional response unrelated to deceit, such as frustration or confusion caused by the conversation topic itself. Their steady gaze toward the interlocutor also presents a dual possibility. Maintaining eye contact can indicate confidence and sincerity, reflecting openness and a willingness to engage truthfully. On the other hand, it might be a deliberate strategy to counteract suspicions or to mask deceit, as individuals sometimes overcompensate by holding eye contact to appear more credible. Ultimately, the meaning of these behaviors depends greatly on the broader context, including baseline behavioral patterns, the nature of the discussion, and other verbal or nonverbal cues present during the interaction.

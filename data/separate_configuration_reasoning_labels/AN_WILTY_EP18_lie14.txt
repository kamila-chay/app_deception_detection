The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest honesty, as maintaining eye contact is often associated with openness and confidence in one’s statements. Conversely, prolonged or intense eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, attempting to convince the listener through assertiveness. Their nodding could be interpreted as a sign of engagement and agreement, reinforcing the sincerity of their communication. However, it could equally be a rehearsed behavior, employed to create an illusion of cooperation or to encourage the interlocutor to accept fabricated information without question. The presence of palms facing upward generally signals openness and honesty, potentially reflecting a genuine willingness to be transparent. Yet, this same gesture might be consciously used to appear non-threatening or sincere, even if the underlying message is deceptive. Ultimately, without considering the broader context of the interaction and additional nonverbal cues, each of these behaviors can be reasonably viewed as either indicators of truthfulness or as calculated elements of a deceptive performance.

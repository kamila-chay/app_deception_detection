The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might suggest a genuine positive emotional state, which could imply honesty and openness during the interaction. However, such expressions can also be consciously employed to mask discomfort or to project an image of confidence, potentially serving as a façade to mislead. Their raising of eyebrows may indicate surprise or engagement, possibly reflecting authentic reactions to the conversation, yet it could equally represent a deliberate attempt to feign interest or innocence.

Frequent blinking is often linked to increased cognitive load or stress, which some interpret as a marker of deception. Conversely, it may simply be a physiological response to nervousness unrelated to dishonesty, or even normal eye moisture maintenance. The subject’s alternating gaze—both towards the interlocutor and downward—adds complexity to the interpretation. Direct eye contact can be a sign of sincerity, indicating attentiveness and honesty, but in certain cases, it might be maintained deliberately to appear truthful. Conversely, looking downward could signify discomfort and possibly concealment of deceit, yet it is also commonly a natural reaction when processing difficult information or reflecting.

Their hands engaging in rubbing and touching various parts of their body, including covering the face or mouth, might be interpreted as self-soothing gestures stemming from anxiety related to deception. Yet, these actions can also be habitual mannerisms or responses to environmental factors like temperature or stress unrelated to truthfulness. The openness of their arms could signal a relaxed and open demeanor, suggestive of honesty, but alternatively, it might be a strategic display aimed at creating trust and lowering the interlocutor’s defenses.

In sum, each behavior displayed by the subject carries a dual potential interpretation. Without additional context or baseline behavioral knowledge, these signals alone cannot definitively denote truthfulness or deception. A holistic assessment that considers the interplay of these cues alongside verbal content and situational factors would be necessary for a more informed judgment.

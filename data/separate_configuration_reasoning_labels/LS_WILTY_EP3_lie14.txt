The individual’s smile and lip corners turning upward can be seen as signs of genuine friendliness and confidence in their communication. However, such expressions might also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to deceptively project sincerity. The act of raising the eyebrows may indicate surprise or engagement, suggesting openness, but depending on the context, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear truthful or emphasize certain points while concealing deceit.

Their mouth remaining closed and lips retracted might reflect careful thought or restraint, potentially signaling honesty in avoiding embellishment. Conversely, this behavior could denote tension or a conscious effort to suppress truthful disclosure. The gaze behavior is particularly nuanced: maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor often conveys attentiveness and truthfulness, yet occasional downward or sideways glances could signal evasion or internal conflict related to deceptive intentions. Alternatively, these gaze shifts might simply reflect cognitive processing or recalling information.

Head movements, such as leaning forward and tilting, can express interest and engagement, reinforcing the perception of openness in communication. On the other hand, such movements might be unconscious attempts to appear more convincing or to subtly manipulate the listener’s perception. The subject’s hand behaviors add another layer of complexity; rubbing hands and touching the head or body might reveal nervousness or discomfort associated with dishonesty, but these gestures can equally represent self-soothing behaviors common in stressful but truthful situations. Covering the face or mouth with hands might indicate an effort to hide something, whether it is falsehood or a moment of vulnerability or hesitation.

Finally, the openness of the arms generally suggests receptiveness and lack of defensiveness, supporting an interpretation of honesty. Still, open arms can also be a calculated posture to build trust and reduce suspicion. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues and knowledge of baseline behaviors, these observable signals alone cannot definitively determine deception or truthfulness—they should be integrated carefully with other information for a more accurate assessment.

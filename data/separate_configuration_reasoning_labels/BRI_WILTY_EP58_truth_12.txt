The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest honesty and engagement, as people who are truthful often feel comfortable maintaining visual connection. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate strategy to project sincerity and confidence, potentially masking deceptive intentions. Meanwhile, the occasional sideways glances introduce further ambiguity. Such glances might indicate discomfort or evasiveness, which some interpret as signs of deceit or attempts to avoid scrutiny. However, these same glances can also be innocuous—perhaps the person is thoughtfully processing information, recalling details, or momentarily distracted by external stimuli. Ultimately, without broader contextual cues or understanding of the individual’s baseline behavior, the observed gaze patterns alone are insufficient to definitively conclude truthfulness or deception.

Conversely, such an expression might simply reflect confusion, frustration, or deep thought related to the topic at hand. Their chin movements, alternating between upwards and downwards, might be interpreted as attempts to assert dominance or defensiveness, possibly signaling hesitation or concealment. On the other hand, these gestures could also be natural variations in posture or a response to physical discomfort, unrelated to deception. They maintain gaze towards the interlocutor, which might indicate confidence and openness, yet when coupled with occasional downward glances, it could also hint at avoidance or struggle with truthfulness. However, looking down may equally denote reflection or processing emotions rather than evasiveness. The sideways and tilting movements of the head could be perceived as signs of uncertainty or an effort to disengage, which might be associated with deceptive behavior. Alternatively, these motions might simply be habitual gestures or attempts to better understand the conversation. Head shaking might suggest disagreement or denial, possibly masking falsehoods, but it might also genuinely convey heartfelt disagreement or confusion. Their hands frequently touch their head or body and occasionally cover parts of their face or mouth, actions that might signal nervousness or attempts to self-soothe during deception. Yet, such gestures can also be innocuous, stemming from habitual mannerisms or moments of reflection. Overall, each behavior observed holds dual interpretations, underscoring the importance of contextual information in drawing any definitive conclusions about their truthfulness.

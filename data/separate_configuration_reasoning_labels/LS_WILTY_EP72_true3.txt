The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and openness, indicating that the person is truthful and engaged in the conversation. On the other hand, sustained eye contact could also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere and mask deceptive intentions, using direct gazes to persuade or manipulate. When the individual shifts their gaze downward, this behavior similarly offers dual interpretations. It might represent a moment of reflection or genuine discomfort when recalling details, signaling honesty and thoughtfulness. Conversely, a downward gaze can sometimes be associated with avoidance or guilt, hinting at possible concealment or fabrication of information. The subject’s shrug adds another layer of complexity; it could be a natural gesture expressing uncertainty or admitting the limits of their knowledge, thereby supporting a truthful stance. Alternatively, the shrug might be employed as a nonverbal tactic to deflect responsibility or evade providing a direct answer, which could be indicative of deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors should be analyzed in conjunction with broader contextual cues and additional information before drawing any firm conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

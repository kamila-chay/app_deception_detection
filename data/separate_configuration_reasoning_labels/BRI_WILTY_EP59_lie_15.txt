The subject’s lips are retracted, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, this expression might signal tension or discomfort, potentially indicative of someone suppressing the truth or feeling anxious about being deceptive. Conversely, this gesture could simply reflect a natural facial expression linked to concentration or emotional neutrality, without any deceptive intent. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and willingness to communicate openly. This direct eye contact might support the idea of honesty, as individuals tend to avoid looking directly at someone when deceiving. However, it is also possible that the person is consciously maintaining eye contact as a strategy to appear more credible or truthful than they actually are.

At other moments, the subject’s gaze shifts upward, which some interpret as a retrieval of visual memories, potentially indicating thoughtful reflection or attempts to reconstruct a truthful account. Yet, upward gaze has also been theorized as a sign of fabricated information, as individuals might look up when inventing details. Similarly, the occasional sideways glance can be viewed through a dual lens. It may suggest that the person is feeling uneasy or distracted, possibly due to the discomfort associated with deception. Alternatively, these side glances might be innocuous behaviors linked to normal cognitive processing or momentary shifts in attention. Without additional context, such as the subject’s baseline behavior or the emotional environment, it remains challenging to definitively categorize their behavior as truthful or deceptive.

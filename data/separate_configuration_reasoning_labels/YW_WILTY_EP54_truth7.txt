The subject’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might suggest surprise or uncertainty, which could be a subtle cue to discomfort often associated with deceptive behavior. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also simply indicate genuine interest or attentiveness, reflecting an openness and engagement with the interlocutor rather than concealment. Their mouth remaining closed might imply restraint or hesitation, potentially signaling an attempt to withhold information or carefully control their responses, traits sometimes linked to deception. However, a closed mouth can equally be a neutral or polite gesture, possibly reflecting thoughtful listening or a natural tendency to remain silent until fully processing the conversation. The direct gaze towards the interlocutor adds another layer of complexity; maintaining eye contact might be seen as an effort to appear honest and trustworthy, which can be a strategy employed by someone attempting to deceive. Alternatively, steady eye contact is commonly associated with sincerity and confidence, suggesting that the person is open and truthful. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues or background information, these behaviors alone provide ambiguous signals that could equally support interpretations of truthfulness or deception.

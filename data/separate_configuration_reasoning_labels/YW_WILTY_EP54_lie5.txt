They are raising their eyebrows, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture may indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize truthfulness, as people often raise their eyebrows to express sincerity or to engage their listener more effectively. On the other hand, raised eyebrows might also serve as a subtle cue of deception, potentially signaling discomfort or uncertainty as the subject tries to process or fabricate a response. Their gaze remains directed toward the interlocutor, which could suggest openness and confidence in their statements, reflecting a willingness to engage honestly. Conversely, maintaining eye contact might be a deliberate strategy to appear truthful, as some individuals are trained or naturally inclined to hold steady eye contact to mask deceit. Additionally, their palms are facing upward, a posture frequently associated with openness and honesty, possibly signaling a genuine attempt to communicate transparently. Yet, this same gesture could be consciously employed to appear more trustworthy and thereby manipulate the perception of the listener. Given these behaviors, interpretation depends heavily on the broader context, the individual's baseline mannerisms, and the situational nuances to draw a more definitive conclusion about their truthfulness.

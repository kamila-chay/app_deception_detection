The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact is often associated with openness and sincerity, suggesting the person is engaged and truthful in the conversation. It might indicate they have nothing to conceal and are confident in what they are sharing. On the other hand, steady eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear believable and to mask deceit. A person who is fabricating information may maintain intense gaze to convince the listener of their honesty, using eye contact as a tool to manipulate perceptions.

Similarly, the palms-up gesture carries ambiguous implications. Palms facing upwards are commonly viewed as a sign of honesty, vulnerability, and openness, implying the subject is being transparent and welcoming of scrutiny. This posture can suggest a willingness to cooperate and communicate truthfully. Alternatively, this gesture may be consciously employed to feign sincerity, presenting an inviting demeanor to distract from underlying deception. The palms-up posture could be part of a rehearsed or unconscious attempt to project credibility, regardless of the authenticity of their statements.

In sum, both the gaze towards the interlocutor and the palms-up gesture can be interpreted as indicators of truthful behavior or as deliberate cues designed to enhance credibility. Without additional contextual information or corroborating evidence, these behaviors alone provide an inconclusive picture, emphasizing the need for a broader analysis to reliably assess the subject’s truthfulness.

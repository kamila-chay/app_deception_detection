The person’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest concentration or stress, potentially linked to the cognitive effort of fabricating information or concealing the truth. On the other hand, frowning can simply reflect genuine concern, confusion, or the seriousness of the topic being discussed, without any deceptive intent. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows can carry dual meanings; it might signal surprise or disbelief, which could be a reaction when trying to maintain a deception, or it might be a sincere involuntary response to new or unexpected information. Their sustained gaze toward the interlocutor is another behavior open to interpretation. While direct eye contact might be seen as an attempt to convince or dominate, sometimes even a rehearsed feature of deceit, it can equally represent honesty, attentiveness, and engagement in the conversation. Nodding during the interaction adds another layer of complexity. It might be a subtle way of agreeing to reinforce fabricated points, or a natural indication of agreement and active listening. Lastly, the folded arms posture is often interpreted as a defensive or guarded stance, which might hint at discomfort associated with deception. Conversely, crossed arms can also simply denote a habitual posture or reflect feelings of coldness or fatigue, rather than any deceitful mindset. Ultimately, without additional context and understanding of the person’s baseline behaviors, it is challenging to definitively determine whether these signals point toward truthfulness or deception.

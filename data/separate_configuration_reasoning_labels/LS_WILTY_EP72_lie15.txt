The subject's smile can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. A genuine smile might indicate comfort and honesty, reflecting positive engagement with the conversation. Conversely, a smile could be a social mask intended to conceal discomfort or to manipulate the listener, potentially signaling deceit. The act of raising eyebrows similarly carries dual meanings: it may express surprise or openness, suggesting sincere responsiveness, yet it could also be an exaggerated gesture meant to persuade or distract from underlying dishonesty.

Exaggerated eye closing can be seen as a natural response to tension or thoughtfulness, possibly indicating internal processing or hesitation associated with truthful recollection. Alternatively, it might be a deliberate attempt to shield the eyes and avoid revealing subtle emotional cues, which some interpret as a sign of deception. The downward movement of the chin may signal contemplation or submission, behaviors consistent with honest reflection. At the same time, this gesture can be interpreted as a way to momentarily disengage or hide vulnerability, potentially linked to deceptive intentions.

Finally, maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor is a complex behavior; it can indicate confidence, openness, and a genuine desire to connect. Yet, prolonged eye contact might also be consciously maintained to overcompensate for dishonesty, aiming to project truthfulness despite underlying deceit. In all, these behaviors must be contextualized within the broader interaction, and without additional information, it remains equally plausible that they reflect sincere communication or subtle attempts at concealment.

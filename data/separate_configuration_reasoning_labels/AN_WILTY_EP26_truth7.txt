The subject’s chin movements, alternating between upward and downward positions, can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, these motions might suggest an attempt to control or conceal emotions, which could be linked to deceptive behavior. Conversely, such movements may simply reflect natural shifts in posture or moments of contemplation, indicating attentiveness rather than deceit. Their gaze behavior is also nuanced; maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor could signal honesty and engagement, yet it might equally be a deliberate effort to appear sincere while fabricating information. Similarly, occasional glances sideways might imply evasion or discomfort, commonly associated with deception, but could just as well represent the individual’s process of recalling or organizing thoughts. The nodding observed may be perceived as a sign of agreement and cooperation, which supports truthfulness, although it can also be employed as a strategic gesture to persuade or placate the listener during a deceptive interaction. The slight turning of the head to the side could denote openness and receptivity, aligning with honest communication, but alternatively, it might function as a subtle distancing cue, signaling discomfort or guardedness. Lastly, the presentation of palms upward is often viewed as a nonverbal appeal for trust and honesty, yet in certain contexts, it might be consciously used to feign sincerity or vulnerability. Ultimately, these behaviors must be interpreted within the broader situational context to draw more reliable conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness or deceptiveness.

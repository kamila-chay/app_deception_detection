The subject’s mouth remains closed with lips protruded, a behavior that could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, a closed mouth and pursed lips might suggest that the person is holding back information or feeling uneasy, which can be associated with deceptive intent. Conversely, this expression might simply reflect concentration or thoughtfulness, especially if the person is carefully considering their response or trying to articulate something complex. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking down. Direct eye contact might be perceived as a sign of confidence and honesty, as many associate sustained gaze with truthfulness. However, some individuals may deliberately maintain eye contact in an attempt to convince or manipulate, making it a potential indicator of deception in certain contexts. Meanwhile, looking down might be viewed as evasive or indicative of discomfort, possibly signaling dishonesty, yet it can also be an unconscious gesture linked to introspection or processing emotions, rather than an attempt to deceive. The head movements—tilting and turning to the side—add another layer of ambiguity. A tilted head could suggest a nonverbal cue of engagement and openness, or alternatively, it might reflect uncertainty or discomfort, which might be present during deception. Similarly, turning the head to the side could be interpreted as avoidance or distancing behavior, possibly hinting at untruthfulness, but it could just as well be a natural response to the conversational flow or a way of gathering thoughts. Ultimately, these behaviors, when considered individually or collectively, can support arguments both for and against the subject’s truthfulness. Without the broader context of the conversation and the individual’s baseline behavior, definitive conclusions remain elusive, underscoring the importance of holistic analysis in assessing potential deception.

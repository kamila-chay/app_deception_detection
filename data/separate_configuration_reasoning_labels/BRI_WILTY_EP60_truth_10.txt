The individual’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, raised eyebrows may indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, signaling engagement and transparency. Conversely, this gesture could also be a subconscious signal of uncertainty or an effort to deflect scrutiny, potentially hinting at discomfort associated with deceptive responses.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor similarly invites dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact is often seen as a sign of confidence and sincerity, suggesting that the person is more likely to be truthful. Yet, it is important to consider that deliberate eye contact can also be a conscious strategy employed to convince or manipulate, especially if it appears forced or overly intense, thereby casting doubt on the veracity of their words.

The upward gaze adds another layer of complexity. It might reflect an attempt to recall accurate information or engage in reflective thinking, which would support the notion of honesty. However, this same behavior could be indicative of fabricated storytelling or evasion, as looking upward can sometimes be associated with mentally constructing false narratives or avoiding direct confrontation.

In sum, each of these behaviors—raising eyebrows, steady gaze towards the interlocutor, and gaze upward—can be seen as markers of either truthfulness or deception depending on the broader context, the individual’s baseline behavior, and the dynamics of the interaction. Without additional information or corroborative cues, it remains challenging to draw a definitive conclusion based solely on these observable actions.

The individual’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could signal surprise or uncertainty, which might suggest they are processing information carefully, possibly in an effort to fabricate or modify a story. Conversely, raised eyebrows might simply reflect genuine curiosity or engagement with the conversation. Their chin movements—alternating between upward and downward tilts—add further complexity; an upward chin could indicate confidence or defiance, potentially masking deceit, while a downward tilt might reveal submission or contemplation, which can be consistent with either sincere reflection or strategizing to appear truthful. The subject’s gaze shifts between direct eye contact and looking sideways, a pattern that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often denotes honesty and transparency, yet it can also be a deliberate technique to assert credibility. On the other hand, sideways glances could betray discomfort or evasiveness, hinting at deception, but they might equally represent attempts to retrieve memories or process internal thoughts.

Their nodding during the interaction might be seen as a sign of rapport and agreement, helping to build trust, but it can also be a conscious effort to convince or appease the listener, raising questions about authenticity. Similarly, turning the head to the side could indicate openness and willingness to engage from a new perspective, or alternatively, it might be a subtle withdrawal or avoidance maneuver. The subject’s open arms generally project openness and honesty, suggesting a lack of hidden agendas; however, for someone skilled in nonverbal communication, it could be a rehearsed posture designed to deflect suspicion. Taken together, these behaviors alone do not conclusively reveal whether the person is truthful or deceptive. Instead, their interpretation heavily relies on additional contextual information, including verbal content, baseline behaviors, and situational factors, to arrive at a more reliable assessment.

They maintain steady gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest confidence and sincerity, indicating that the person is open and truthful in the interaction. In many cultures, steady gaze is associated with honesty and engagement, which could support the notion that their statements are genuine. Conversely, continuous eye contact may also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and to mask deception. Some individuals might overcompensate by maintaining unwavering gaze in an attempt to convince others of their truthfulness, especially if they are concealing information. Without additional cues or contextual understanding, it remains difficult to definitively determine whether this gaze behavior reflects transparency or a calculated effort to mislead.

The subject’s smile might be interpreted as a genuine expression of comfort and openness, suggesting honesty and confidence in their statements. However, smiles can also serve as a social mask to conceal discomfort or deceit, functioning as a polite or rehearsed response rather than an authentic emotional cue. Their tendency to gaze downwards could imply feelings of shame or guilt, which might be consistent with deceptive behavior. Conversely, looking down might simply reflect modesty, thoughtfulness, or a momentary shift in attention unrelated to dishonesty. When the subject glances sideways, it could be seen as a subtle attempt to avoid direct eye contact, potentially indicating evasiveness or fabrication. Alternatively, such sideways glances might be a natural part of cognitive processing, indicative of trying to recall information or carefully considering a response without any intent to deceive. The head tilting adds another layer of complexity; it may signal uncertainty or a subconscious effort to soften the interaction when being untruthful. On the other hand, head tilting can also convey genuine curiosity, engagement, or empathy, factors that do not necessarily correlate with deception. Each of these behavioral cues carries ambiguous meanings and must be interpreted within the broader communicative and situational context to arrive at a balanced understanding of the subject’s truthfulness.

The subject's lips are protruded, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, lip protrusion may suggest tension or discomfort, potentially indicating that the person is rehearsing or fabricating information. This subtle muscle movement might reflect an unconscious effort to control or mask their true emotions. However, on the other hand, such a gesture could simply be a habitual or relaxed facial expression without any connection to deceit. It might also indicate concentration or thoughtfulness as the individual processes information, rather than deception.

Similarly, the subject’s gaze directed upward carries ambiguous implications. Looking upward can sometimes be associated with attempting to retrieve memories or construct responses, which, in the context of deception, might signal that the person is inventing details or trying to maintain a false narrative. Conversely, this behavior can be an innocent reflection of genuine cognitive effort or internal visualization, as many individuals instinctively look up when recalling facts or imagining scenarios without any deceptive intent. The upward gaze might also indicate distraction or disengagement rather than evasion.

Taken together, these behaviors—lips protruded and gaze upward—do not unequivocally point to truthfulness or deception on their own. Both can be signs of internal cognitive processing or subtle stress reactions, which may be present during either honest reflection or deceptive storytelling. Without additional context, such as baseline behavior, verbal content, or surrounding circumstances, it remains challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the subject’s veracity purely based on these visible cues.

The individual’s gaze directed upward can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking upward might suggest they are engaging in cognitive effort, possibly attempting to reconstruct or fabricate information, which could be a subtle indicator of deception. It is often proposed that such eye movements accompany the mental process of creating a narrative or searching memory, which might be more pronounced if the person is not being truthful. On the other hand, an upward gaze can also simply reflect genuine memory recall or internal visualization, as people frequently look upward when accessing stored information or concentrating deeply. This behavior could therefore be a natural response to trying to retrieve accurate details rather than evidence of deceit. Without additional contextual cues, such as emotional expressions, speech patterns, or physical gestures, this behavior alone remains ambiguous. The broader context in which the gaze occurs—including the nature of the questions asked and the subject’s baseline behavior—would be essential to determine whether the upward gaze leans more toward deception or truthfulness.

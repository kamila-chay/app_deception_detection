The subject’s smile might initially convey warmth and honesty, suggesting they feel comfortable and truthful in the interaction. However, it could equally be a deliberate attempt to mask discomfort or to manipulate the interlocutor, as forced or insincere smiles are often employed to create a false sense of trust. Their raised eyebrows could signal genuine surprise or engagement, reinforcing sincerity. Conversely, such an expression might be exaggerated to feign astonishment and divert suspicion, especially when paired with other atypical behaviors.

The pronounced mouth opening and upward movement of the chin may be indicative of someone trying to emphasize their points, potentially signaling confidence and openness. Yet, these exaggerated gestures can also be interpreted as overcompensation or theatricality, which might occur when someone is fabricating or overly rehearsing their narrative. The subject’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor is typically a sign of attentiveness and honesty. Nonetheless, maintaining eye contact intentionally can be used as a tactic to persuade and conceal deceptive intent, as some individuals consciously adopt this approach to appear more credible.

Moments when the subject’s gaze shifts downward may denote reflection or modesty, which often aligns with truthful behavior. On the other hand, such downward glances are frequently associated with discomfort or attempts to avoid scrutiny, potentially revealing internal conflict or deceit. Lastly, the subtle side-turn of the head might be a natural, relaxed posture indicative of openness, but it could also signify evasiveness or a desire to create psychological distance from the dialogue. Without additional context, these behaviors could equally support interpretations of honesty or deception, highlighting the need for a broader understanding of the situation before drawing conclusions.

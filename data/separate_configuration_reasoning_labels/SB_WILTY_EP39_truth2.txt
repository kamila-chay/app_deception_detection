The individual’s raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which can be interpreted as a genuine reaction. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes be used to feign innocence or mask deceit, especially if exaggerated or inconsistent with the spoken message. Their frequent blinking could indicate nervousness or cognitive load, often associated with fabricating information. However, blinking rates can also increase due to stress, fatigue, or simply the lighting conditions in the environment, so this alone does not confirm deception. The movements of the chin, both upward and downward, might reflect shifts in confidence or defensiveness; a raised chin could be seen as an assertion of dominance or control to mask dishonesty, while a lowered chin might suggest submission or discomfort, potentially linked to deceit. Alternatively, these chin movements might just be natural postural adjustments without bearing on veracity.

Their gaze directed at the interlocutor can imply engagement and honesty, as maintaining eye contact often fosters trust. Yet, steady gaze might also be a strategic effort to appear truthful, while looking down could be interpreted as evasion or concealment. On the other hand, a downward gaze may simply reflect momentary thoughtfulness or shyness rather than deception. The head movements—forward, backward, and side-turns—could signal varying levels of openness or resistance; leaning in might indicate interest and transparency, whereas pulling back might suggest reluctance or hesitation. Still, these movements can also relate to comfort levels or physical space preference, not necessarily linked to deceit. The open posture, reflected in palms up and arms open, often conveys honesty and receptiveness, potentially supporting the perception of truthfulness. On the flip side, such openness might be deliberately used to disarm suspicion and project trustworthiness, masking underlying deceit.

In sum, the observed behaviors offer multiple plausible readings. While some gestures and expressions align with signs commonly associated with deception, they can equally be natural responses to situational factors or individual habits. Without additional contextual information or baseline behaviors, it remains challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the person’s truthfulness solely on these cues.

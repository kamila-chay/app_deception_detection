The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor could suggest engagement and honesty, as maintaining eye contact often signals openness and confidence in what is being communicated. Conversely, this gaze might also be a conscious attempt to appear truthful and mask any underlying deceit, especially if the person is intentionally trying to create a sense of trustworthiness. Their occasional gaze upward might indicate that they are accessing memories or trying to recall information, which supports the possibility of them being truthful. On the other hand, this upward glance could also reflect mental distancing or fabricating a narrative, as individuals sometimes look away to avoid direct connection when constructing falsehoods.

The side-turn of the head adds another layer of complexity. It might represent a natural shift in perspective, a way to process the conversation more thoughtfully, or an expression of empathy. Alternatively, this subtle withdrawal could be a subconscious attempt to shield oneself or momentarily disengage from the emotionally charged act of deception. The head shaking observed could equally be interpreted as a genuine expression of disagreement, doubt, or negation, reinforcing the sincerity of the subject. Yet, it might also function as a defensive or dismissive gesture aimed at deflecting scrutiny or reinforcing an untruth insincerely.

Lastly, the palms-up gesture often conveys openness, honesty, and a willingness to communicate transparently, supporting the case for truthful engagement. However, this same gesture might be employed purposely as a conciliatory signal or to persuade, potentially masking underlying uncertainty or deceptive intent. Ultimately, without additional contextual information and a broader understanding of the interaction dynamics, each of these behaviors can be reasonably interpreted to support either truthfulness or deception.

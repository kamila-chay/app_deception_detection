The individual’s frowning eyebrows might suggest discomfort or stress, which can be associated with deceptive behavior as a subconscious response to the cognitive load of fabricating information. Conversely, frowning could simply reflect concentration or confusion about the topic being discussed, rather than an intent to deceive. Their frequent blinking and exaggerated eye closing could be interpreted as signs of nervousness and an attempt to regulate anxiety that often accompanies dishonesty. However, these eye movements might also be physiological responses to environmental factors such as lighting or dry eyes, rather than indicators of deceit.

Regarding their facial expressions, the lip corners turned down and varied lip movements—such as lips protruding and retracting—could hint at the suppression of genuine emotions or discomfort in maintaining a false narrative. On the other hand, these lip behaviors might be habitual or stem from emotional states unrelated to deception, like frustration or fatigue. The gaze patterns observed, shifting between looking directly at the interlocutor, downwards, and sideways, can be viewed as potential markers of evasiveness or attempts to avoid direct confrontation when fabricating information. Yet, such gazes could equally be signs of cognitive processing, recall efforts, or cultural communication styles that naturally involve shifting eye contact.

The head movements, including tilting and side-turning, might be perceived as subtle cues indicating uncertainty or a subconscious desire to shield oneself when being deceptive. Alternatively, these movements may simply reflect engagement, interest, or a natural conversational rhythm rather than any deceptive intent. Ultimately, while these behaviors offer valuable data points, their interpretation must be carefully contextualized within the broader interaction and baseline behavior of the individual to avoid premature conclusions about truthfulness or deceit.

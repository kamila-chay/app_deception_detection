The subject raises their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the wider context. On one hand, raising eyebrows may signal surprise or disbelief, which could suggest a genuine reaction to unexpected information, supporting the idea that the person is being truthful. It might also indicate engagement or active listening, demonstrating openness and honesty during the interaction. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes be a deliberate attempt to feign surprise or innocence, potentially serving as a subtle cue to mask deceit. This expression might be used to manipulate the impression they give, introducing doubt about the veracity of their statements. Without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, the eyebrow raise alone is insufficient to conclusively determine truthfulness or deception, highlighting the importance of considering it within the broader spectrum of verbal and non-verbal communication.

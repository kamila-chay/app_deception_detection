The subject’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways; it might convey genuine warmth and openness, suggesting honesty, but it could also serve as a social mask to conceal discomfort or deflect scrutiny. The act of raising eyebrows typically signals surprise or emphasis, which might indicate sincere engagement in the conversation, yet it could equally function as an exaggerated cue intended to persuade or manipulate. Their lip corners pulling downward introduces another layer of ambiguity—this expression might reflect genuine concern or sadness, reinforcing the credibility of their emotional state, but it could also be a subtle sign of internal conflict or tension associated with deception.

The upward movement of the chin is often linked to confidence and assertiveness, potentially signaling that the subject feels comfortable and truthful in their statements. Conversely, this same gesture may be a defensive posture used to project strength and mask uncertainty when telling an untruth. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor can be interpreted as a sign of openness and honesty, fostering connection and trust, but it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible, as individuals who deceive sometimes overcompensate by holding steady eye contact.

Nodding suggests agreement and attentiveness, possibly indicating that the person is engaged and truthful; however, it may also be used to create an illusion of sincerity or to influence the listener by signaling compliance. The open palms displayed could reflect transparency and willingness to communicate honestly, yet this gesture might be consciously employed to appear non-threatening and to mitigate suspicion. Finally, arms held open may signify receptiveness and openness, reinforcing the perception of truthfulness, but they can also serve as a rehearsed pose designed to put the listener at ease while diverting attention from concealed inconsistencies.

Given the complexity of these behaviors, the broader context, including baseline behavior and conversational dynamics, must be considered to make a more reliable assessment of the subject’s truthfulness.

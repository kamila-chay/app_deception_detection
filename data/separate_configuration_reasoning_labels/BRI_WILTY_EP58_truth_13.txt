The subject’s frowning eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest discomfort or frustration, potentially signaling that they are struggling to maintain a fabricated narrative or feeling uneasy about concealing the truth. Conversely, the frown could simply reflect concentration or concern about the matter being discussed, indicating genuine engagement rather than deception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor also presents dual interpretations. Sustained eye contact may imply confidence and honesty, as the person openly faces questioning without evasiveness. However, it can equally be a deliberate strategy to assert credibility and deter suspicion, concealing deceptive intentions beneath a facade of openness. The periodic sideways glances further complicate the picture. These shifts in gaze may be viewed as signs of evasiveness or cognitive effort to construct a story, suggesting dishonesty. Yet, they might also represent attempts to recall information or process complex thoughts, which is a natural behavior unrelated to deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered within the broader context, as each could support interpretations of both truthfulness and deception depending on the individual’s baseline demeanor, situational stress, and conversational dynamics.

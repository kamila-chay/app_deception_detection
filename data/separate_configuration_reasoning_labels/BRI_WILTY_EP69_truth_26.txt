The subject’s raising of their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might suggest surprise or disbelief, which could be consistent with someone encountering unexpected questions while being truthful. Conversely, it might also signal an attempt to feign innocence or emphasize sincerity, potentially a tactic used in deception to appear more convincing. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor similarly holds dual meanings. Maintaining eye contact can be a sign of openness and honesty, reflecting confidence in what they are expressing. On the other hand, it might be deliberately prolonged or intense, serving as a strategic effort to assert credibility and dissuade suspicion, which can sometimes indicate deception. The head shaking is another behavior open to varied interpretations. It might simply convey a genuine negative response or disagreement, supporting the notion of truthful communication. Alternatively, it could function as a subtle nonverbal cue to deflect or deny information, which in some contexts may suggest the subject is withholding the truth. Each of these behaviors—raising eyebrows, sustained gaze, and head shaking—should therefore be considered within the broader interaction and additional contextual cues before drawing conclusions about the subject’s veracity.

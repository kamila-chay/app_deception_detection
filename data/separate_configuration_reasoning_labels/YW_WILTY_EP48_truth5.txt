The individual maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often suggests confidence and honesty, as the person appears willing to engage openly without avoiding scrutiny. Conversely, consistent gaze might also be a deliberate strategy to convince or persuade, masking underlying deceit through overcompensation. Their head shaking could signify disagreement or denial, indicating a potential attempt to refute questions that may reveal uncomfortable truths. Alternatively, this motion might simply reflect natural emphasis during communication, underscoring a genuine response rather than signaling dishonesty. Displaying palms up generally conveys openness and sincerity, potentially reinforcing the perception of truthfulness as it aligns with nonverbal cues associated with transparency. However, this gesture might also be consciously adopted to project honesty and disarm suspicion, thereby serving as a subtle form of manipulation. Similarly, having arms open can be seen as a welcoming and unguarded posture, indicative of comfort and veracity in the interaction. On the other hand, it might be a rehearsed way to appear relaxed and uninhibited while internally concealing deceit. Given these behaviors, it is essential to consider the broader context and congruency of verbal content with nonverbal signals before drawing conclusions about the person’s truthfulness.

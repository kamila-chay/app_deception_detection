The subject’s facial expressions, such as their frowning eyebrows, may suggest a level of discomfort or concentration, which could be interpreted as a sign of deceit given that fabricating information often requires cognitive effort. Conversely, this expression might simply reflect genuine concern or the seriousness with which they approach the conversation, indicating truthfulness. Their occasional raising of eyebrows can be viewed similarly; it might signify surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, but it could equally be a calculated gesture aimed at convincing the interlocutor or masking uncertainty. The subject’s gaze behavior further adds complexity to the interpretation. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor might be seen as a sign of honesty and engagement, fostering trust and openness. However, sustained gaze can also be a deliberate strategy to manipulate or control the interaction, potentially concealing deception. On the other hand, the sideways glances may indicate evasiveness or discomfort commonly associated with withholding information, but they could also signify the individual’s effort to mentally retrieve information or process questions thoughtfully. Ultimately, these behaviors must be understood within the broader context, as each cue holds dual possibilities, and additional information is essential to forming a more definitive assessment of truthfulness or deception.

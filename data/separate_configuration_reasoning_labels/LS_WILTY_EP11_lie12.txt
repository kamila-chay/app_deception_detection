The subject’s raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which could be interpreted as a sign of truthfulness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a subtle cue of discomfort or an unconscious reaction to stress, potentially indicating deception. Their frequent blinking may point to nervousness or cognitive overload, which can accompany deceptive behavior; however, it could equally reflect natural eye moisture regulation or a response to environmental factors such as lighting. The exaggerated closing of the eyes is particularly ambiguous—it might be a deliberate effort to conceal true emotions or to process complex information, but it might also simply be a habitual or tired expression.

Meanwhile, the downward pull of the lip corners might hint at sadness or unease, possibly arising from the strain of fabricating information. On the other hand, such a facial expression could be a genuine emotional response unrelated to deception, like discomfort or fatigue. The upward movement of the chin often conveys confidence or defiance, which might be a façade to mask dishonesty, yet it can equally signify genuine assertiveness or engagement in the conversation. Their gaze patterns—shifting between looking towards the interlocutor, downward, and sideways—present a complex picture. Direct gaze generally fosters trustworthiness, but in some cases, it may be employed consciously to appear honest. Meanwhile, looking down or sideways can indicate evasiveness or anxiety associated with deceit, though these same behaviors might simply reflect thoughtfulness or the natural process of recalling memories.

Nodding often signals agreement and can be a tactic to persuade or distract, yet it might also be an authentic expression of understanding. Finally, the slight tilting of the head can demonstrate attentiveness and openness, or it could serve as a subtle attempt to manipulate perceptions by appearing more relatable or sincere. Given these mixed signals, interpreting the subject’s behavior requires careful consideration of the broader context and additional corroborating information to draw a more confident conclusion about their truthfulness.

The individual’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest honesty and engagement, indicating that they are confident in their statements and willing to connect openly. Conversely, this same gaze could be a deliberate effort to overcompensate and appear truthful, potentially masking underlying deception. Similarly, when the person looks down, this behavior might be a sign of reflection or modesty, demonstrating thoughtfulness or discomfort with direct eye contact in a truthful exchange. However, looking away or downward could also indicate avoidance or discomfort stemming from guilt or the desire to conceal information. The slight turn of the head to the side offers yet another dual interpretation: it might denote a natural shift in attention or a genuine attempt to process the conversation from a different angle, which aligns with sincere engagement. Alternatively, the head turn could function as a defensive gesture, signaling unease or an unconscious attempt to distance themselves from the topic at hand. It is important to consider these behaviors within the broader context of the interaction, as each gesture can carry different meanings depending on the overall emotional and situational cues present.

The individual’s raised eyebrows might be interpreted in a couple of contrasting ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows can signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, suggesting they are genuinely sharing information. Conversely, this gesture could also be a subtle attempt to feign astonishment or innocence, which some people use to mislead or distract from the truth.

Their lip corners turning up could similarly be ambiguous. A slight smile often denotes friendliness and ease, which might indicate that the person is comfortable and truthful in the conversation. However, it might also be a controlled expression designed to mask discomfort or nervousness, serving as a social lubricant to deflect suspicion or appear more convincing while being deceptive.

The pattern of their gaze adds another layer of complexity. Looking directly at the interlocutor often signals engagement and confidence, which supports a truthful demeanor. Yet, some individuals consciously maintain direct eye contact to overcompensate for dishonesty, thereby making this behavior a potential red flag. Conversely, the moments when their gaze drifts downward could be interpreted as discomfort or reluctance to establish eye contact—a possible sign of deception. At the same time, looking down might simply reflect cognitive processing or emotional reflection, which occurs naturally even in truthful exchanges.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors—eyebrow raises, lip corners up, shifts in gaze—can be viewed through multiple lenses. Their interpretation is heavily dependent on the broader communicative context, individual baseline behavior, and additional cues. Without this wider framework, it remains challenging to definitively label these signals as indicators for or against deception.

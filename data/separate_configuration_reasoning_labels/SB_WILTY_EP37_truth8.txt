The individual’s smile, characterized by lip corners turning upward, can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of deception detection. On one hand, such a smile might signal genuine friendliness or comfort, suggesting openness and truthfulness in their communication. Conversely, it could be a controlled or forced expression designed to mask anxiety or to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception, potentially indicating an attempt to deceive. Their gaze behavior further complicates the interpretation. Direct eye contact towards the interlocutor often conveys confidence and sincerity, implying that the person is engaged honestly in the interaction. However, maintaining gaze could also be a strategic effort to appear credible and suppress signs of dishonesty. In contrast, moments when the individual’s gaze shifts downward might reflect internal discomfort or guilt associated with deception. Alternatively, looking down could simply indicate a natural pause to process thoughts or recall information, reflecting no deceit at all. The person’s head tilting is equally ambiguous; it may be a sign of empathy and active listening, fostering rapport and trustworthiness. Yet, it might also serve as a subtle tactic to disarm suspicion or to feign attentiveness, which could be employed effectively during deceptive exchanges. Ultimately, these visible behaviors should be assessed within the broader interactional and contextual framework before reaching a conclusion about their truthfulness or deceptiveness.

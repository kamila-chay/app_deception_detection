The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often conveys sincerity and engagement, suggesting that the person is being truthful and confident in their communication. Conversely, intense or prolonged eye contact can sometimes be employed as a tactic to overcompensate and obscure deceit, potentially indicating an attempt to mask dishonesty. When the gaze shifts upwards, this too invites dual interpretations. It might signify that the individual is thoughtfully recalling information, accessing memories to provide an accurate response. Alternatively, this upward gaze could be a signal of fabricated storytelling or mental distancing as they construct a deceptive narrative. The presence of nodding similarly holds ambiguous meaning. It can be a natural sign of agreement and active listening, reflecting genuine involvement in the conversation. Yet, it also could be used strategically to encourage trust or to persuade the interlocutor of the speaker’s authenticity, regardless of factual accuracy. Lastly, the act of head tilting can be a marker of curiosity and openness, qualities aligned with candidness and receptiveness. However, it might also represent a calculated effort to elicit empathy or disarm suspicion, which could be indicative of underlying deceit. Ultimately, understanding whether these behaviors suggest truthfulness or deception relies heavily on the broader context, including verbal cues, baseline behavior, and situational factors, making it essential to consider the full spectrum of evidence before drawing conclusions.

The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, this expression might suggest discomfort or mental effort commonly associated with fabricating or concealing information. Conversely, it could simply reflect genuine concentration or concern about the topic being discussed, without any underlying deception. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows can signal surprise or emphasis, which might indicate they are reacting spontaneously in a truthful manner. However, raised eyebrows could also be a deliberate attempt to appear more sincere or to buy time while constructing a deceptive response. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor is often perceived as a sign of engagement and honesty, as sustained eye contact can indicate confidence and openness. Yet, in some cases, a fixed gaze might be consciously maintained to mask nervousness or to project credibility, thus not necessarily ruling out deception. The occasional sideways glance adds another layer of ambiguity; it could suggest evasion or discomfort associated with dishonesty, but equally, it might reflect a natural process of recalling information or momentary distraction. Taken together, these behaviors do not definitively point to either truthfulness or deception and should be interpreted in conjunction with additional contextual cues to arrive at a more informed judgment.

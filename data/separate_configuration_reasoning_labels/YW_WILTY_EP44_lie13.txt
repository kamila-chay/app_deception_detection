The subject is raising their eyebrows, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This gesture might indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and honesty. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also signal incredulity or an effort to appear engaged, potentially masking discomfort or disbelief, which could be associated with deception. Their mouth remains closed throughout, a behavior that could reflect careful thought and composure, aligning with truthful communication. On the other hand, a closed mouth might indicate withholding information or hesitance to speak freely, raising questions about transparency.

Simultaneously, the subject displays lip corners slightly turned upward, commonly interpreted as a subtle smile. This expression might convey friendliness and genuine positive emotion, supporting a perception of truthfulness. However, such a smile can also be a controlled social cue employed to deflect suspicion or mask underlying unease, thus possibly serving as a deceptive cue. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and honesty, reflecting confidence and willingness to connect. Yet, sustained eye contact can sometimes be deliberately maintained to manipulate or convince the listener, thereby potentially indicating an intent to deceive.

Lastly, the subject tilts their head, a gesture that generally signals attentiveness and openness, reinforcing a portrayal of genuine interest and truthfulness. Alternatively, head tilting might also be a conscious or subconscious behavior aimed at softening demeanor, making the subject appear non-threatening while possibly concealing true intentions. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader context and baseline behaviors, as each cue holds the capacity to indicate both honesty and deception depending on the circumstances.

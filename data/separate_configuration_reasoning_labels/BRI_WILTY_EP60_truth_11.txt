The subject’s gaze behavior presents contrasting possibilities when interpreting their truthfulness. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor can suggest openness and engagement, characteristics often associated with honesty. Maintaining eye contact might reflect confidence and a willingness to connect, implying that the person has nothing to conceal. On the other hand, consistently looking at the interlocutor may also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and mask deception, as some individuals overcompensate by excessively stabilizing their eye contact during fabrication.

Conversely, the moments when the subject’s gaze shifts upward introduce complexity in interpreting their intent. Looking upwards is sometimes linked to cognitive processes such as accessing visual memories, which could indicate that the person is thoughtfully recalling truthful information. In this context, such gaze shifts might support the idea that they are being truthful. Alternatively, this upward gaze can also be interpreted skeptically; it may reflect the construction of imagined or fabricated details, as some studies associate upward eye movements with the creation of false memories or narratives. Therefore, these moments of looking away from the interlocutor do not straightforwardly imply deception but require more situational insight.

Taken together, the combination of direct gaze and occasional upward glances reflects an ambiguous behavioral pattern. Without additional context, it is challenging to confidently categorize these behaviors as indicators of truthfulness or deception. The gaze behavior should be considered alongside other verbal and nonverbal cues, as well as the broader situational background, to form a more accurate and nuanced assessment.

The subject’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, a smile might be a genuine expression of confidence and openness, suggesting comfort with the topic and truthfulness. Conversely, smiling might serve as a social mask intended to deflect suspicion or mask deceit, especially if it appears forced or incongruent with the verbal content. The frequent blinking observed may similarly carry dual interpretations. From one perspective, increased blinking can be a physiological response to cognitive load or anxiety, which might hint at the stress of concealing information. Alternatively, it may simply be a natural response to environmental factors such as lighting or dryness, or even a habitual behavior unrelated to veracity. The consistent gaze directed towards the interlocutor also invites ambivalent readings. Maintaining eye contact could indicate engagement, confidence, and sincerity, reinforcing the perception of truthfulness. On the other hand, sustained gaze might be a deliberate attempt to convince or control the interaction, potentially masking discomfort beneath a facade of openness. Ultimately, these behaviors alone are insufficient to conclusively determine deception without considering the broader context, including verbal cues, baseline behavior, and situational factors.

The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways; they might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, suggesting openness and engagement. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a subtle cue of skepticism or discomfort, potentially masking deceit. Their frequent blinking could indicate anxiety or stress often associated with fabricating information, yet it might simply reflect normal physiological responses such as eye dryness or heightened attentiveness during conversation. The slight upward curve at the lip corners might suggest genuine friendliness or confidence, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. Alternatively, it could be an insincere smile employed to charm or distract the interlocutor, thus casting doubt on their sincerity. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor generally conveys confidence, attentiveness, and trustworthiness; however, it can also be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate and assert credibility when attempting to deceive. Lastly, the touching of the head or body might reveal nervousness or self-soothing behavior linked to discomfort in concealing the truth, yet it could just as easily be an unconscious, habitual gesture unrelated to deception. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader context and baseline patterns to distinguish between genuine and deceptive signals.

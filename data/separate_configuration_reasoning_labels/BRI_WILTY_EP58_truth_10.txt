The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, suggesting openness in communication. Conversely, raised eyebrows could also be a subtle cue of disbelief or an effort to feign sincerity when fabricating information. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor similarly presents dual possibilities. Maintaining eye contact may indicate confidence and a genuine desire to connect, but it might also be a conscious strategy to appear trustworthy while concealing the truth.

When their gaze shifts upward, this could signify cognitive processing or attempting to retrieve accurate memories, supporting the idea of truthfulness. Alternatively, such an upward glance might be a mental escape or a sign of concocting a fabricated story. The side-turn of the head adds another layer of complexity; it might simply represent a natural moment of reflection or discomfort unrelated to deception. However, it could also suggest evasiveness or an unwillingness to fully engage, which might arise from deceptive intent.

The hands touching the head or other parts of the body further complicate interpretation. This behavior might reflect nervousness stemming from the stress of deceit, yet it could equally be an innocuous habitual gesture or a coping mechanism to manage anxiety that is unrelated to dishonesty. Ultimately, these behaviors require careful consideration within a broader context, as each has plausible explanations that support both truthful and deceptive interpretations.

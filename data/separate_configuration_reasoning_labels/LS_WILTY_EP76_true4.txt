The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing their truthfulness. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as it often indicates a willingness to engage openly and transparently. This behavior could be a sign that the individual has nothing to hide and is comfortable with the conversation. On the other hand, intentional and sustained eye contact may also be a deliberate strategy employed by someone attempting to appear trustworthy while concealing deception. In this sense, the gaze might be rehearsed or exaggerated as a means to persuade or manipulate the listener. Furthermore, cultural norms and personal traits play a crucial role—some people naturally maintain strong eye contact regardless of their veracity, while others might avoid it even when truthful. Therefore, without additional contextual cues or knowledge about the individual’s baseline behavior, the presence of gaze towards the interlocutor alone is insufficient to conclusively determine whether the person is being truthful or deceptive.

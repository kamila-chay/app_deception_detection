The subject’s exaggerated eye closing can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might suggest an attempt to control or mask emotions, which is sometimes associated with deceptive behavior as the individual tries to regulate their facial expressions consciously. On the other hand, such a gesture could simply be a habitual or involuntary reaction, perhaps due to fatigue or irritation, rather than an indicator of untruthfulness. Their chin movements, both upwards and downwards, add further complexity to the interpretation. A chin lifting upwards might signal defiance or an effort to project confidence, potentially masking discomfort linked to deception. Conversely, the downward movement could indicate submission or contemplation, which may either reflect genuine thoughtfulness or an effort to appear earnest. The subject’s gaze behavior similarly carries dual implications. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor often is taken as a sign of sincerity and engagement, yet in some cases, it can be deliberately maintained to convince or manipulate. The upward and downward glances could hint at cognitive processes involved in fabricating information or recalling memories, but they can just as well represent natural eye movements during reflection or distraction. Their head tilting and side-turning may be seen as attempts to alter perspective or distance themselves subtly from uncomfortable topics, suggestive of evasion. At the same time, these actions might simply indicate curiosity, empathy, or a relaxed conversational posture. Finally, the open arms posture could be read as an open and honest stance, promoting trustfulness, but equally, it might be a strategic display intended to appear non-threatening and cooperative. Ultimately, without additional contextual information, each of these behaviors can be reasonably interpreted as both possible signs of deception and innocuous or truthful responses, underscoring the need for a comprehensive analysis beyond isolated nonverbal cues.

The individual’s smile, characterized by the upward movement of the lip corners, can be interpreted in multiple ways in the context of truthfulness. It might signal genuine warmth and confidence, suggesting openness and honesty in their communication. Conversely, such a smile could also be a controlled social mask, deliberately employed to ease tension or mask discomfort associated with deceptive behavior. Their gaze behavior, oscillating between direct eye contact with the interlocutor and glances downward, similarly lends itself to dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact may reflect engagement, transparency, and sincerity, whereas the occasional gaze downward could signify cognitive processing, humility, or contemplation. However, it might also indicate evasiveness or an attempt to avoid detection when fabricating information. The head movements, including tilting and turning to the side, further complicate the reading of their intent. Tilting the head is often associated with empathy, interest, and openness, which are consistent with truthful engagement. On the other hand, such movements might serve as subtle attempts to deflect or mask internal discomfort related to deceit. Similarly, turning the head sideways could reflect thoughtful consideration and active listening, yet it might also be a means to avoid direct confrontation or scrutiny during deceptive exchanges. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the broader conversational and situational context to discern their true significance, as each could equally support interpretations of honesty or deception.

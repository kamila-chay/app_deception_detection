The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. This action might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially reinforcing the truthfulness of their statements. Conversely, raised eyebrows could also be a calculated signal intended to convey attentiveness or innocence, possibly masking deception. Their lip corners are turned upward, which may indicate genuine friendliness or confidence, supporting the impression of honesty. However, this expression could equally be a socially learned response or a deliberate effort to appear trustworthy, employed as a strategic means to deceive.

Regarding eye behavior, the subject alternates between gazing directly at the interlocutor and looking downward. Maintaining eye contact often suggests engagement and openness, which might signal that they have nothing to hide. On the other hand, sustained gaze can sometimes be a conscious tactic to persuade or distract, used by individuals attempting to fabricate or control a narrative. Looking downward might reflect feelings of shame or discomfort associated with dishonesty, but it could also simply indicate introspection or cognitive processing as they search for accurate information. Overall, these behaviors require careful interpretation within the wider situational and interpersonal framework to draw any reliable conclusions about their truthfulness or potential deception.

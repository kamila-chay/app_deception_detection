The subject’s lip corners are turned down, which might suggest feelings of discomfort or displeasure, potentially signaling unease associated with deceptive behavior. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect concentration or a neutral resting face without any connection to dishonesty. Their lips are retracted, a gesture that could be interpreted as an involuntary reaction to stress or tension, possibly hinting at concealed thoughts or fabricated information. Alternatively, such lip movement might be part of normal speech articulation or an unconscious facial twitch unrelated to deception.

Regarding eye movements, the subject alternates between maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor and glancing sideways. Direct eye contact is often seen as a sign of confidence and sincerity, implying truthfulness in their communication. However, sustained or intense eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit. Meanwhile, the sideways glances might suggest evasiveness or attempts to access hidden memories, potentially indicative of deception. On the other hand, side glances may also be harmless, reflecting natural cognitive processes such as recalling information or momentary distraction.

The head movements add further complexity to the interpretation. Moving the head forward could signal engagement and assertiveness, supporting the notion of straightforwardness. Yet, it might also be a subtle, unconscious attempt to test the listener’s reactions or convey dominance in a deceptive manner. Similarly, head retraction might be construed as withdrawal or discomfort that aligns with deceptive tendencies. Conversely, pulling the head back can simply be a reaction to an external stimulus, like a sudden sound, or a normal social cue reflecting thoughtfulness or hesitation unrelated to deception.

In sum, each behavior observed holds potential dual meanings. Without additional context such as verbal content, baseline behavior, or environmental factors, it remains challenging to conclusively determine the subject’s truthfulness or deceitfulness based solely on these visible cues.

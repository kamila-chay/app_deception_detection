The subject’s facial expressions and head movements present a complex picture that can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. Their frowning eyebrows might suggest discomfort or concentration, possibly indicating the cognitive effort involved in fabricating information. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect genuine concern or seriousness about the topic being discussed, without any deceptive intent. The fluctuation of lip corners—sometimes up, sometimes down—introduces further ambiguity; a slight smile might be interpreted as an attempt to appear more credible or likable, potentially masking deception, while at other moments, a downturn of the lips may reflect natural emotional responses or frustration unrelated to dishonesty.

The protrusion and retraction of the lips can also be subject to dual interpretation. Such movements may signal tension or stress, which some deception theories associate with the fear of being caught in a lie. Yet, these lip movements might as well be habitual or simply a reaction to processing questions and formulating answers. Regarding gaze behavior, maintaining direct eye contact might be seen as a sign of confidence and honesty, but equally could be a conscious strategy to convince others of their truthfulness. On the other hand, glancing sideways might reflect evasiveness or discomfort, hinting at possible deceit, though it might also indicate genuine attempts to retrieve accurate memories or momentary distractions.

The nodding behavior could be interpreted either as a sign of agreement and engagement in the conversation or as a calculated effort to reinforce credibility. Likewise, the head moving backward and side-turning could suggest defensive posture or an attempt to create psychological distance, which might be associated with deceit. Alternatively, these movements could simply represent natural shifts in posture for comfort or be indicative of contemplation during dialogue.

Ultimately, these behaviors alone do not definitively indicate truthfulness or deception. Their interpretation hinges heavily on the broader context, such as the subject’s baseline behavior, the nature of the interaction, and corroborating evidence. Hence, a cautious and comprehensive analysis is necessary before drawing conclusions.

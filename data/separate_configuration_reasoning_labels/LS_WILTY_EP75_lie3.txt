The subject exhibits frequent blinking, which in some contexts can be interpreted as a sign of cognitive overload or anxiety, potentially linked to the mental effort involved in fabricating information. Conversely, it may simply reflect physiological factors such as eye strain or dryness, or even a natural blinking rate without any connection to truthfulness. Their gaze is consistently directed toward the interlocutor, which might suggest confidence and engagement, often associated with sincerity. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy used to persuade or mask deceit, aiming to convey credibility despite underlying dishonesty. Additionally, the visible head side-turn could be a nonverbal cue of discomfort or evasiveness, possibly indicating reluctance to fully face difficult questions or concealments. On the other hand, this gesture might merely be a habitual posture or a way to process information more comfortably, without any deceptive intent. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the broader situational context, considering baseline behavior and other verbal and nonverbal indicators to form a balanced understanding of the subject’s truthfulness.

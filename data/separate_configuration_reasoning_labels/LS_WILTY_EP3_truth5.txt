The individual’s raised eyebrows combined with exaggerated eye opening may suggest an attempt to convey surprise or emphasize honesty, often used to persuade the listener of the truthfulness of their statements. Conversely, these same cues could also be interpreted as signs of feigned surprise or an effort to distract the interlocutor from inconsistencies in their story. The downward pull of the lip corners might reflect sadness or discomfort, potentially stemming from guilt or awareness of deceit; however, it could just as easily indicate genuine emotional distress unrelated to deception.

Their gaze behavior presents a complex picture: maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and sincerity, as deceptive individuals often avoid direct eye contact. Yet, some people consciously use steady gaze to mask deceit, making their gaze a deliberate tool to appear truthful. Meanwhile, looking down might reveal feelings of shame or internal conflict typically associated with dishonesty, but it could also denote reflection, embarrassment, or a natural reaction during moments of thought. The head’s sideways turn might suggest a subconscious attempt to create distance or disengage, possibly revealing discomfort linked to deception. On the other hand, it might simply be a momentary shift in attention or a way to gather thoughts in a conversation.

The open position of the arms generally communicates openness and receptivity, which aligns with truthful behavior as it signals a lack of defensive barriers. However, in certain contexts, open arms can be a strategic posture designed to project sincerity and friendliness, thereby diverting suspicion. Overall, each of these behaviors can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the wider context, individual differences, and the specifics of the interaction. Without additional information, these signals alone do not conclusively confirm or refute the presence of deception.

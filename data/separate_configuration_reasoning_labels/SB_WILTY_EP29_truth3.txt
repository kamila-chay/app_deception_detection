The subject’s laughter and visibly lifted lip corners might initially be interpreted as signs of genuine amusement or comfort, suggesting honesty and openness in the interaction. However, it is also possible that these behaviors serve as a social mask intended to deflect suspicion or mask underlying discomfort, which could indicate deceptive intent. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen as a demonstration of confidence and sincerity, reflecting a commitment to truthful communication. Conversely, it might also be a deliberate tactic to control the interaction or create an illusion of transparency, which some deceivers employ to appear more credible. Similarly, the head tilting could convey engagement and interest, reinforcing the impression of genuine involvement and attentiveness. On the other hand, this gesture might be consciously used to soften their appearance and reduce perceived threat, an effort that might accompany deceptive behavior. Ultimately, while these behaviors could signal either honesty or deception, interpreting them accurately requires careful consideration of the broader context in which they occur.

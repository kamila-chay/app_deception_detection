The person’s frowning eyebrows could suggest a moment of discomfort or frustration, which in some contexts might indicate the mental effort involved in fabricating information or concealing the truth. Conversely, this same expression could simply reflect genuine confusion, concentration, or emotional distress unrelated to deceit, such as reacting to a difficult question or recalling complex details. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor might be interpreted as an attempt to maintain control over the interaction, possibly to monitor the other’s reactions carefully while constructing a deceptive narrative. Alternatively, sustained eye contact can also be a sign of honesty and engagement, demonstrating openness and a willingness to communicate transparently. The head shaking could be understood as a non-verbal denial or resistance often associated with deceptive behavior, perhaps signaling an unconscious effort to reject uncomfortable truths. Yet, it might equally be a natural gesture of emphasis or disagreement that corresponds with their truthful state, indicating sincere refusal or disbelief regarding the topic discussed. Ultimately, without additional contextual information, these behaviors offer ambiguous cues that can be reasonably interpreted as either markers of deception or indicators of genuine emotional and cognitive responses.

The individual’s smile, characterized by lip corners turned upward and lips retracted while maintaining a closed mouth, could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this controlled smile might suggest genuine positive engagement or comfort in the interaction, signaling honesty and openness. Conversely, such a smile could also be a deliberate attempt to mask true feelings or create a favorable impression, hinting at possible deception. Their gaze behavior further complicates interpretation: looking directly at the interlocutor typically conveys attentiveness and sincerity, yet occasional sideways glances might indicate discomfort or evasiveness, potentially reflecting an effort to fabricate information. However, sideward glances may also simply reflect normal cognitive processing or momentary distraction, not necessarily dishonesty. The subtle head turn to the side might suggest an openness and willingness to engage, as supported by their open-arm posture, which can be seen as a nonverbal cue of transparency. Alternatively, it might function as a self-soothing gesture or a tactic to deflect scrutiny, hinting at concealed information. Without additional context or baseline behavior to compare against, these nuanced signals remain ambiguous, and both truthfulness and deception remain plausible interpretations.

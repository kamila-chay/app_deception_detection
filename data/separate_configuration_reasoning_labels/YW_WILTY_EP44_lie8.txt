The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, this gesture might reflect surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, signaling sincerity in their communication. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate effort to appear more engaged or convincing while fabricating information. Frequent blinking may indicate cognitive load or stress associated with deception, as the individual attempts to manage the complexity of a fabricated narrative. However, blinking rates can also fluctuate naturally due to nervousness, environmental factors, or simply as part of their normal expressiveness, without any deceptive intent. The subtle lifting of the lip corners could be seen as a genuine smile, suggesting positive emotional alignment and trustworthiness. On the other hand, this expression might be a controlled social smile aimed at masking discomfort or deflecting suspicion. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor is often perceived as a signal of confidence and truthfulness, yet it could equally be a strategic choice to project honesty and maintain control during a deceptive interaction. Lastly, the head tilting may convey empathy and active listening, implying openness and honesty, or it might be used as a calculated tactic to appear more relatable and disarming. Without broader contextual information, each of these behaviors can support opposite interpretations, underscoring the importance of integrating additional cues and situational details to draw a more reliable conclusion about the subject’s truthfulness.

The subject’s lips are protruded, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This behavior might suggest a subtle attempt to maintain control over what they are saying, possibly signaling tension or discomfort often associated with concealing information. Alternatively, it could simply be a habitual or unconscious facial expression without any connection to deception, reflecting concentration or thoughtfulness. Similarly, their gaze directed upwards carries ambiguous implications. On one hand, looking up may indicate cognitive effort—perhaps the individual is fabricating details or carefully constructing a narrative rather than recalling genuine memories. On the other hand, this upward gaze might be a natural response when trying to retrieve information from memory or process complex ideas, which could suggest honesty and genuine reflection. Given these behaviors in isolation, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether the subject is being truthful or deceptive; a more comprehensive understanding of their baseline behavior and the broader conversational context would be necessary for a more accurate assessment.

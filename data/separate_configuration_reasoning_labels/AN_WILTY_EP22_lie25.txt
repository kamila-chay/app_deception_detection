The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often signals confidence and honesty, as it suggests openness and a willingness to engage transparently. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate effort to appear credible and mask any underlying deceit, as some deceivers overcompensate by maintaining excessive eye contact to avoid suspicion.

Their head tilting might similarly carry dual meanings. Tilting the head can convey curiosity and active listening, which supports the notion of genuine engagement and truthfulness. Yet, it might also be used strategically to project a non-threatening demeanor or to momentarily distract the interlocutor from inconsistencies, potentially hinting at deceptive intent.

The posture of having the head held up can be a sign of confidence and assertiveness, often associated with sincerity and control over the narrative being presented. On the other hand, this elevated head position could be employed to assert dominance or to mask internal discomfort tied to dishonesty, creating a facade of certainty despite underlying uncertainty.

Finally, the openness of the arms can be perceived as a display of transparency and receptiveness, aligning with truthful communication and emotional accessibility. However, open arms might also be consciously adopted to reduce defensive signals and engender trust, serving as a tactical cue rather than an authentic expression of openness.

Overall, each of these behaviors possesses plausible interpretations on both sides of the truthfulness spectrum. To form a more accurate assessment, these cues should be considered within the broader context of situational factors, baseline behaviors, and accompanying verbal and nonverbal signals.

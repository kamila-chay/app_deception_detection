The individual’s raised eyebrows may signal surprise or emphasis, which can be consistent with genuine reactions during communication. However, raised eyebrows might also be employed deliberately to feign astonishment or to manipulate the listener’s perception, potentially indicating deceptive intent. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor suggests engagement and confidence, traits often associated with truthful interactions. Conversely, sustained eye contact can sometimes be a conscious effort to mask deceit, as deceivers may overcompensate by maintaining strong visual connection to appear credible. The nodding behavior could be interpreted as active listening and agreement, reinforcing the sense that the person is being honest and cooperative. On the other hand, nodding might be strategically used to encourage the interlocutor or to deflect attention, which could align with deceptive tactics. Ultimately, these behaviors are open to multiple interpretations and should be assessed within the broader context, taking into account additional verbal and nonverbal cues to form a more accurate judgment.

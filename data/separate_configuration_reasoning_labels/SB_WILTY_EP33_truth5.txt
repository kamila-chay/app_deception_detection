The individual’s raised eyebrows may be interpreted in contrasting ways depending on the context. On one hand, this gesture could signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which aligns with truthful communication. Conversely, raised eyebrows might serve as a subtle attempt to manipulate or feign innocence, possibly indicating deceptive intent if paired with other suspicious cues. Their upward gaze similarly presents a dual interpretation; it may reflect genuine cognitive processing, such as trying to recall accurate information, which supports credibility. Alternatively, looking upwards can sometimes be a strategic move to avoid direct eye contact or to fabricate details, hinting at potential dishonesty. The head tilting equally warrants careful consideration: it might express openness, engagement, or curiosity, all of which can be associated with earnestness in conversation. Yet, the same gesture might also function as a means to deflect or soften a response, potentially masking discomfort or evasion. Without additional context, these behaviors alone do not definitively signal truthfulness or deception, underscoring the need for a holistic assessment of verbal and non-verbal cues together.

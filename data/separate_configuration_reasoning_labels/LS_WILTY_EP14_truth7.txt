The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, such expressions might suggest genuine positive emotion or confidence in their statements, reinforcing the credibility of their account. Conversely, the smile and lip movement could also serve as a social mask or a strategic attempt to appear more trustworthy, potentially masking underlying deceit. Their downward gaze further complicates the interpretation. Avoiding direct eye contact often raises suspicion as it can be a sign of discomfort or evasion, which might indicate deceptive behavior. However, looking down might equally reflect introspection, modesty, or the cognitive effort involved in recalling truthful information, rather than an intent to mislead. Similarly, the subtle turn of their head to the side can be seen as a defensive posture, possibly signaling a desire to shield themselves from scrutiny or to distance themselves from the topic at hand, which might hint at dishonesty. In contrast, that same movement might simply denote natural body language, a moment of thoughtfulness, or a nonverbal cue reflecting their personal communication style. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues or a broader understanding of the situation, these behaviors alone cannot conclusively indicate whether the person is being truthful or deceptive.

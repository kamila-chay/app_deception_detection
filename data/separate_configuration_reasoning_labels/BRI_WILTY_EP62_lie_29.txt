The individual’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest discomfort or tension, which some might associate with the cognitive strain or emotional unease involved in deception. Conversely, frowning could simply reflect genuine confusion, concentration, or concern about the topic being discussed, without any intent to deceive. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor also presents dual possibilities. Maintaining eye contact might indicate honesty and openness, signaling engagement and a willingness to communicate transparently. However, it could also be a deliberate effort to establish credibility and mask deceptive intent, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to appear truthful. When the person’s gaze shifts upwards, this behavior similarly carries ambiguous meanings. Looking upward is sometimes linked to constructing a fabricated narrative or recalling imagined details, which could hint at deceit. Alternatively, upward gaze might simply reflect an attempt to retrieve genuine memories or thoughtful consideration, especially when the subject is pondering a complex question. Given these contrasting interpretations, understanding the broader context of the interaction and considering additional verbal and nonverbal cues would be essential for forming a more accurate assessment of their truthfulness.

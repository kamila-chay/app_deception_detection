The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. Maintaining eye contact might suggest openness and honesty, as they appear engaged and willing to connect. Conversely, sustained gaze could also be a deliberate attempt to overcompensate for deceit, using eye contact to feign credibility and distract from underlying falsehoods. Their open arms might similarly convey transparency and a relaxed demeanor, signaling a lack of defensive barriers and thus supporting authenticity. However, this same posture could be an intentional display designed to create an impression of vulnerability or sincerity, masking discomfort or uncertainty beneath the surface. The shrug, often associated with uncertainty or lack of knowledge, might genuinely reflect a candid admission of not knowing or being unsure. Alternatively, it could be employed strategically as a nonverbal deflection, subtly avoiding commitment to details or attempting to minimize responsibility. Each of these behaviors, while providing potential clues, must be carefully weighed against the broader context and other observational cues to more accurately assess the veracity of the individual’s statements.

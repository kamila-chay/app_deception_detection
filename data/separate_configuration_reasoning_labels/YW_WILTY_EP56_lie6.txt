The individual is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows may serve as a subtle indication of surprise or uncertainty, potentially reflecting an attempt to mask discomfort or fabricate details. From this viewpoint, the gesture might be part of an effort to appear more convincing by displaying a controlled emotional response. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also simply signify genuine engagement or curiosity in the conversation, reflecting openness and attentiveness rather than deceit. Without additional context, it is equally plausible that this expression is a natural and spontaneous reaction rather than a deliberate cue.

Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor similarly offers grounds for both interpretations. Maintaining eye contact can be seen as a sign of sincerity and confidence, suggesting that the person is forthcoming and truthful. Such direct gaze often serves to establish rapport and indicates a willingness to be transparent. However, persistent gaze might also be a strategic behavior intended to convince the listener of the speaker's credibility, masking possible deception through exaggerated attentiveness. Alternatively, it could stem from nervousness or an effort to carefully monitor the listener’s reactions during the delivery of a fabricated story. Therefore, while the gaze toward the interlocutor might hint at honesty, it is equally plausible that it represents an intentional tactic to influence perception.

Ultimately, given these behaviors—raising eyebrows and directed gaze—both truthful and deceptive explanations hold merit, and discerning the true intent would require examining these cues alongside the broader context of the interaction.

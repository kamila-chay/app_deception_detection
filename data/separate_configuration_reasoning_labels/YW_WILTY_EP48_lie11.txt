The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, such expressions might suggest genuine friendliness and openness, indicating they are comfortable and truthful in the interaction. However, smiles can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to create a false sense of trust, which might hint at deceptive intentions. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows and tilting the head upward can be signs of attentiveness or interest, reflecting sincerity and engagement with the interlocutor. Conversely, these same gestures may be used to feign innocence or surprise, potentially serving as a subtle attempt to manipulate the listener’s perception.

Their gaze behavior, alternating between direct eye contact with the interlocutor and looking sideways, further complicates the interpretation. Consistent eye contact is often associated with honesty and confidence, suggesting transparency. Yet, overly intense or prolonged eye contact might be consciously maintained to project truthfulness, which could indicate deceit. On the other hand, frequent glances to the side might signal evasiveness or an effort to construct a fabricated narrative. Alternatively, such sideways looks could simply reflect natural cognitive processes, such as trying to recall specific information or momentarily being distracted, without implicating deception.

The upward movement of the chin and the head posture also contribute to this ambiguous picture. Holding the head up can convey confidence and self-assuredness, traits commonly linked to truthful communication. However, it could equally represent a defensive stance or an attempt to assert dominance, which might be employed to obscure dishonest behavior. Head tilting, often interpreted as a sign of empathy or thoughtfulness, might reinforce the impression of sincerity. Yet, it can also be a deliberate tactic to appear more relatable or to soften the impact of potentially dubious statements.

Overall, while these behaviors provide valuable cues, they do not offer definitive proof of truthfulness or deception in isolation. The context of the interaction, baseline behaviors of the individual, and additional verbal and non-verbal signals are essential to forming a more reliable assessment.

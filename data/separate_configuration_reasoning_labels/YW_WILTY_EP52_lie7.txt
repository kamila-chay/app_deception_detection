The person’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, raised eyebrows may signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, suggesting that the individual is truthful and engaged in the conversation. On the other hand, this same gesture might also be a deliberate attempt to feign sincerity or mask discomfort, often employed unconsciously by someone trying to appear convincing when being deceptive. Meanwhile, their direct gaze toward the interlocutor can similarly be seen through contrasting lenses. Maintaining eye contact is frequently associated with confidence and honesty, implying the person is transparent and forthcoming. Conversely, sustained gaze can also be a strategic effort to control the interaction and deflect suspicion, as deceptive individuals sometimes overcompensate by locking eyes to appear credible. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors relies heavily on the broader situational context and accompanying verbal or nonverbal cues, as each could just as easily indicate truthfulness as it could suggest deception.

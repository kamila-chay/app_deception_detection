The subject’s head tilting can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. On one hand, this gesture might suggest an attempt to appear more engaging or empathetic, which could be a strategy to build trust and mask deceptive intentions. Alternatively, head tilting can also simply reflect genuine curiosity, attentiveness, or thoughtfulness—natural responses during interaction that do not necessarily imply deceit. Similarly, the person’s hands touching their head or body might be seen as a sign of nervousness, possibly indicating discomfort or anxiety associated with fabricating information. However, such self-touching behaviors are also common self-soothing gestures employed in moments of stress unrelated to deception, such as normal social unease or habit. Without additional contextual cues, these behaviors alone are ambiguous; they could either point to a conscious effort to deceive or merely represent typical, harmless expressions of human communication.

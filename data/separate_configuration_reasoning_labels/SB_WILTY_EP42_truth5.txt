The subject’s frequent blinking could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might suggest cognitive stress or anxiety commonly associated with deception, as the effort to fabricate information often elevates arousal and leads to increased blinking. On the other hand, frequent blinking may simply be a physiological response to environmental factors such as dry eyes or lighting conditions, or a natural baseline behavior unrelated to deceit. Their mouth remaining closed throughout may indicate discomfort or an attempt to withhold information, which some might view as a sign of evasion. Conversely, a closed mouth could also reflect composure or a deliberate decision to listen attentively rather than speak, which does not necessarily imply dishonesty.

The subtle movements of the chin both upwards and downwards present another ambiguous cue. Chin lifting could be seen as a defensive posture, possibly signaling an effort to assert control or mask insecurity, traits sometimes linked with deception. Yet, it could equally be a habitual or reflexive movement without deeper psychological meaning. Similarly, lowering the chin might reflect submissiveness or apprehension, which may either stem from anxiety related to deceit or simply from feeling uncertain in a high-pressure conversation. The subject’s gaze behavior is equally complex: direct eye contact with the interlocutor might convey confidence and sincerity, supporting the idea that they are truthful. However, intentional eye contact can also be a conscious strategy to appear honest and convince others, potentially masking deceit. When the gaze shifts downward or sideways, it might suggest evasiveness or discomfort with direct scrutiny, often associated with deceptive behavior. Yet, such gaze aversions could also indicate thoughtfulness or attempts to recall specific information, reflecting cognitive engagement rather than deceit.

Lastly, the subtle side-turn of the head is open to interpretation as well. Turning the head away might be perceived as a desire to distance oneself from the discussion or conceal true feelings, behaviors that sometimes accompany dishonesty. Alternatively, it could simply be a natural movement made for comfort or due to social cues in the interaction, not inherently linked to deception. Ultimately, each of these behaviors—while potentially indicative of deception—can just as plausibly be explained by benign or unrelated factors. A more accurate assessment would require additional contextual information, including baseline behavior, verbal cues, and situational dynamics.

The subject’s raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or uncertainty, which could be interpreted as an attempt to mask discomfort or hesitation commonly associated with deception. Alternatively, raised eyebrows can simply denote attentiveness or genuine interest, indicating engagement rather than concealment. Their gaze directed sideways may be seen as a sign of evasion or discomfort, potentially reflecting an effort to avoid direct eye contact to hide deceit. Conversely, sideways glances could equally reflect cognitive processing as the individual recalls information or contemplates their response, rather than deliberate avoidance. The open position of their arms might convey openness and honesty, signaling a willingness to communicate transparently. However, it could also be a strategic posture meant to appear more trustworthy and disarming, possibly concealing underlying nervousness or defensiveness. Ultimately, these behaviors each hold dual potential meanings, and interpreting them requires careful consideration of the broader situational and contextual factors before drawing conclusions about the subject’s veracity.

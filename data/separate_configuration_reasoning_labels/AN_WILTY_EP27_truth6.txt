The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This could suggest surprise or emphasize a point, which might indicate sincerity and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, eyebrow raising can also be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or exaggerate emotion, potentially serving as a deceptive tactic. Their chin moving downwards adds another layer of complexity; this movement might reflect genuine introspection or humility, signaling openness and truthfulness. Alternatively, it could be a subtle sign of discomfort or an effort to shield oneself, which sometimes accompanies deceptive behavior. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor is often seen as a sign of confidence and honesty, indicating that the person is willing to engage openly. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to convince or manipulate, especially if it seems forced or unusually intense. Finally, the occasional gaze upward can be associated with cognitive effort, such as trying to recall details accurately, supporting the idea of truthfulness. Yet, this same upward gaze might also correspond to fabricated thinking or mental construction of a narrative, behaviors commonly linked with deception. Without additional contextual information, these behaviors alone offer ambiguous signals, and care must be taken not to overinterpret them as definitive proof of truthfulness or deception.

The individual maintains gaze towards their interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of truthfulness or deception. On one hand, steady eye contact is often associated with honesty and confidence, suggesting they have nothing to hide and are engaging openly in the conversation. Conversely, sustained gaze can also be a deliberate strategy used by someone attempting to convince or manipulate, as they may overcompensate with eye contact to appear sincere. Meanwhile, their occasional sideways glances introduce another layer of ambiguity. These glances might indicate cognitive effort or discomfort, potentially signaling that they are fabricating information or feeling uneasy about their statements. Alternatively, such lateral eye movements could simply reflect moments of reflection or attempts to recall specific details, which are common in truthful recall. Ultimately, these behaviors alone are insufficient to definitively determine deception or truthfulness; comprehensive assessment within the larger situational and contextual framework is necessary to draw more accurate conclusions.

The subject’s gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing downward, can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Direct eye contact often conveys confidence and engagement, suggesting that the person is being open and truthful. However, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere and thus mask deceptive intentions. Conversely, looking downward is commonly associated with evasiveness or discomfort, potentially indicating that the individual is withholding information or feeling guilty about a fabrication. Yet, this same behavior might simply reflect natural shyness, cultural norms around eye contact, or the cognitive effort of recalling information. Without additional context, such as verbal content, baseline behavior, or environmental factors, it remains equally plausible that these gaze patterns signify honesty or deception, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive evaluation rather than reliance on isolated behaviors.

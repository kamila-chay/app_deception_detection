The individual’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might suggest genuine positive emotion, which could indicate honesty and comfort in the interaction. Conversely, these same expressions could be deliberately controlled or insincere, potentially serving as a mask to conceal deceit. The presence of both lip corners moving downwards alongside the smile adds complexity; it may represent mixed genuine emotions such as uncertainty or regret, or alternatively, it might signal internal conflict often associated with deceptive behavior. The chin moving upwards can be interpreted as a sign of confidence or assertiveness, lending credibility to their statements. However, it might also be a subtle attempt to assert dominance or conceal insecurity, which can sometimes accompany deception.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor typically signals engagement and openness, which supports the possibility of truthful communication. Yet, occasional sideways glances could reflect cognitive effort related to fabricating information or discomfort with the topic at hand. On the other hand, these side glances might simply mark moments of memory recall or natural shifts in attention during conversation. Head tilting and turning can be seen as signs of interest and empathy, fostering a sense of connection that often suggests transparency. Alternatively, these movements might be strategic behaviors intended to appear more relatable or to distract from incongruities in speech. Finally, the presence of shrugging could indicate uncertainty or an admission of not knowing, which might be consistent with honesty. Conversely, it might reflect evasiveness or an attempt to avoid giving a direct answer, which can be associated with deceptive behavior.

Given the nuanced nature of these behaviors, each could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context of the interaction, making it essential to consider additional cues and situational factors before drawing conclusions about truthfulness or deception.

The person’s sustained gaze towards their interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest honesty and confidence, indicating that they have nothing to hide and are fully engaged in the conversation. This direct gaze could reflect transparency and a genuine desire to connect, which are often associated with truthful communication. On the other hand, prolonged eye contact might also be a deliberate strategy employed to mask deceit, used to create an illusion of openness and control. In some cases, individuals who are fabricating information may overcompensate by staring intently to persuade their listener or to avoid suspicion. Ultimately, the meaning of this gaze depends heavily on the broader context, including the person’s baseline behavior and the nature of the interaction. Without additional cues or background information, the same behavior could equally support interpretations of honesty or deception.

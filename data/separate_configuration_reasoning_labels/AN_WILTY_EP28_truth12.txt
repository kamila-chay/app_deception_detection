The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest confidence and openness, often associated with truthful communication. It can convey engagement and a willingness to be transparent. On the other hand, deliberate eye contact can also be a tactic used to assert control or to overcompensate for deceptive intent, aiming to appear sincere while masking discomfort or dishonesty. 

Conversely, the moments when their gaze shifts sideways introduce further ambiguity. Sideways glances may indicate cognitive effort, as the person attempts to access memories or formulate responses, which aligns with truthful behavior during challenging recollection. Alternatively, such gaze aversions might signal evasiveness, distraction, or a desire to avoid direct confrontation, potential markers of deception. These subtle eye movements alone cannot conclusively reveal intent without considering the broader situational context.

Ultimately, the combination of direct and sideways eye contact presents a complex behavioral picture. Each cue can support both honesty and concealment narratives depending on accompanying verbal and nonverbal signals. Careful evaluation of the overall interaction and situational factors is essential before drawing firm conclusions about the individual’s veracity.

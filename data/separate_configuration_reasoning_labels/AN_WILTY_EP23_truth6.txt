The subject’s tendency to gaze downwards can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on the broader context and individual baseline behaviors. On one hand, looking down might suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which some theories link to deception as the person could be experiencing guilt or trying to shield themselves from scrutiny. This avoidance could be a subconscious effort to hide their true feelings or fabricate information. On the other hand, downward gaze is not inherently indicative of untruthfulness; it might simply reflect introspection, concentration, or the natural process of searching memory. Some individuals look down when thinking deeply or organizing their thoughts, making this behavior a potential marker of honesty rather than deceit. Ultimately, without additional cues or situational information, the act of gazing down remains ambiguous, serving as just one piece in the complex puzzle of accurately assessing truthfulness.

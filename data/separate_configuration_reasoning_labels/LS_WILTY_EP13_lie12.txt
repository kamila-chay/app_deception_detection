The subject’s raised eyebrows may signal surprise or skepticism, which could suggest they are reacting defensively to a challenging question, potentially indicating deception. Conversely, this facial expression might simply reflect genuine curiosity or engagement in the conversation, revealing nothing about their truthfulness. Their protruded lips and upward movement of the chin might be interpreted as subtle signs of discomfort or defiance, possibly hinting at an internal attempt to mask dishonesty. However, these same gestures could also stem from momentary concentration or habit, unrelated to any deceptive intent.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor is often seen as a cue of transparency and confidence, supporting the idea that the subject is being truthful. Yet, sustained eye contact can sometimes be strategically employed to feign sincerity and mask deceit, especially if it feels overly deliberate or unnatural. The observed head shaking and raised head posture might be read as dismissive or resistant, potentially indicative of evasion or denial in the context of dishonesty. Alternatively, these movements could simply reflect the person's natural way of emphasizing their statements or conveying disagreement without any deceptive motives.

The subject’s hands touching their head or body might reveal signs of nervousness or self-soothing behavior, which some researchers associate with the emotional discomfort of lying. On the other hand, such gestures could be habitual or arise from casual adjustment without any link to deception. Their open arms posture may suggest openness and honesty, but it can also be a conscious or subconscious attempt to appear non-threatening and trustworthy while concealing deception. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors depends greatly on the broader context and baseline behaviors, necessitating careful consideration before drawing conclusions about their veracity.

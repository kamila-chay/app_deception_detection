The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can often be interpreted as a sign of engagement and honesty, suggesting they are open and confident in the conversation. Such direct eye contact may indicate that the person is comfortable sharing information and is not attempting to hide anything. Conversely, this same behavior might be consciously employed to create an impression of sincerity, potentially masking deceit behind a façade of attentiveness. The deliberate effort to maintain eye contact can sometimes be a strategy to convince others of the truthfulness of their statements.

Simultaneously, the person exhibits sideways glances. These moments could signify discomfort or evasiveness, potentially pointing to attempts to evade direct questioning or to mentally distance themselves from the topic, which might hint at deceptive intentions. Alternatively, sideways glances may simply reflect natural cognitive processing, such as searching for memories or organizing thoughts, and could be unrelated to any dishonesty. They might also indicate momentary distraction or social anxiety rather than purposeful deceit.

Given these contrasting interpretations, the behaviors observed—both the steady gaze and the sideways looks—require careful consideration of the broader conversational context, including verbal cues and environmental factors, to make a more grounded assessment of potential deception.

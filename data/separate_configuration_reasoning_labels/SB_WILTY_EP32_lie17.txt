The person’s exaggerated mouth opening can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might suggest an intentional effort to emphasize sincerity or highlight a particular point, which could be an attempt to persuade or convince the listener genuinely. Conversely, such an exaggerated expression might be a sign of discomfort or an unconscious effort to distract or mask the truth, potentially indicating deception. Their gaze behavior further complicates the interpretation. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor often signals engagement and honesty, as direct eye contact tends to be associated with openness. However, in some cases, individuals might deliberately sustain eye contact to appear truthful while crafting a deceptive narrative. The occasional upward gaze might imply cognitive effort linked to recalling truthful memories, but it could equally reflect the creation of fabricated information. Similarly, sideward gazes might be read as signs of evasiveness or discomfort typical in deceptive behavior, yet they can also be moments of natural distraction or reflective thought when trying to accurately recount events. The head turning to the side adds another layer of complexity; it might indicate avoidance or discomfort associated with deception, or it could simply be a gesture related to thinking or processing information more thoroughly. Ultimately, each of these behaviors holds dual implications, and without additional context, it is challenging to definitively interpret them as indicators of truthfulness or deception.

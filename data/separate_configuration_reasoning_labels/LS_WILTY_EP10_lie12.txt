The subject’s gaze behavior alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing downward. Direct eye contact can be interpreted as a sign of honesty and engagement, suggesting openness and confidence in their statements. Conversely, prolonged or intense eye contact might also be a deliberate attempt to appear credible and mask deceptive intent. Similarly, the downward gaze could reflect moments of reflection or modesty, supporting the sincerity of their recollections, but it might also indicate discomfort or an effort to avoid scrutiny when fabricating information.

Their nodding conveys a level of agreement and attentiveness, which often aligns with honest communication and receptiveness to the dialogue. However, nodding can also be a strategic behavior meant to build rapport or sway the interlocutor, potentially serving as a tool to enhance persuasiveness irrespective of truthfulness. Movements of the head, both forward and backward, add further complexity. Leaning forward generally signals interest and engagement, which complements honest intent, yet in other contexts, it might be a tactic to appear earnest or to pressure the listener. Pulling the head backward could show hesitation or discomfort, hinting at possible deception, though it might also simply be a natural response to processing information or managing personal space.

The subject’s open arm posture suggests a welcoming and transparent stance, often associated with sincerity and confidence in sharing information. On the other hand, open arms can occasionally be used to project openness artificially and can mask underlying tension or guardedness. Ultimately, these behaviors require careful consideration within the broader interpersonal and situational context to more accurately discern whether they stem from genuine truthfulness or are indicative of deception.

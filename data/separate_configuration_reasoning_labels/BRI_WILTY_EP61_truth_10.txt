The subject’s frowning eyebrows may suggest concentration or concern, which in some cases could be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or internal conflict often associated with deception. However, this expression might also simply reflect genuine confusion or sincere effort to understand or recall information, indicating honesty rather than deceit. Their palms being held up can be seen as an open and submissive gesture, potentially signaling a willingness to be truthful and transparent. Conversely, this same gesture might be employed manipulatively to feign openness and disarm suspicion when someone is attempting to deceive. The shrug further complicates interpretation; it could imply uncertainty or lack of knowledge, consistent with truthful admission of ignorance. Yet, a shrug might also function as a defensive or evasive maneuver designed to avoid providing specific details when fabricating a response. Without additional context, such as the subject’s baseline behavior, verbal content, and situational cues, these visible behaviors alone offer ambiguous evidence that could support either truthful or deceptive intent.

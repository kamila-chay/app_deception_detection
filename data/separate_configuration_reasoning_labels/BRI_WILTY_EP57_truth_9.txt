The subject’s gaze behavior presents a nuanced picture that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest openness and confidence, characteristics often associated with honesty. Maintaining eye contact can convey engagement and sincerity, indicating that the person feels comfortable and truthful in the interaction. Conversely, it is also possible that the individual is consciously maintaining eye contact to appear credible and mask any deceit, as some people deliberately use steady gaze as a tactic to project trustworthiness.

The moments when the subject’s gaze shifts upward add another layer of complexity. Looking up is sometimes linked to the cognitive effort of constructing or searching for information, which could imply that the individual is fabricating or piecing together details. However, this same upward glance can also occur when someone is genuinely trying to recall past events or retrieve memories, indicating that the person may be thoughtfully accessing truthful information rather than inventing it.

Similarly, the occasional sideways gaze warrants cautious consideration. On one hand, looking sideways might signal discomfort or evasion, potentially reflecting an internal conflict or an attempt to avoid full disclosure. This behavior could be interpreted as a subtle indicator of deception. On the other hand, sideways glances can simply be a natural part of normal social interaction, reflecting momentary distraction or processing of the environment without any deceptive intent.

Ultimately, these gaze patterns need to be evaluated within the broader context of the interaction, including verbal cues, baseline behaviors, and situational factors. Each behavior can be interpreted as either a sign of truthfulness or a marker of deception, underscoring the importance of comprehensive analysis before drawing conclusions.

The subject's raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating they are genuinely engaged and honest in the interaction. Conversely, this same gesture could be a deliberate attempt to feign openness or innocence, masking underlying deceit. Their lip corners turning up suggest a smile that could reflect warmth and sincerity, yet it could equally serve as a social mask, crafted to disarm the interlocutor and deflect suspicion. The downward movement of the chin may indicate submission or thoughtfulness, possibly showing honest reflection or uncertainty; alternatively, it could be a subtle attempt to avoid direct confrontation or hide discomfort associated with deception.

Their gaze behavior is particularly nuanced. Looking towards the interlocutor generally signals engagement and willingness to communicate truthfully, fostering connection. However, frequent gaze downward might imply discomfort or evasion, traits often associated with deceptive behavior. On the other hand, depending on cultural or personal factors, gaze aversion may simply be a sign of contemplation or respect, not necessarily dishonesty. The open positioning of their palms is traditionally seen as a gesture of openness and transparency, potentially underscoring genuineness. Yet, this can also be consciously employed as a strategic display to create an illusion of honesty.

Similarly, having arms open can indicate receptiveness and ease in the conversation, hinting at truthful intent. Conversely, it might be a rehearsed posture designed to project confidence and control, masking internal unease. Ultimately, these behaviors must be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction and baseline behavior of the individual to draw more reliable conclusions about their truthfulness or deception.

The individual’s frowning eyebrows might be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, the furrowed brow could suggest cognitive effort or discomfort, which are sometimes associated with fabricating information or concealing the truth. This expression might indicate that the person is experiencing internal conflict or stress related to dishonesty. Conversely, frowning can also arise from genuine concentration or confusion, especially if the topic is complex or emotionally charged. In such cases, the furrowed brows would reflect sincere engagement or difficulty processing information rather than deceit.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor presents another dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact can be viewed as an attempt to establish trust and appear sincere, potentially supporting the notion that the individual is being truthful. Steady eye contact might be a conscious effort to convey honesty or transparency. However, direct gaze can also be a deliberate strategy employed by someone who is deceptive, as it might serve to mask nervousness or manipulate the perception of credibility. Alternatively, consistent eye contact may simply reflect cultural norms or the person’s comfort in the interaction, devoid of any intention to deceive.

In summary, both the frowning eyebrows and the focused gaze hold ambiguous meanings that can support interpretations of truthfulness or deception depending on the broader context, including the individual’s baseline behavior, the situation’s emotional weight, and other verbal and non-verbal cues. Without additional information, these behaviors alone do not definitively indicate whether the person is being truthful or deceptive.

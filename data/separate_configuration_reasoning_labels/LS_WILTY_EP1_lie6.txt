The subject's smile, combined with lip corners both turning up and down, presents an intriguing blend of expressions that can be interpreted in multiple ways. A genuine smile with lifted lip corners often indicates comfort and sincerity, suggesting truthfulness. However, when those upward curvatures are interspersed with downward movements, it could signal a masking of true emotions, possibly hinting at underlying discomfort or deceit. Similarly, the presence of raised eyebrows can signify surprise or openness, traits commonly associated with honesty. Yet, exaggerated raising of the eyebrows might be a deliberate attempt to emphasize truthfulness or to lure the interlocutor into a false sense of security.

Their eye behavior, including exaggerated eye closing and fluctuating gaze—from direct looks toward the interlocutor to sideways glances—adds further complexity. Direct gaze might imply confidence and candor, yet it can also be consciously maintained by someone attempting to appear sincere despite fabricating information. Conversely, looking sideways could reflect evasion or uncertainty, often linked to deceptive behavior, although it might just as easily indicate the person is searching their memory or feeling momentarily self-conscious. Head tilting can be a sign of engagement and empathy, which aligns with honest communication, but it may also serve as a subtle compensatory gesture intended to soften the impact of less truthful statements.

Each of these behaviors, therefore, carries a dual potential: as markers of genuine interaction or as strategic cues potentially employed to mask deceit. Without additional context—such as verbal content, baseline behavior patterns, and the nature of the interaction—it remains challenging to definitively categorize these signals. Careful synthesis of these elements is essential to form a more reliable judgment regarding the subject’s truthfulness.

The subject’s downward movement of the chin can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it may suggest a subtle attempt to conceal discomfort or hesitation, which could be indicative of withholding information or deception. Conversely, this gesture might simply reflect a natural change in posture or a moment of thoughtfulness, with no connection to dishonesty. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor generally signals engagement and openness, which could support the notion of truthfulness. However, intense or fixed eye contact might also be employed as a deliberate strategy to convince or distract the other party, potentially masking deceit. Meanwhile, the occasional gaze downward introduces a further layer of ambiguity; such behavior is often considered a sign of evasion or internal conflict, possibly hinting at deception. Yet, looking down can equally be a sign of cognitive processing or modesty, serving as a neutral or even positive indicator depending on the context. Ultimately, these behaviors taken individually or together cannot definitively confirm truthfulness or deception without considering the broader situational and relational factors at play.

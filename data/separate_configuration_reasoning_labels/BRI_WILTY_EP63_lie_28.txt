The subject’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, a smile might be a genuine expression of ease and openness, signaling comfort and honesty in the interaction. Alternatively, it could be a calculated attempt to mask discomfort or to manipulate the impression they are making, serving as a social lubricant to conceal dishonest intentions. Similarly, their arms being folded presents a dual narrative. This posture might indicate a defensive or closed-off attitude, potentially suggesting that the person is emotionally guarding themselves in order to hide something untruthful. Conversely, it could also simply reflect a natural resting position or a response to environmental factors such as feeling cold, rather than any psychological barrier. Without additional context to understand the person’s baseline behaviors, emotional state, and the dynamics of the interaction, these signals remain ambiguous and cannot conclusively indicate truthfulness or deception.

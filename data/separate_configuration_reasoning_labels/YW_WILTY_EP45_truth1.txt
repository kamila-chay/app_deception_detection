The individual’s gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and lowering their eyes, can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Direct eye contact is often seen as a sign of honesty and engagement, suggesting a willingness to communicate openly and truthfully. However, it can also be consciously maintained by someone attempting to appear sincere while fabricating information, using steady eye contact as a strategy to mask their deceit. Conversely, the moments when the person looks down could imply discomfort or an internal struggle with their own narrative, possibly indicating evasion or withholding of information. Yet, this downward gaze might simply reflect a natural cognitive process, such as recalling details or reflecting on the question posed, rather than an intent to deceive. In isolation, these gaze patterns cannot conclusively determine truthfulness or deception; they must be weighed alongside additional behavioral cues and situational factors to form a more accurate assessment.

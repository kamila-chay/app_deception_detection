The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might reflect a genuine reaction of surprise or emphasis, suggesting that the person is engaged and truthful in their communication. On the other hand, raised eyebrows can sometimes be a deliberate attempt to feign sincerity or to elicit empathy, which might be indicative of deceptive intent. The subtlety of the motion and its congruence with the verbal message are crucial factors to consider.

Their gaze towards the interlocutor also presents a dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and openness, reinforcing the impression of honesty. Conversely, some individuals consciously maintain steady eye contact precisely to mask deception, using this as a strategy to appear credible. This behavior alone is not definitive without understanding the person’s usual eye contact patterns and cultural background.

The tendency to gaze upward invites similar ambiguity. Looking upward can sometimes be associated with cognitive effort, as individuals search their memory for truthful details. In contrast, it can also be a sign of fabricating information or disengaging from the present moment to construct a false narrative. Context surrounding the content being discussed is essential to clarify this behavior’s underlying meaning.

Lastly, the head tilting may indicate attentiveness and genuine interest, contributing positively to the perception of honesty. However, it can alternatively signify discomfort or an attempt to appear more agreeable while consciously navigating the conversation to avoid detection. The overall congruence of head movements with other communicative cues and the emotional tone of the interaction should be considered to discern its significance.

In sum, each of these behaviors—raising eyebrows, gazing towards the interlocutor or upward, and tilting the head—can be interpreted variably, either as authentic communicative signals or as potential indicators of deception, depending heavily on additional context and baseline behavioral norms.

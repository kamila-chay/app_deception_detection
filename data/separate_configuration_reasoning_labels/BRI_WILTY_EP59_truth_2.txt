The subject’s facial expression includes raising their eyebrows, which can be interpreted in different ways depending on the broader context. Raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, signaling openness and engagement. Conversely, this same gesture could also be a conscious effort to appear more convincing or to mask uncertainty, potentially indicating deception. Their gaze behavior further complicates the analysis; maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor can be a strong sign of sincerity and confidence, reflecting genuine interest and truthfulness. However, some individuals deliberately hold steady eye contact to overcompensate and appear truthful when fabricating information, meaning this behavior alone is not definitive. The subject’s gaze also shifts upward at times, which might be linked to accessing visual memories, supporting the idea that they are recalling truthful details. Yet, it is also known that such gaze shifts can be part of cognitive processes involved in constructing a deceptive narrative. Similarly, occasional sideways glances might be read as signs of discomfort or attempts to avoid scrutiny, hinting at potential deception. On the other hand, these glances may simply reflect natural moments of distraction or the cognitive load involved in thoughtful communication. Ultimately, the meaning behind these combined behaviors—raised eyebrows and varied gaze patterns—cannot be fully discerned without considering the wider context, including verbal cues and baseline behaviors, to arrive at a more grounded interpretation of the subject’s truthfulness.

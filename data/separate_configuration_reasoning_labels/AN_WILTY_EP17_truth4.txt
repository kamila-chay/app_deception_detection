The subject’s direct gaze toward the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest sincerity and confidence, indicating that the person is being truthful and open. It can reflect engagement and a willingness to connect authentically. Conversely, sustained eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, as some individuals overcompensate for dishonesty by trying to appear more trustworthy through intense or prolonged staring. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether the gaze signifies honesty or an attempt to manipulate perception.

Similarly, the posture of having arms open presents a dual perspective. An open arm position is often associated with openness and receptivity, which might imply that the person is comfortable and forthcoming with information. This posture can serve as a nonverbal cue reinforcing the person’s transparency and truthful intent. Conversely, open arms might also be a calculated display designed to project approachability and disarm suspicion, potentially serving as a façade intended to conceal underlying deceptive motives. The broader context, including the person’s baseline behavior and environmental factors, is crucial in discerning whether this openness is genuine or performative.

Ultimately, these visible behaviors alone do not conclusively indicate truthfulness or deceit. They can be convincingly interpreted in both directions depending on surrounding cues and the overall interaction dynamics. As such, a comprehensive analysis that incorporates additional verbal and nonverbal signals, as well as contextual information, is essential for a more reliable assessment.

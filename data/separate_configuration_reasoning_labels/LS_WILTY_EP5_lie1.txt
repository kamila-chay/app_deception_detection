The person’s raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially signaling openness and honesty. Conversely, this same gesture might be interpreted as a subtle expression of skepticism or disbelief, which can sometimes be a deliberate signal to mislead or distract. Their mouth remains closed, which might indicate careful thought and control over their words, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. On the other hand, a tightly closed mouth could be a sign of withholding information or discomfort, both of which may align with deceptive behavior. The act of protruding lips might be a natural facial expression or a sign of concentration, reflecting genuine engagement in the conversation. Alternatively, it could reveal suppressed frustration or hesitation, which can be linked to deception as the individual grapples with fabricating a response.

Similarly, when the lips retract, this could be part of a spontaneous emotional reaction, such as amusement or disbelief, lending credibility to their statements. Yet, it might also indicate tension or an attempt to mask true feelings, complicating the interpretation of their honesty. The downward movement of the chin might denote humility or submission, suggesting an earnest attempt to communicate openly. Conversely, it can also be a defensive posture meant to avoid confrontation or scrutiny, which suspects sometimes adopt when being deceptive.

Their gaze alternates between directed attention towards the interlocutor and occasional downward looks. Direct eye contact often signals confidence and truthfulness, yet in some cases, it may be consciously maintained to feign sincerity. Looking down can be a natural moment of reflection or modesty, but it might also signal avoidance or discomfort associated with deception. Tilting the head may indicate curiosity and openness, a nonverbal cue often linked to genuine interest and engagement. However, it can also function as a calculated behavior to appear more likeable or cooperative when trying to mislead. Sideways turning of the head might suggest a willingness to listen and consider the other’s point of view, reinforcing honesty. Alternatively, it may be a subtle way to distance oneself psychologically from the topic or the interlocutor, which could be consistent with evasiveness.

Finally, the individual’s head shaking can be interpreted as an emphatic denial or assertion of truth, reinforcing their verbal message. Yet, the same gesture might be a defensive reflex or an attempt to overemphasize negation, potentially betraying an underlying untruth. In sum, these behaviors taken together provide multiple plausible readings; without additional context or baseline knowledge of the individual’s typical nonverbal patterns, it remains challenging to definitively conclude whether they are being truthful or deceptive.

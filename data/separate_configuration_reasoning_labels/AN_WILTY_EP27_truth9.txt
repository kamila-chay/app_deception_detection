The individual’s gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and occasionally glancing upward, offers intriguing but ambiguous cues when attempting to discern truthfulness. Maintaining eye contact can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and honesty, suggesting that the person is engaged and comfortable with the interaction. This direct gaze might imply transparency and a willingness to connect openly with the listener. Conversely, sustained eye contact can sometimes be a strategic effort to appear convincing or to mask deceit, as some people consciously or unconsciously use strong eye contact to deflect suspicion.

On the other hand, the upward gaze could indicate that the person is accessing visual memories or engaging in thoughtful reflection, which supports the possibility of recalling truthful information. This behavior is often associated with cognitive processing and genuine retrieval of details from past experiences. Yet, the same upward movement can also be viewed skeptically, as it may reflect mental fabrication or the construction of alternative narratives. Some psychological theories propose that people look away or upward when formulating responses they intend to be deceptive.

Ultimately, these gaze patterns in isolation do not definitively reveal truthfulness or deception. The interpretation of such behaviors greatly depends on the context, the person’s baseline behavior, and other accompanying verbal and non-verbal cues. Only by integrating these factors can a more nuanced and reliable assessment be formed.

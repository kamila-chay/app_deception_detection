The subject’s raised eyebrows may be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, this expression could signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, which are often associated with telling the truth. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a deliberate attempt to appear sincere or to mask discomfort, potentially indicating a deceptive intent. Similarly, the frequency of their blinking might suggest nervousness or stress, which could be symptomatic of someone concealing information or fabricating a story. However, frequent blinking can equally be a natural physiological response to dryness or fatigue, or simply a habitual behavior unrelated to deceit. Their gaze toward the interlocutor demonstrates engagement and attentiveness, traits commonly linked to genuine communication and transparent behavior. Yet, persistent eye contact can also be consciously maintained to project confidence and avoid suspicion, possibly as a strategy employed by someone who is being untruthful. Meanwhile, their occasional sideways gaze could imply evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct engagement, which might hint at deceptive intentions. On the other hand, looking sideways may reflect a cognitive process of recalling details, or momentary distraction unrelated to deceit. The forward movement of their head may indicate an earnest effort to connect and assert credibility, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness. Alternatively, this subtle gesture might signal an attempt to control the interaction or apply subtle pressure, which could be construed as manipulative behavior. Ultimately, these behaviors require interpretation within a broader context to discern whether they are indicative of honesty or deception.

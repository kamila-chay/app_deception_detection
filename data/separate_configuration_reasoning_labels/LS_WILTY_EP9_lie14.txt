The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways; on one hand, this gesture might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, potentially indicating truthfulness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle cue of feigned astonishment or incredulity, possibly masking deception. The exaggerated opening of the mouth may suggest a desire to appear transparent and candid, as if trying to convey sincerity through expressive facial cues. However, such over-exaggeration can also be perceived as an unnatural attempt to convince the listener, hinting at possible fabrication.

Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor is often considered a sign of engagement and truthfulness, as maintaining eye contact can communicate confidence and openness. Yet, it is also conceivable that such a gaze is deliberately maintained to manipulate perceptions and project an image of honesty, which could be part of a deceptive strategy. The subject’s nodding could indicate agreement and reinforce their statements, suggesting sincerity. Alternatively, repeated or exaggerated nodding might be employed as a tactic to persuade or gain favor, which complicates interpretation.

With respect to the head tilting, this behavior might denote curiosity and attentiveness, traits consistent with honest communication. Still, head tilting can equally be used strategically to appear more approachable or non-threatening when attempting to deceive. The head shaking introduces further ambiguity; it may signal disagreement or self-correction, reinforcing truthful intentions, or it could subtly contradict verbal statements, casting doubt on their veracity. Lastly, the subject’s open arms could be viewed as a gesture of openness and receptiveness, supporting an impression of truthfulness. On the other hand, open arms might be a conscious effort to appear vulnerable or sincere, potentially serving as a disarming technique in the context of deception.

In sum, each observed behavior holds dual interpretations depending on the broader conversational context, the subject’s baseline demeanor, and the nuances of the interaction. Drawing firm conclusions about truthfulness or deception requires integrating these signals with additional contextual information and corroborative evidence.

The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of deception detection. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, suggesting engagement and sincerity. Conversely, this same gesture could be employed strategically to feign innocence or to distract from inconsistencies in their story, potentially indicating deception. Their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor is similarly subject to dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact may reflect confidence and truthfulness, conveying that the individual has nothing to hide. However, it could also be a deliberate effort to appear credible, as some deceptive individuals consciously sustain eye contact to counteract suspicions. The nodding observed might signify agreement and attentiveness, reinforcing a genuine willingness to communicate honestly. Yet, it can also serve as a rehearsed cue to persuade or manipulate the listener, masking deceit through seemingly affirming gestures. Head tilting, often associated with curiosity or empathy, could be a natural expression of interest in the conversation, supporting a truthful interaction. On the other hand, it might be employed to soften the speaker’s demeanor, creating a facade of openness while concealing underlying falsehoods. Finally, the palms-up gesture frequently conveys openness and honesty, hinting at transparency in the subject's communication. Alternatively, it might be a practiced gesture aimed at eliciting trust and sympathy, thus potentially facilitating deceptive intentions. Each behavior, therefore, holds a credible place on both ends of the truthfulness spectrum, and without additional contextual information, it remains essential to consider these signals cautiously rather than drawing definitive conclusions.

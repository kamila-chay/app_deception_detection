The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor might suggest engagement and honesty, as maintaining eye contact is often interpreted as a sign of confidence and sincerity. Conversely, this same behavior could be a deliberate strategy to assert trustworthiness and mask deceit, as some individuals maintain steady eye contact to avoid suspicion. When the person looks down, it might indicate discomfort or the cognitive effort involved in fabricating information, which can be a subtle cue to deception. Alternatively, looking downward may simply reflect reflection, processing emotions, or modesty, rather than an attempt to conceal the truth. The display of palms upwards is commonly viewed as an open and non-threatening gesture, signaling transparency and a willingness to be honest. However, this gesture could also be consciously employed to project openness and encourage belief, potentially serving as a manipulative tactic. Similarly, having arms open can be read as a sign of openness and receptivity, fostering trust in the interaction. Yet, it may also represent a rehearsed posture intended to appear more credible and disarm skepticism. Each of these behaviors carries dual potential meanings, and without broader contextual information or baseline behavioral analysis, it remains challenging to definitively interpret them as indicators of deception or truthfulness.

The subject’s raised eyebrows may suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially indicating truthfulness. However, raised eyebrows can also be a deliberate effort to feign openness or exaggerate emotions, which might hint at deception depending on the context. Their protruded lips could signal tension or discomfort, possibly arising from the stress of fabricating information, yet this gesture might also simply reflect concentration or a natural speaking style unrelated to deceit. The movements of their chin—both upwards and downwards—introduce further complexity; a chin raised might convey confidence and assertiveness, supporting credibility, whereas it could also imply defensiveness or arrogance, traits sometimes linked with deceptive behavior. Conversely, a downward chin movement might demonstrate submission or uncertainty, which could align with honesty, but similarly may reflect apprehension masking dishonesty.

Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor often suggests engagement and transparency, fostering trust and indicating truthful communication. Nonetheless, steady eye contact can also be a practiced technique used by someone trying to convince others of a falsehood. The presence of nodding generally appears as a sign of agreement and comprehension, reinforcing the impression of openness; yet, it might be an automatic or strategic behavior intended to placate or persuade, which complicates straightforward interpretation. Forward head movements may signal eagerness or emphasis on the message, implying conviction and honesty, but they could also be employed to assert dominance or to distract from deception. Meanwhile, a head side-turn can express contemplation or discomfort, possibly reflecting honesty in processing difficult information, though it might equally indicate avoidance or evasion, markers often scrutinized in deception detection.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors carries dual potential meanings, underscoring the importance of considering the broader context and additional cues before drawing firm conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness or deceit.

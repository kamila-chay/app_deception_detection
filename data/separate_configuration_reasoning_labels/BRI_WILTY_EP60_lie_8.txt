The subject raises their eyebrows during the interaction, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, which could suggest genuine engagement and honesty. Conversely, they may also serve as a subtle attempt to manipulate or feign innocence when fabricating information. The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior often associated with sincerity and openness; however, persistent eye contact can sometimes be consciously maintained to mask deceit, thereby complicating the interpretation. Their gaze occasionally shifts upwards, which some theories propose may indicate cognitive effort or accessing internal memories, possibly reflecting truthful recollection. Alternatively, this upward gaze might be a sign of imaginative construction or evasion. Furthermore, the person shrugs at certain moments, a gesture that can convey uncertainty or lack of information, potentially consistent with truthfulness if the subject genuinely does not know an answer. Yet, a shrug can equally function as a nonverbal tactic to deflect responsibility or avoid providing a direct response. Each of these behaviors, thus, carries ambiguous meanings and must be considered within the broader context of the interaction, including verbal content, baseline behaviors, and situational factors, to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the subject’s veracity.

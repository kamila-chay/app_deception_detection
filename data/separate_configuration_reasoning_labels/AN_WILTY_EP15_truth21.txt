The subject's frowning eyebrows might be interpreted as a sign of cognitive strain or discomfort, which could suggest they are struggling to maintain a fabricated story or conceal the truth. Conversely, this same expression might simply reflect concentration, confusion, or emotional engagement with the topic at hand, rather than deceit. Their exaggerated eye closing could be viewed as a deliberate attempt to avoid eye contact or signal discomfort, potentially indicating a desire to withhold information or mask true feelings. Yet, this behavior could also be a natural physiological response to bright lighting, tiredness, or even an unconscious habitual gesture unrelated to honesty. Meanwhile, their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might be taken as a sign of confidence and openness, often associated with truthfulness; maintaining eye contact can suggest a willingness to engage transparently. On the other hand, some individuals who are deceptive might overcompensate by locking their gaze on the listener, aiming to project sincerity and control the impression they make. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader context, as each cue carries multiple plausible explanations and must be weighed alongside other verbal and nonverbal signals.

The subject consistently directs their gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact is often seen as a sign of honesty and engagement, suggesting that the person is confident in what they are communicating and has nothing to conceal. This direct gaze might indicate transparency and a willingness to connect authentically with the listener. On the other hand, maintaining steady eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy used to mask deception, as individuals who fabricate stories may focus intensely on the interlocutor to convey an appearance of sincerity and to avoid suspicion. Moreover, some people naturally tend to hold eye contact longer regardless of their truthfulness, so this behavior alone does not provide conclusive evidence. Without additional cues or context, interpreting the gaze as either a sign of truthfulness or deception remains tentative, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive assessment when forming judgments about the subject’s veracity.

The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might indicate genuine positive emotion and openness, suggesting they feel comfortable and truthful in the interaction. However, such expressions can also be consciously employed as social tools to mask discomfort or fabricate sincerity, potentially serving as a façade in deceptive contexts. The raising of the eyebrows can be interpreted as a sign of surprise or emphasis, which might reinforce the authenticity of their statements by signaling honest engagement. Conversely, this same behavior could be strategically used to appear more credible or to elicit empathy, thereby complicating efforts to discern truthfulness. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor often reflects attentiveness and a desire to connect, which aligns with truthful communication. Yet, maintaining eye contact may also be a calculated effort to convince or manipulate, and therefore is not an unequivocal indicator of honesty. Notably, the gaze shifting downwards introduces ambiguity; it might suggest momentary reflection or processing of information consistent with truthful responses, or it could signify discomfort and avoidance associated with deception. Ultimately, each of these behaviors can be framed as either corroborative or contradictory in the context of deception, highlighting the importance of considering the broader interactive and situational context before drawing conclusions about veracity.

The person’s frequent gaze toward the interlocutor could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest honesty and engagement, as they seem willing to connect and communicate openly. Conversely, it might also reflect a conscious effort to appear trustworthy and mask deceptive intent, using steady eye contact as a tool to convince the listener. Their moments of gaze downward similarly invite dual interpretations: this behavior might indicate discomfort or internal conflict commonly associated with deception, as they momentarily break eye contact to manage cognitive load or emotional stress. Yet, it could also simply signify reflection or the need to recall information, with the downward gaze serving as a natural cognitive pause rather than a sign of dishonesty.

The head side-turn introduces further ambiguity. It could be seen as a subtle distancing gesture or a sign of evasion, hinting at reluctance or concealment. Alternatively, it may reflect open-mindedness or contemplation, where the individual is thoughtfully processing what is being said rather than deliberately avoiding engagement. Meanwhile, the palms-up gesture holds its own complex meanings. This posture can be read as a sincere display of openness and a desire to be transparent, reinforcing a truthful stance. At the same time, it might be a calculated nonverbal cue designed to elicit trust or sympathy, strategically employed to enhance the credibility of a fabricated narrative.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors can be interpreted as either indicative of honesty or potential deception, depending greatly on the broader context, individual baseline behavior, and the interaction dynamics. Careful consideration of the cumulative behavioral patterns and situational factors is essential before drawing reliable conclusions.

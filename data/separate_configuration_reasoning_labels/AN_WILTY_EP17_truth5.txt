The person’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest sincerity and openness, as individuals who are truthful often seek to establish trust and connection through direct engagement. Their steady gaze might indicate confidence in their statements and a genuine willingness to communicate clearly. Conversely, sustained eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy employed by someone attempting to persuade or manipulate, using gaze as a tool to appear earnest and divert suspicion. In some cases, individuals may overcompensate for lying by forcing direct eye contact, knowing that avoiding it is commonly associated with deception. Without further behavioral cues or contextual information, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the gaze signifies honesty or a calculated effort to conceal the truth.

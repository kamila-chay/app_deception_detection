The individual’s frowning eyebrows could potentially signal cognitive effort or discomfort, which might suggest they are grappling with fabricating information or experiencing the stress of deception. Conversely, this same expression can simply reflect concentration or confusion unrelated to dishonesty, particularly if the topic is complex or emotionally charged. Their raising eyebrows might indicate surprise or emphasis, which could be interpreted as a genuine reaction to unexpected questions or statements, lending credibility to their truthfulness. However, raised eyebrows might also be a deliberate display to feign innocence or create an impression of openness, serving as a subtle attempt to manipulate perception.

Frequent blinking is often cited as a sign of nervousness, possibly stemming from the strain of maintaining a fabricated narrative or hiding the truth. Yet, blinking rates can increase due to environmental factors such as lighting, dryness of the eyes, or simply as a habitual response, devoid of any deceptive intent. The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor could be read as an attempt to establish rapport or demonstrate honesty, signaling engagement and transparency. In contrast, maintaining strong eye contact might also be a conscious strategy to mask deceit by projecting confidence and sincerity.

On the other hand, moments where the individual’s gaze shifts downward could suggest avoidance behaviors linked to discomfort with dishonesty or guilt. However, looking down may just as easily indicate thoughtfulness or introspection as the person recalls information or formulates their response. Ultimately, these behaviors on their own provide ambiguous cues; their interpretation depends heavily on the broader context, including baseline behaviors, situational factors, and corroborating evidence, to more accurately discern truthfulness or deception.

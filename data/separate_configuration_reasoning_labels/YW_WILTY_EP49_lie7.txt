The person is raising their eyebrows while engaging with the interlocutor, a gesture that could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating genuine engagement or honesty in the conversation. Conversely, this same expression might serve as a subtle attempt to feign innocence or emphasize fabricated information, which could suggest deception. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor also holds ambiguous implications. Maintaining eye contact might reflect confidence and sincerity, implying a truthful disposition. However, it could equally be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and mask inconsistencies. Without additional contextual cues, these behaviors alone do not definitively indicate truthfulness or deceit, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive assessment.

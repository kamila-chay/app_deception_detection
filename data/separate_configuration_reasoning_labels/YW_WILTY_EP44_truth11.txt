The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways; on one hand, this expression might suggest concentration or discomfort that accompanies fabricating information, signaling potential deception. On the other hand, frowning can simply indicate genuine confusion or frustration as they attempt to recall truthful details, reflecting honest engagement rather than deceit. Similarly, the action of raising eyebrows might be perceived as a sign of surprise or exaggerated expression intended to persuade or distract, which could hint at insincerity. Conversely, raised eyebrows often accompany genuine surprise or an earnest reaction, underscoring truthful communication.

Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor can imply attentiveness and openness, which are generally consistent with truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to convince or manipulate, casting some doubt on their credibility. The moments when the subject looks down might signal discomfort or evasiveness often associated with lying, yet it could equally reflect a natural tendency to gather thoughts or manage emotional overwhelm without dishonest intent.

A side-turn of the head may suggest avoidance or reluctance to fully engage, potentially pointing to concealing information. Conversely, it might simply reflect a momentary shift in attention or a natural conversational gesture, detached from any deceptive motivation. Their palms held up and arms open are classic indicators of openness and honesty, signaling a willingness to engage transparently. Still, it should be noted that these gestures can be consciously employed as part of a rehearsed performance to foster trust and mask deceit.

Ultimately, these behaviors are ambiguous and must be interpreted within a broader context, including verbal cues and situational factors, before drawing concrete conclusions regarding the subject’s truthfulness or deception.

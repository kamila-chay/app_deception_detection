The subject’s raised eyebrows may suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, signaling openness and engagement. Conversely, this same gesture could be a subtle cue of disbelief or an exaggerated effort to appear truthful, especially if the expression seems out of sync with the verbal message or context. Their gaze directed sideways might be interpreted as evasion or discomfort, potentially indicating that they are avoiding direct eye contact to hide something. However, it could also reflect momentary distraction, cognitive processing, or simply a natural way of accessing memory, which does not necessarily imply deception. When the person displays open palms facing upwards, this can be viewed as a sign of sincerity and willingness to communicate transparently. Yet, this same gesture might be strategically employed to convey innocence and build trust, even if the underlying intent is to mislead. Without additional contextual cues, it remains challenging to definitively interpret these behaviors as indicators of either truthfulness or deception, highlighting the importance of considering the broader interaction and baseline tendencies.

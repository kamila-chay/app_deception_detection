The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be interpreted in different ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, a genuine smile often conveys comfort and sincerity, suggesting they are being truthful. On the other hand, a smile can also serve as a social mask, deliberately employed to deflect suspicion or mask discomfort, which might hint at deception. Their gaze behavior also offers mixed signals. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor might be seen as a sign of engagement and honesty, as people generally avoid direct gaze when being untruthful. Conversely, deliberate or prolonged eye contact can sometimes be a calculated attempt to assert credibility and control the impression they are making, potentially indicating deception. The moments when their gaze drops downward introduce another layer of ambiguity. Looking down might signal nervousness or shame commonly associated with deceit, but it can also represent a natural cognitive process of recalling information or simply be a cultural or personal habit that is unrelated to dishonesty. Finally, the positioning of the head held up can be perceived as a display of confidence and openness, reinforcing the notion of truthfulness. However, it may also be a conscious effort to project authority and conceal uncertainty or evasiveness. Ultimately, these behaviors, taken in isolation, offer plausible arguments on either side, and a thorough understanding of the broader context and baseline behavior is crucial for a more definitive interpretation.

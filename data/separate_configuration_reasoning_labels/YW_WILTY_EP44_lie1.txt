The individual’s frowning eyebrows might be perceived as a sign of discomfort or cognitive strain, potentially indicating that they are struggling to maintain a fabricated story or suppress the truth. This expression could reflect the mental effort involved in deception, where the person experiences internal conflict or anxiety. Conversely, the furrowed brows may simply signify concentration or confusion, suggesting that the person is thoughtfully processing the conversation or reacting naturally to the topic at hand without any intent to deceive. The gaze directed toward the interlocutor similarly offers dual possibilities. Maintaining eye contact can be interpreted as an attempt to appear sincere and trustworthy, reinforcing the perception of honesty. On the other hand, it might be a conscious effort to overcompensate for dishonesty, where the person believes that sustained eye contact will make their statements appear more credible. However, the direct gaze could also indicate engagement and genuine interest in the dialogue, rather than any manipulative intent. Ultimately, these behaviors in isolation cannot conclusively reveal deception or truthfulness; a broader understanding of context, baseline behavior, and additional nonverbal cues is essential to form a more accurate assessment.

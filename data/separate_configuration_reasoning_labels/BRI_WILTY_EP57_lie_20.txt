The individual’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor may be indicative of honest engagement and a sincere attempt to communicate openly. Maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and transparency, suggesting that the person has nothing to hide. Conversely, this same behavior can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to project credibility and deflect suspicion, as some individuals may consciously sustain eye contact in order to appear truthful despite deceptive intentions. Similarly, their nodding could be interpreted as a genuine sign of active listening and agreement, reflecting attentiveness and affirmation of the conversation. However, nodding may also serve as a calculated tactic to encourage the interlocutor to continue speaking or to create the illusion of cooperation, potentially masking underlying deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered within the broader conversational and contextual framework, as they alone do not conclusively confirm truthfulness or deception.

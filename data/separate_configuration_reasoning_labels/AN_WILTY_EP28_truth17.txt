The individual’s chin moving downwards can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. This gesture might suggest hesitation or self-protection, potentially reflecting discomfort associated with deceit. Conversely, it could simply be a natural movement expressing thoughtfulness or concentration, with no connection to dishonesty. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor similarly allows for dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and openness, indicating truthfulness. However, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere or to monitor the other person’s reactions while fabricating information. The act of nodding generally conveys agreement and engagement, which might suggest that the person is sincere and affirming what they say. At the same time, nodding can be a learned social behavior used to persuade or gain trust, possibly masking insincerity. Lastly, the subject’s open arms posture tends to be perceived as a sign of openness and vulnerability, which would support the possibility of honesty. On the other hand, it may also be a strategic move to appear non-threatening and genuine, serving as a form of psychological camouflage. Each of these behaviors must therefore be interpreted within a comprehensive framework that considers the individual’s baseline behavior, cultural factors, and the overall interaction to more reliably discern truthfulness from deception.

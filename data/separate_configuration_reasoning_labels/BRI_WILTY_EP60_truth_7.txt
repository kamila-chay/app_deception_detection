The subject’s frowning eyebrows may suggest a range of emotional states that could either support or challenge the assumption of deception. On one hand, furrowing the brows might indicate discomfort or stress, which can sometimes accompany the effort to conceal or distort information. This expression might reflect the mental strain involved in fabricating details. However, it is equally plausible that the frown stems from genuine concentration, concern, or confusion, particularly if the topic under discussion is complex or emotionally charged. Without additional context, this behavior alone does not distinguish truthfulness from deception.

Similarly, the sideways gaze can be interpreted through multiple lenses. From one perspective, looking away rather than maintaining direct eye contact might be seen as an attempt to avoid scrutiny or to mask dishonesty, as some cultural norms associate sustained eye contact with honesty. It might also indicate that the person is engaged in cognitive processing required to construct a narrative, possibly fabricated. Conversely, a sideways glance could simply reflect an effort to recall memory details, shift attention momentarily, or regulate social discomfort, all of which are normal and not inherently linked to deceit. It may also be influenced by environmental factors or conversational dynamics unrelated to veracity.

Taken together, these visible behaviors—frowning eyebrows and sideways gaze—could point toward nervousness or cognitive load typically associated with deception, yet they are equally consistent with truthful engagement marked by thoughtfulness, emotional response, or natural social behavior. To form a well-rounded assessment of the subject’s truthfulness, these cues should be interpreted within the broader context including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational variables.

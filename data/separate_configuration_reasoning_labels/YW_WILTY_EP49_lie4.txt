The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, sustained eye contact often signifies confidence and a willingness to engage openly, which may support the notion that the person is being truthful. On the other hand, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear convincing and mask any deceptive intentions, as some individuals maintain intense eye contact to avoid detection. Similarly, their act of nodding can suggest active listening and agreement, reinforcing the impression of honesty and genuine involvement in the conversation. Yet, nodding might also be used manipulatively to encourage the interlocutor’s trust or to feign understanding when fabricating information. The gesture of holding palms up is frequently associated with openness and honesty, as it can symbolize a lack of concealment and a readiness to be transparent. Conversely, this same gesture could be part of a rehearsed posture designed to project sincerity and goodwill, even if the content being conveyed is untruthful. In the absence of additional contextual cues, each of these behaviors remains ambiguous, and drawing definitive conclusions about deception or truthfulness requires careful consideration of the broader situational and verbal context.

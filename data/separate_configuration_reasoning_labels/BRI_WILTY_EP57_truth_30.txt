They are raising their eyebrows, a gesture that might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, potentially reinforcing the credibility of their statements. Conversely, eyebrow raising can also be a subtle sign of uncertainty or disbelief, perhaps indicating discomfort with the truth or the effort to fabricate a response. Their nodding may be interpreted as a sincere affirmation of what is being said, reflecting engagement and agreement, which generally supports the notion of truthfulness. On the other hand, nodding can sometimes serve as a strategic behavior to persuade the listener, possibly masking deceit by creating an illusion of agreement. The subject’s head shaking introduces further complexity; it could signify genuine disagreement or correcting a misconception, aligning with truthful communication. Alternatively, head shaking might be employed to deflect or deny accusations, serving as a nonverbal cue to conceal dishonesty. Each of these behaviors must be considered within the broader context of the interaction, as their meaning can shift dramatically depending on additional verbal and nonverbal signals as well as situational factors.

The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest confidence and honesty, as truthful individuals often engage openly and seek to establish trust through visual connection. It could indicate that the person is comfortable with the information they are sharing and is attempting to be transparent. On the other hand, sustained or intense eye contact can also be a deliberate tactic used by someone who is deceptive, aiming to convince the listener of their sincerity and to distract from any underlying falsehoods. In some cases, individuals may overcompensate by staring more than usual to mask feelings of guilt or nervousness. Moreover, cultural or personal differences in eye contact behavior must be considered, as some people naturally engage more visually regardless of their truthfulness. Without additional cues or contextual information, the presence of gaze towards the interlocutor alone cannot definitively indicate honesty or deception and should be interpreted within a broader framework of behavioral signals and situational factors.

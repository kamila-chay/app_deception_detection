The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, which would support a truthful disposition. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle cue to mask uncertainty or fabricate confidence, potentially indicating deception. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways. Direct eye contact can be a sign of engagement and sincerity, yet excessive or overly deliberate gazes might also reflect conscious effort to control the narrative, hinting at possible dishonesty. Meanwhile, occasional sideways glances could suggest evasiveness or discomfort in a deceptive scenario, but they might just as well represent moments of internal reflection or searching for accurate memories. The backward movement of the head adds another layer of ambiguity; it could signal distancing or defensiveness often associated with withholding the truth, but equally, it might simply be a natural reaction to physical or emotional stimulus unrelated to deceit. Similarly, the head tilting could reflect openness and active listening, affirming their willingness to communicate honestly, or it might be an unconscious attempt to appear more agreeable and persuasive while being untruthful. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated in the broader context of the interaction and corroborated with additional cues to arrive at a well-founded conclusion.

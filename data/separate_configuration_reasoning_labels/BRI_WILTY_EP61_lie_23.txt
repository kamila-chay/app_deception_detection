The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or uncertainty, which could suggest that the person is trying to process information carefully to maintain a fabricated story. This expression could be a subtle indicator of discomfort or an unconscious attempt to gauge the listener’s reaction. Conversely, raised eyebrows are also a common nonverbal cue associated with genuine engagement or curiosity, and may simply reflect a natural response to dialogue or a desire to emphasize sincerity. Without further context, this gesture could equally represent openness rather than concealment.

Similarly, the tendency to gaze downward invites dual interpretations. In some cases, looking down is often linked to evasiveness or an effort to avoid eye contact, which might be interpreted as an attempt to hide something or shield oneself from judgment, traits frequently observed in deceptive behavior. Yet, it is equally plausible that a downward gaze reflects introspection or the mental effort to recall truthful information, especially under pressure. This behavior might also be rooted in cultural norms or personal habits unrelated to deceit. Therefore, the downward gaze cannot be conclusively regarded as a sign of dishonesty without considering the broader interactional context and individual differences.

Both raising eyebrows and gazing downward carry ambiguous meanings that could support arguments for or against the subject’s truthfulness. The interpretation of these behaviors is highly contingent on additional contextual information, such as the circumstances of the exchange, verbal content, and baseline behavior, to arrive at a reasoned assessment of honesty or deception.

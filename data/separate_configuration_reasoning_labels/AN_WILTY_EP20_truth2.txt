They are gazing sideways, a behavior that can carry multiple interpretations depending on the broader context. On one hand, a sideways gaze might be indicative of discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which some studies suggest can be associated with deceptive behavior as the person may be trying to distance themselves from the narrative they are presenting. This avoidance could signal internal conflict or an effort to conceal something sensitive. On the other hand, looking sideways is also a common mannerism rooted in cognitive processing, such as trying to retrieve complex memories or thoughtfully considering a response, rather than an expression of deceit. It could simply reflect the natural way the person organizes their thoughts or is distracted by environmental stimuli. Without additional behavioral cues or context about the situation, this sideways gaze alone cannot definitively point to either truthfulness or deception, emphasizing the necessity of a holistic evaluation.

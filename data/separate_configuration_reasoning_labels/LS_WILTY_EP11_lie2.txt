The subject’s smile, combined with lip corners turning upward, might suggest a genuine attempt to convey friendliness or confidence, which could indicate honesty. However, such expressions can also be consciously employed to mask discomfort or to manipulate the perception of truthfulness. Their frowning eyebrows present a contrasting signal; this tension could reflect cognitive strain associated with fabricating information, yet it might equally signify concentration or emotional engagement with the topic at hand. Similarly, the raising of eyebrows is often interpreted as a sign of surprise or emphasis, potentially pointing to truthful reactions, but it could just as well be a rehearsed cue to appear convincing. 

The subject’s gaze direction offers a dual perspective as well. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor can convey openness and sincerity, though it might also be a deliberate strategy to project confidence and deter suspicion. Conversely, moments when the gaze shifts downward might be read as avoidance stemming from guilt or discomfort, yet they can also indicate reflection or an attempt to retrieve accurate memories. Movements of the head, including moving forward, tilting, turning to the side, and holding it up, further illustrate this ambiguity. Forward head movement could signal engagement and honesty by showing initiative in the conversation, or it could reflect aggressive dominance designed to intimidate or control the narrative. Tilting or turning the head may express curiosity or active listening, or alternatively, they might be subtle cues of discomfort and evasion. Holding the head up might be seen as a posture of confidence and truthfulness, but it could equally be an overcompensating gesture masking uncertainty.

Ultimately, these behaviors, when considered in isolation, each carry interpretations that support both truthful and deceptive motives. A comprehensive understanding requires integrating these signals with the broader context of the interaction, the subject’s baseline behavior, and additional verbal and nonverbal cues to make a more informed judgment.

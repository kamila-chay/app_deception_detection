The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor may suggest a level of engagement and confidence, which could be interpreted as a sign of truthfulness and openness in the conversation. Maintaining eye contact is often associated with honesty because it signals that the person has nothing to hide. However, it is important to consider that such behavior could also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere and credible, especially if the individual is attempting to deceive. In some contexts, sustained eye contact might be used to mask nervousness or to manipulate the perception of trustworthiness. Conversely, the absence of gaze aversion, which is frequently assumed to reveal discomfort or deceit, does not categorically rule out dishonesty, as some individuals are adept at controlling their eye behavior under stress. Without additional cues or the broader context of the interaction, the meaning behind the gaze remains ambiguous, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive evaluation before drawing conclusions about the veracity of the subject’s statements.

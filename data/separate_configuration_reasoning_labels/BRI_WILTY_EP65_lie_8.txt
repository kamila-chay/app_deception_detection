The subject’s smile can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. A genuine smile might suggest comfort and honesty, signaling that the individual feels at ease and is sharing truthful information. Conversely, a smile can also serve as a strategic social tool to mask discomfort or to deflect suspicion, potentially indicating an attempt to appear trustworthy while concealing deception. Similarly, the action of raising eyebrows could be viewed as an expression of surprise or openness, reinforcing the credibility of what is being communicated. Yet, the same gesture might also be employed deliberately to exaggerate emotions or to manipulate the listener’s perception, thus casting doubt on the veracity of the message. The subject’s hands touching their head or body is another behavior that bears dual interpretations. On one hand, such gestures may reflect nervousness or self-soothing in response to the stress of fabricating information. On the other, these movements could simply be habitual or related to physical discomfort, unrelated to any intent to deceive. Without additional context and a broader behavioral baseline, it remains challenging to definitively classify these behaviors as indicators of truthfulness or deception, underscoring the need for a cautious and holistic evaluation.

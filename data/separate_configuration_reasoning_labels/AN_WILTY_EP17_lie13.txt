The subject’s gaze directed downward can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking down might suggest an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which is often associated with feelings of guilt, discomfort, or the desire to conceal the truth. This avoidance could indicate that the individual is fabricating information or hiding something. On the other hand, lowering one’s gaze can also be a natural reaction to processing complex thoughts, recalling information, or experiencing shyness or modesty. It might simply reflect an introspective moment or a cultural habit that does not relate to dishonesty. Without additional context about the individual's baseline behavior, emotional state, and the conversation’s content, the downward gaze alone provides an ambiguous signal that necessitates cautious interpretation.

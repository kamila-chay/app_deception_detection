The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor could suggest engagement and sincerity, as maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and honesty. However, this same behavior might also be a strategic effort to appear truthful, as some people consciously use eye contact to mask deception. Conversely, their moments of gazing downward might indicate discomfort or guilt, potentially signaling that they are withholding information or feeling uneasy about their statements. On the other hand, looking down can simply reflect introspection or shyness, which does not necessarily imply deception.

Their head tilting adds another layer of complexity. This gesture might denote openness and attentiveness, indicating a willingness to connect and be understood, characteristics often associated with truthful communication. Yet, head tilting can also be interpreted as a subtle attempt to feign empathy or soften the delivery of a potentially false narrative. Finally, the open positioning of their arms may reveal a relaxed and transparent demeanor, reinforcing the impression of honesty. Alternatively, such openness could be a calculated move to reduce suspicion and foster trust, especially if the person is skilled at controlling nonverbal cues.

Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated in the broader context of the interaction and accompanied by additional evidence to draw a well-founded conclusion about the person’s truthfulness or deception.

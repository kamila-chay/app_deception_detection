The individual’s behavior presents a complex picture that can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. Their mouth being closed with protruded lips might suggest a conscious effort to withhold information or control speech, potentially indicating deceit. Conversely, this mouth posture could simply reflect concentration or a neutral resting position, with the individual being fully engaged in the conversation without any intent to deceive. The downward movement of the chin may be a subtle sign of discomfort or submission, possibly linked to the stress of fabricating information, yet it could also be a natural response to the flow of dialogue or a sign of thoughtful reflection.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor demonstrates engagement and attentiveness, which generally supports sincerity. However, when combined with occasional upward glances, it might signal the mental effort involved in constructing a false narrative or attempting to recall memory, while alternatively, such gaze shifts could be completely normal cognitive behaviors related to thinking or processing questions. The presence of nodding gestures often serves as an affirming cue, which might suggest truthful affirmation of the conversation, but it can also be used strategically to feign agreement and build rapport when one is being deceptive.

Furthermore, the dynamic head movements—moving forward and backward, tilting, turning sideways, and holding the head up—can be equally ambivalent. Head moving forward may indicate engagement and eagerness to communicate honestly, yet it could also represent a subtle approach to convince or manipulate. Conversely, leaning the head backward may reflect distancing or discomfort associated with deception, or it could simply be a physical adjustment unrelated to the truthfulness of the dialogue. Similarly, head tilting and side-turning might express curiosity or openness, or alternatively, evasiveness and an attempt to avoid direct confrontation. The head held up position can signal confidence and honesty but, in some cases, it might be a defensive posture adopted to mask insecurity.

In sum, these behaviors should not be evaluated in isolation. Each gesture and movement carries potential dual meanings that depend heavily on the broader communicative context and individual baseline behavior. Without additional information about the person’s typical mannerisms and contextual cues, it is challenging to definitively attribute these behaviors to truthfulness or deception.

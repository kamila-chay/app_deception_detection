The subject’s frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or concern, potentially indicating they are carefully constructing a response or experiencing discomfort related to deception. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect genuine thoughtfulness or emotional engagement with the topic, rather than dishonesty. Their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor might be interpreted as an attempt to maintain control over the conversation, possibly to ensure their fabricated narrative is convincing. However, steady eye contact can also be a sign of confidence and sincerity, as many truthful individuals naturally seek connection through direct gaze. The occasional sideways glances present another layer of ambiguity; such glances could hint at evasiveness or internal conflict as they try to hide something. On the other hand, these glances may indicate efforts to recall information or momentarily process their thoughts, demonstrating normal cognitive functioning rather than deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the broader context of the interaction, as each could be indicative of either truthfulness or deception depending on situational factors and individual differences.

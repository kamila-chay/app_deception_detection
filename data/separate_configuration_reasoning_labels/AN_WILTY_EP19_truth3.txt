The subject’s tendency to gaze down could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. This behavior might suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which some consider a potential indicator of deception, as the individual may be trying to shield themselves while fabricating or withholding information. Conversely, looking down can also be a natural response to concentration or introspection, reflecting an effort to recall details accurately rather than an intent to deceive. It might also indicate shyness or respect in certain cultural contexts, rather than evasiveness. Without additional cues, interpreting gaze direction alone remains ambiguous, and understanding the subject’s baseline behavior and situational factors is essential to forming a balanced assessment.

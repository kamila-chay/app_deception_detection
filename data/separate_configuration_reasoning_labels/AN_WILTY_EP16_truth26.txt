The individual displays a smile with lip corners turned upwards, a gesture often associated with friendliness and openness. This could suggest genuine positive engagement and honesty, as a sincere smile typically reflects true emotions. Conversely, smiles can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or divert suspicion, potentially indicating a deliberate attempt to appear trustworthy while concealing deceit.

Their gaze alternates between looking towards the interlocutor and glancing downward. Maintaining eye contact might be interpreted as a sign of confidence and candidness, reflecting an authentic willingness to communicate openly. However, consistent or intense eye contact can sometimes be a conscious effort to convince or manipulate, serving as a tool to reinforce a fabricated narrative. On the other hand, looking downward could be perceived as a sign of discomfort or evasiveness, perhaps indicating hesitation or uncertainty related to deception. Yet, this same behavior might simply reflect momentary reflection, cultural norms, or a natural response while processing information, without any deceptive intent.

In sum, each of these behaviors—smiling, lip movement, and gaze direction—carries dual potential meanings depending on the broader context in which they occur. Determining truthfulness or deception requires a holistic view that incorporates situational factors, baseline behaviors, and the overall interaction dynamics rather than relying solely on isolated gestures.

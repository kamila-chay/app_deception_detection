The subject displays frowning eyebrows, which could suggest concentration and possible discomfort, potentially indicating the mental effort involved in fabricating information. Conversely, this expression might simply reflect genuine confusion or concern about the topic at hand, rather than deception. The raising of eyebrows can be interpreted as a sign of surprise or seeking reassurance, which might point to an attempt to gauge the interlocutor’s reactions while crafting a story. Alternatively, this same gesture could be a natural response to unexpected information or an honest expression of interest. Their lips are protruded, a behavior sometimes associated with uncertainty or hesitation, possibly hinting at underlying anxiety related to dishonesty. Yet, such lip movements can also arise from physical factors like concentration or habitual expression, making it difficult to assign definitive meaning. Regarding gaze, maintaining direct eye contact might suggest confidence and transparency, implying truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to compensate for deception. On the other hand, upward gaze may indicate an internal thought process or recall effort, which could mean the person is inventing details, but it might just as well reflect genuine memory retrieval. Ultimately, these behaviors must be considered within the broader context of the interaction and corroborated with additional cues before drawing conclusions about the subject’s veracity.

The person’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often suggests openness and confidence, which might indicate that they have nothing to hide and are being truthful. Maintaining such engagement can foster trust and signal sincerity. On the other hand, deliberate and prolonged eye contact can sometimes be a conscious strategy to mask deception, as the individual attempts to appear more credible and in control. Without additional cues, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether their gaze reflects honesty or a rehearsed effort to convince.

Similarly, their open arm posture presents a dual narrative. Open arms are frequently associated with approachability and transparency, implying that the person is receptive and comfortable in the conversation, which can be seen as a sign of truthfulness. However, this same gesture might also be employed deliberately to project confidence and deflect suspicion, especially if the individual is attempting to conceal dishonest intentions. Openness in body language does not inherently rule out deception; it may be part of a broader strategy to influence the interlocutor’s perception.

Ultimately, these behaviors—gaze towards the interlocutor and open arms—can both support and challenge assumptions about veracity. Contextual factors, such as the person’s baseline behavior, the nature of the conversation, and other verbal and nonverbal signals, are essential to forming a more accurate interpretation. Without such context, these cues remain ambiguous indicators that could point towards either truthfulness or deception.

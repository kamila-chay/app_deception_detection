The subject’s gaze toward the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often signals confidence and honesty, suggesting that the person is engaged and transparent in the conversation. Conversely, it may also be a deliberate attempt to appear truthful, as some individuals use direct eye contact to mask deceptive intentions. When their gaze shifts downward, it could indicate discomfort or an effort to avoid scrutiny, potentially pointing to evasion or internal conflict over fabricating information. However, looking down might equally reflect genuine contemplation or the processing of complex emotions, rather than deception. The posture of having their head held up can project confidence and openness, reinforcing sincerity; yet, it might also serve as a façade to conceal any underlying anxiety or dishonesty. Meanwhile, the subject’s arms held open can be seen as a sign of receptiveness and honesty, signaling that they have nothing to hide. Conversely, this openness might be a conscious or unconscious tactic to create a false sense of security in the listener. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues or baseline behavior for comparison, these behaviors each carry plausible interpretations that span both truthful and deceptive explanations.

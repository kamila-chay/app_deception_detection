The person is raising their eyebrows, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows may signal surprise or emphasis, potentially reflecting genuine engagement and openness in the conversation, suggesting truthfulness. On the other hand, this gesture might be employed as an exaggerated display to feign innocence or to distract from discomfort, possibly indicating deception. Accompanying this is a slight upward movement of the lip corners, a subtle smile that could denote sincerity and friendliness, reinforcing a truthful demeanor. Conversely, such a smile might be a carefully controlled expression aimed at masking unease or manipulating the interlocutor’s perception, raising suspicion about the veracity of their message.

Additionally, the lips appear retracted, which could be read as an involuntary physical response linked to tension or stress commonly associated with dishonesty. However, lip retraction can also simply be a neutral physiological reaction or a habitual expression unrelated to deception. Their gaze remains fixed toward the interlocutor, suggesting attentiveness and willingness to engage, traits often aligned with honesty. Yet, sustained direct eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate for deceit, attempting to build trust artificially.

Lastly, the head tilting observed may convey curiosity or openness, signaling an empathetic and authentic interaction. Alternately, it might function as a subtle cue designed to appear non-threatening or ingratiating, potentially concealing apprehension or falsehood. Without additional contextual information—such as the subject's baseline behaviors, the conversational environment, and verbal content—it remains challenging to definitively interpret these cues as indicators of truthfulness or deception.

The subject’s gaze behavior presents a complex picture with potential implications in both directions. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest confidence and openness, characteristics often associated with truthful communication. Maintaining eye contact can also be interpreted as a way to establish trust and demonstrate sincerity. Conversely, such focused gaze may be a deliberate effort to appear convincing or to control the interaction, potentially masking deception. On the other hand, the moments when the subject looks down could indicate discomfort or hesitation, which might be signs of evasion or internal conflict linked to deceit. However, looking downward can also reflect natural cognitive processes like recalling information, managing emotions, or even cultural communication styles without any deceptive intent. Without additional context, these behaviors alone do not definitively reveal truthfulness or deceit, and should be considered alongside other verbal and nonverbal cues for a more nuanced understanding.

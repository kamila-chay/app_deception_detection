The subject's scowl might be interpreted as a sign of frustration or discomfort, potentially suggesting they are grappling with the stress of fabricating a story or concealing information. Conversely, the scowl could simply reflect concentration or a reaction to an external stimulus unrelated to deception. Their raised eyebrows could indicate surprise or uncertainty, which some might associate with hesitance typically observed during deception. Alternatively, this same expression could convey genuine surprise or engagement in the conversation, reflecting openness rather than deceit.

The subtle upward turn of the lip corners presents an interesting duality: it might be an attempt to mask true emotions by feigning warmth or friendliness, a tactic sometimes employed by those who wish to appear sincere despite deceit. However, this expression could also be a natural smile resulting from genuine positive feelings or rapport with the interlocutor. Maintaining direct gaze often signals confidence and honesty, potentially reinforcing perceptions of truthfulness. On the other hand, deliberate eye contact can also be a conscious strategy used to persuade or deflect suspicion, especially if it appears overly intense or rehearsed.

The open palms and arms extended outward can be read as gestures of openness and honesty, suggesting a willingness to communicate transparently. Alternatively, these same gestures can be performed intentionally to simulate sincerity and engender trust, thereby serving as possible indicators of manipulation. Ultimately, each behavior carries plausible interpretations that can vary widely depending on the broader context, making it essential to consider additional verbal and situational cues before drawing definitive conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

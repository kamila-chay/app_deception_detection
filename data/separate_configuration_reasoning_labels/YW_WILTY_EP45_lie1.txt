The subject’s behaviors, such as raising their eyebrows, can be interpreted in multiple ways. Raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and engagement in the conversation, suggesting openness. Conversely, it could also be a subtle cue of discomfort or an exaggerated reaction aimed at masking uncertainty or deceit. Their frequent blinking might indicate heightened cognitive load or stress associated with fabricating information, yet it also may simply reflect a natural physiological response to anxiety or eye irritation, unrelated to deception.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor is often associated with sincerity and confidence, implying a truthful exchange. However, sustained eye contact can also be deliberately maintained to persuade or manipulate, serving as a strategy to appear credible while being deceptive. On the other hand, moments of gaze directed downward could point to feelings of shame or guilty awareness, potentially hinting at deceit. Alternatively, such gaze aversion might simply reflect cultural norms, discomfort, or efforts to concentrate and recall details.

Head tilting is another behavior that can be read in divergent ways. It might convey empathy, openness, or sincere interest in the dialogue, reinforcing a truthful stance. Yet, subtle head tilting can also be employed to disguise discomfort or signal uncertainty in the narrative being presented. Considering these behaviors collectively, each carries plausible interpretations that both support and challenge the assumption of truthfulness. Therefore, only by integrating additional contextual information and baseline behavioral patterns can a more definitive conclusion about possible deception be drawn.

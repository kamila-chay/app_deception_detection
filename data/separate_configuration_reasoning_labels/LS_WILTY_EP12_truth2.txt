The subject’s mouth is closed, which could suggest a deliberate attempt to control their speech, potentially indicating hesitation or caution that some might associate with deceptive behavior. Conversely, a closed mouth might simply reflect a neutral listening posture or an effort to formulate thoughts carefully, without any intent to deceive. Their lips are retracted, which might be interpreted as a subtle expression of discomfort or tension, possibly linked to the stress of fabricating information. However, lip retraction can also be a natural facial expression unrelated to deceit, perhaps resulting from concentration or emotional reaction to the conversation’s content. The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor might imply a genuine engagement and willingness to communicate openly, supporting the notion of truthfulness. In contrast, maintaining eye contact could also be a conscious strategy to appear credible and deter suspicion, a common tactic used by those attempting to convince others while concealing the truth. Additionally, the momentary gaze shifting upward could indicate the subject is accessing memories or visualizing scenarios to provide accurate information. On the other hand, looking upward might be a sign of fabrication, as some psychological theories suggest that constructing falsehoods involves different cognitive pathways than recalling facts. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of contextual factors and baseline behavior, as each cue has valid but opposing interpretations in the realm of deception detection.

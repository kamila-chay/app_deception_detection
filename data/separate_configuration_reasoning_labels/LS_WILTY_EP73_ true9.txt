The subject is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and truthfulness in their communication. Conversely, it might also be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or exaggerate emotion in order to manipulate the listener, which could indicate deception.

Their frequent blinking similarly carries ambiguous meaning. Increased blinking can be a physiological response to stress or cognitive load, potentially reflecting discomfort associated with fabricating information. On the other hand, frequent blinking might simply be a natural reaction to environmental factors like lighting or dry eyes, or even a habitual behavior without any link to dishonesty.

Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor is another behavior that allows for dual interpretation. Consistent eye contact is often regarded as a sign of confidence and honesty, as individuals who tell the truth may feel less need to avoid the gaze of others. However, some individuals deliberately maintain strong eye contact to convince their audience or mask internal unease, which might be a tactic employed by someone attempting to deceive.

Ultimately, while these behaviors provide intriguing cues, they cannot be conclusively interpreted without considering the broader context, such as the subject’s baseline behaviors and the content of their responses. Additional information would be essential to draw a more reliable conclusion about their veracity.

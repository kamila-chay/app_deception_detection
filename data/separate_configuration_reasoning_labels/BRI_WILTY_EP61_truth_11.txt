The individual’s act of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or disbelief, which could be a genuine emotional response aligning with truthful behavior. It might also indicate openness or an attempt to appear more sincere and engaged during the interaction, which supports the possibility of honesty. On the other hand, eyebrow raising can sometimes be a deliberate gesture intended to feign innocence or emphasize a point, potentially serving as a subtle cue to manipulate the listener’s perception and deflect suspicion. This behavior might also be an unconscious anxiety-related reaction, signaling internal discomfort associated with deception. Without additional contextual information, such as the timing of the gesture relative to verbal statements or other nonverbal cues, it remains ambiguous whether the raised eyebrows point toward truthfulness or deceit.

The individual’s smile and the subtle raising of their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when evaluating potential deception. On one hand, these expressions might signify genuine warmth and openness, suggesting truthfulness and an attempt to establish rapport. Conversely, such behaviors could be employed strategically to mask discomfort or to appear more credible during a deceptive account, as people often use smiles to deflect suspicion. The upward movement of the lip corners similarly supports this dual interpretation: it may reflect authentic positive emotion or alternatively act as a controlled gesture designed to convey sincerity artificially.

Their gaze patterns also open room for dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor often indicates engagement and honesty, reflecting a direct communication style. However, this same behavior could be a conscious effort to convince or manipulate, with deceptive individuals deliberately holding gaze to appear more trustworthy. On the other hand, the moments when the gaze shifts downward can suggest discomfort or internal conflict, traits sometimes linked with deception. Yet looking away or down may simply denote cognitive processing or self-reflection, as people often avert their gaze when searching for accurate memories or formulating responses.

Lastly, the head tilting behavior offers similar ambiguity. Tilting the head can be a sign of empathy and genuine interest, enhancing interpersonal connection and signaling openness. Alternately, it could be a calculated nonverbal cue meant to evoke trust or minimize doubt, thereby assisting in an attempt to conceal dishonesty. Without additional context or corroborating behavioral patterns, these gestures and expressions alone make it difficult to conclusively determine whether the individual is being truthful or deceptive. Careful consideration of the broader communicative context is essential before drawing firm conclusions.

The subject’s frowning eyebrows might suggest a degree of discomfort or concentration that could be associated with attempts to deceive, as the act of fabricating information often requires significant cognitive effort and emotional management. Conversely, such a facial expression could simply reflect genuine concern, confusion, or deep thought related to the conversation at hand, rather than any intent to mislead. Their sustained gaze towards the interlocutor might be interpreted in two contrasting ways as well. On one hand, maintaining eye contact could be a deliberate effort to establish trustworthiness and convince the listener of their sincerity, which some deceptive individuals employ to mask their true intentions. On the other hand, steady eye contact may indicate engagement and honesty, signaling openness and a willingness to communicate transparently. Ultimately, these behaviors, while informative, are ambiguous on their own, and a thorough understanding of the broader context and physiology is necessary before arriving at a definitive conclusion regarding the subject’s truthfulness.

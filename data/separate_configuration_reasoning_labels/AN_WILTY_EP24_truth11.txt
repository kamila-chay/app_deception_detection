The subject’s smile and the lifting of the lip corners might be interpreted as signs of genuine friendliness and openness, suggesting they are comfortable and truthful in the interaction. However, these same behaviors could also be consciously employed to mask discomfort or deflect suspicion, serving as a strategic display to create an impression of sincerity. Their gaze towards the interlocutor can be viewed as a sign of engagement and confidence, reinforcing the perception of honesty and openness in the exchange. Alternatively, sustained eye contact might be an intentional effort to assert control or persuasion, potentially indicating a rehearsed narrative rather than spontaneous truthfulness. Conversely, the moments when the subject directs their gaze downward could signal moments of reflection or modesty, which often accompany truthful responses. Yet, such downward glances might also be interpreted as avoidance behaviors, possibly reflecting internal conflict or an attempt to shield oneself from scrutiny when fabricating details. Finally, the subject’s head held up may demonstrate confidence and assertiveness, traits commonly associated with honesty and transparency. On the other hand, this posture might be consciously maintained to project composure and mask any hidden discomfort, adding to a calculated effort to appear credible. Taken together, these behaviors paint a complex picture where each element carries dual interpretations, underscoring the necessity of broader contextual information to more confidently assess the subject’s truthfulness.

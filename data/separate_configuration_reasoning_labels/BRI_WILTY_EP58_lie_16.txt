The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest sincerity and confidence, as they are openly engaging without avoiding attention. Conversely, it could also indicate a conscious effort to appear truthful, as some individuals deliberately hold eye contact to mask dishonesty. The act of head tilting similarly offers ambiguous insights; it might signal curiosity, openness, and attentiveness, which commonly accompany truthful communication. Yet, the same gesture could be a calculated move to appear empathetic or thoughtful, potentially diverting suspicion when telling a falsehood. The subject’s head shaking further complicates the interpretation. This gesture often implies disagreement or denial, which might be genuine if the person is disputing an incorrect assumption. On the flip side, repeated head shaking can be a subtle attempt to reinforce a false statement, emphasizing rejection of an uncomfortable truth. Ultimately, the true meaning behind these behaviors hinges on the broader context of the interaction and the consistency of verbal and non-verbal cues, requiring caution before drawing conclusions about deception.

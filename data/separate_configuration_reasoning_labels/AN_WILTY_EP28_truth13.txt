The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor may suggest engagement and honesty, indicating that they are confident and forthcoming in the conversation. However, this same direct gaze can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to feign sincerity and mask underlying deceit. Meanwhile, their occasional sideways glances could be interpreted as signs of evasiveness or an attempt to escape scrutiny, potentially pointing to discomfort with the truth. Conversely, such gaze aversions might simply reflect cognitive processing or an effort to recall information accurately, rather than concealment.

The subtle side-turn of the head could be a nonverbal cue signaling doubt or resistance to the topic at hand, which might raise suspicion about their veracity. On the other hand, it may be a natural, relaxed posture that helps them think, without any deceptive intent. Similarly, the act of shaking the head may be read as a nonverbal denial or disagreement, possibly hinting at defensive behavior associated with dishonesty. Yet, it could also be a straightforward expression of genuine disagreement or an attempt to clarify their stance.

Their open arm positioning tends to convey openness and receptiveness, qualities generally aligned with truthful communication. However, this same openness might be consciously exhibited to appear approachable and trustworthy, potentially serving as a compensatory gesture to divert suspicion. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader conversational context and baseline habits to discern whether they signal truthfulness or deception.

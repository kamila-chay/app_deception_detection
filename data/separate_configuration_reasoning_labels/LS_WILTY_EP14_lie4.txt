The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners can be interpreted in two distinct ways. On one hand, these expressions may signal genuine positive emotion and openness, suggesting sincerity and comfort in the interaction. On the other hand, they could be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to create a façade of friendliness, potentially indicating an attempt to deceive or manipulate the perception of honesty.

The raised eyebrows also present a dual interpretation. This gesture might reflect surprise, attentiveness, or an earnest effort to engage genuinely with the interlocutor. Conversely, raising the eyebrows can sometimes be an exaggerated expression used to emphasize a point or feign innocence, thereby serving as a subtle cue for deception.

Exaggerated eye closing adds another layer of complexity. It may be a natural response to emotional stimuli or fatigue, implying authenticity in emotional expression. Alternatively, it could be an intentional attempt to shield the eyes momentarily, possibly as a way to avoid direct eye contact during moments of fabrication.

Their gaze shifts offer further nuanced insights. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor can be a sign of honesty and confidence, reflecting openness and willingness to communicate truthfully. Yet, persistent eye contact might also be consciously maintained to convince or control the interlocutor, masking underlying deceit. When the gaze drops downward, it may indicate reflection, uncertainty, or modesty, consistent with honest processing or recalling information. In contrast, a downward gaze could also signal discomfort or an internal attempt to avoid scrutiny, suggesting possible concealment.

The side-turn of the head and the head shaking contribute additional ambiguity. A gentle head turn may be a natural gesture used to process information or add emphasis in a genuine manner. Alternatively, it could serve as a distancing strategy, a nonverbal cue to create psychological space when fabricating or hiding something. Similarly, head shaking typically denotes disagreement or doubt, but this gesture might genuinely reflect honest negation or could be exaggerated to emphasize false denial.

Given the interplay of these behaviors, each action on its own could support interpretations of both truthfulness and deception. To draw a more reliable conclusion, it would be essential to consider the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors.

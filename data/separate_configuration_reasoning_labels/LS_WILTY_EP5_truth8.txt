The subject’s smile could suggest warmth and sincerity, indicating they are being truthful and comfortable in the interaction. Conversely, such a smile might be a mask designed to conceal discomfort or deceit, employed deliberately to project friendliness while hiding true intentions. Their simultaneous scowl and frowning eyebrows might reflect genuine confusion or concern, signaling engagement with a difficult topic, but alternatively, these expressions could be signs of internal conflict or a subconscious reaction to fabricating information. Frequent blinking is often associated with nervousness, which may support the idea of deception, yet it can also be a normal physiological response to stress or simply a habit without any deceitful connotation. Exaggerated eye closing could be interpreted as an attempt to momentarily block out external stimuli to formulate a lie, but it may also just indicate fatigue or a natural way of processing thoughts. The downward and sideways gazes could be seen as evasive behaviors, traditionally linked to dishonesty, or, from another perspective, they might indicate contemplation or the search for accurate memories. The gaze maintained toward the interlocutor might display confidence and openness, reinforcing truthfulness, but this could also be a strategic effort to overcompensate and convince the listener. Finally, the head side-turn could be interpreted as a subtle sign of discomfort or distancing associated with deceit, or simply a comfortable posture or a nonverbal cue reflecting curiosity or uncertainty. Without further contextual information about the interaction and the individual’s baseline behavior, it remains challenging to definitively classify these behaviors as indicators of truthfulness or deception.

The individual’s smile may initially suggest openness and friendliness, potentially indicating honesty and comfort in the interaction. However, smiles can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to manipulate impressions, thus possibly serving as a tool to conceal deceptive intent. Their chin moving upwards can be interpreted as a gesture of confidence and assertiveness, traits often associated with truthfulness. Conversely, such a posture might be an attempt to project control or dominance in the conversation, which could arise from a need to defend a fabricated narrative.

The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor typically signals engagement and sincerity, as direct eye contact tends to foster trustworthiness. Yet, sustained or intense eye contact could also be an effort to convince the other party despite underlying dishonesty, reflecting a conscious effort to appear credible. The occasional shift of gaze downward might indicate moments of introspection or the cognitive processing involved in recalling truthful memories. On the other hand, looking down can be a classic sign of discomfort or evasiveness, potentially indicating attempts to avoid scrutiny when fabricating information.

Lastly, the act of holding the head up might be a sign of self-assurance and openness, aligning with truthful communication. Alternatively, it could also suggest a deliberate posture to assert confidence artificially, masking uncertainty beneath the surface. Given these behaviors, it is important to consider the broader context and additional cues to arrive at a more substantiated understanding of the individual’s truthfulness or possible deception.

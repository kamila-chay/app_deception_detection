The subject’s smile, characterized by the upward movement of the lip corners, could be interpreted as a genuine display of warmth and engagement, signaling truthfulness and comfort in the interaction. Conversely, such a smile might be a carefully controlled social mask designed to mask underlying discomfort or to feign friendliness, which can be a tactic often employed in deceptive behavior. The upward movement of the chin might further reinforce confidence and honesty, suggesting openness; however, this same gesture could also serve as a subtle attempt to assert dominance or deflect scrutiny, possibly indicating a defensive posture commonly associated with dishonesty.

Their gaze downward may be seen as a moment of introspection or evocation of truthful memories, reflecting thoughtfulness and sincerity. Yet, alternatively, a downward gaze can sometimes indicate avoidance or discomfort, potentially signaling an attempt to hide something or evade direct engagement. Similarly, sideways glances could be interpreted as the person trying to thoughtfully process information or recall details accurately, which aligns with truthful behavior. On the other hand, these glances could also suggest evasiveness or the mental effort involved in fabricating a story, which might hint at deception.

The backward movement of the head might denote a relaxed state, signaling that the individual feels at ease and confident in their statements. On the flip side, it might be a subtle distancing mechanism, indicating discomfort or an unconscious effort to put psychological space between themselves and the topic, which can raise some suspicion. The head’s side-turn could further emphasize openness and active listening in one light, suggesting genuine engagement with the conversation. Yet, it could also be a tactical maneuver to avoid direct confrontation or eye contact, often linked with deceptive intentions.

In sum, these behaviours each carry dual potential meanings, and their interpretation depends heavily on the broader context, including baseline behavior, situational factors, and verbal content. Without that additional information, it is prudent to remain neutral, acknowledging that these actions could just as plausibly be signs of truthful communication as they could be indicators of deception.

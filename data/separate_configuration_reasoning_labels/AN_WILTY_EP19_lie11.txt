The subject’s raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating an attempt to strengthen their message and appear convincing. Conversely, raised eyebrows might be a natural reaction or a sign of doubt, reflecting uncertainty rather than deception. Their chin moving upwards might be interpreted as a subtle display of confidence or dominance, possibly meant to assert credibility. However, this same gesture could also signal defensiveness or discomfort, hinting at an underlying attempt to mask insecurity or falsehood. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor is often seen as a sign of honesty and engagement, but it can equally be a deliberate effort to establish trust while concealing deceit. Similarly, leaning the head forward might demonstrate attentiveness and openness, yet it could just as well be a tactic to appear sincere and earnest when fabricating information. Lastly, crossing fingers traditionally symbolizes a hidden promise or a wish for luck, which might indicate the person is being dishonest. On the other hand, this gesture could be a benign habit or a sign of self-soothing in a stressful conversation, unrelated to deception. Overall, these behaviors should be interpreted within a broader context, as each one carries plausible interpretations supporting both truthfulness and deception.

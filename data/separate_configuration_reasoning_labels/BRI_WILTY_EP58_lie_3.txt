The individual’s gaze behavior alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways, which presents an interesting dynamic in assessing their truthfulness. Direct eye contact can be interpreted as a sign of confidence and honesty, suggesting they are open and engaged in the conversation. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate attempt to feign sincerity and maintain control over the interaction. Meanwhile, the sideways glances might indicate discomfort or an effort to avoid scrutiny, potentially signaling evasiveness or fabricated information. On the other hand, such glances could simply reflect cognitive processing as they try to access memories or formulate thoughtful responses.

Their head movements, involving both tilting and turning to the side, add further nuance to the interpretation. Head tilting is often seen as a sign of curiosity or openness, which may support the idea that they are genuinely interested and truthful. Yet, this same behavior can be a subtle cue of uncertainty or an unconscious attempt to distance themselves from what is being said, hinting at possible deception. Similarly, turning the head to the side might be interpreted as an avoidance gesture, suggesting discomfort or reluctance to fully confront a topic. Alternatively, it could just be a natural, relaxed posture or a way of expressing empathy and attentiveness.

Ultimately, while these visible behaviors offer clues, each action can be construed in multiple ways depending on the broader context, the individual’s baseline behavior, and the nature of the interaction. Drawing reliable conclusions about their truthfulness or deception would require integrating these observations with additional information and situational factors.

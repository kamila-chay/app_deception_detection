The subject’s head tilting might be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, this gesture can signify curiosity or active engagement, suggesting they are genuinely interested in the conversation and open to sharing truthful information. Conversely, head tilting might also be seen as a subtle attempt to appear more empathetic or inviting, potentially masking evasiveness or dishonesty. Similarly, the display of palms up is often associated with openness and sincerity, which could indicate that the person is being forthright and transparent. However, this same gesture can also be consciously employed to foster trust and disarm skepticism, thus serving as a strategic cue to deflect suspicion when someone is trying to deceive. Without considering the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors, it remains challenging to definitively interpret these actions as either truthful or deceptive.

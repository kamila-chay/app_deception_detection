The person’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity in their statements, which often accompanies truthful communication. Alternatively, raised eyebrows can sometimes signal uncertainty or disbelief in one’s own narrative, possibly pointing to deception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor similarly carries a dual meaning. Maintaining eye contact is frequently seen as a sign of confidence and honesty, yet in certain cases, it may be deliberately maintained to mask deceit or to control the impression given to the listener.

Conversely, the occasional sideways glance introduces another layer of complexity. Such gaze shifts may reflect genuine cognitive processes, like searching memory for accurate details, suggesting honesty. However, they can also be interpreted as signs of discomfort or evasiveness, potentially indicative of someone constructing or hiding part of their story. Nodding, often seen as an affirmation of agreement or engagement, could reinforce the perception of truthfulness and rapport building. Yet, it might also be a strategic behavior to encourage the interlocutor, deflect suspicion, or give the impression of openness while concealing true intentions.

Given these varied possibilities, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors. Without additional information, these cues remain ambiguous and equally supportive of both truthful and deceptive interpretations.

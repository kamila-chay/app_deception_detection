The individual’s smile might be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, a smile can serve as a genuine expression of friendliness and openness, suggesting comfort and honesty in the interaction. Conversely, it could also be a strategic social cue designed to mask discomfort or to feign sincerity, especially if it appears forced or incongruent with other emotional cues. Their raised eyebrows further complicate the interpretation; this gesture might indicate surprise or engagement, reflecting genuine interest and truthful communication. Alternatively, raised eyebrows can sometimes signal incredulity or attempt to enhance the believability of a statement, potentially hinting at underlying deceit.

The subject’s gaze patterns also offer mixed signals. Directly looking at the interlocutor could demonstrate confidence and a willingness to connect truthfully, reinforcing the credibility of their statements. However, sustained eye contact can also be consciously maintained to persuade or manipulate, serving as a deliberate tactic to convince the listener. Contrarily, moments when the person looks downward might suggest discomfort or evasion, which could be interpreted as signs of deception or internal conflict. On the other hand, gaze aversion might simply be a natural response to processing information or recalling memories, not necessarily indicative of dishonesty.

Lastly, the subtle head tilting carries dual connotations. It might express curiosity, empathy, and attentiveness—hallmarks of genuine social interaction that align with honest behavior. Yet, head tilting could also be a calculated move to appear more approachable or to distract from incongruences in the narrative, revealing a possible attempt to influence perception. Without broader contextual cues, these behaviors remain ambiguous, emphasizing the importance of considering the full scope of interaction rather than isolating individual gestures when evaluating truthfulness.

The individual’s smile can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. A genuine smile might indicate comfort and sincerity, suggesting that the person is being truthful. Conversely, if the smile appears forced or inconsistent with the emotional content of the conversation, it could signal an attempt to mask discomfort or deceit. Similarly, raising eyebrows may reflect surprise or engagement, which often accompanies honest communication. However, exaggerated or repeated eyebrow raises might also be employed as a social cue to distract or manipulate the interlocutor. The direct gaze toward the other person typically signifies openness and confidence, traits commonly associated with truthful exchanges. On the other hand, sustained eye contact may be consciously maintained to convince or persuade, even when the speaker is not being entirely forthright. The occasional sideways gaze adds another layer of complexity—it might suggest momentary reflection or the cognitive process of retrieving memories, supporting the notion of honesty. Alternatively, looking away could reveal discomfort or evasiveness, behaviors frequently linked to deception. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors depends heavily on the broader context and baseline patterns of the individual, underscoring the importance of a holistic assessment rather than relying on isolated cues.

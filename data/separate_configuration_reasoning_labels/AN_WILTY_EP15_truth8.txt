Their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining direct eye contact might suggest honesty and confidence, as truthful individuals often feel comfortable engaging openly. It may reflect their intent to connect sincerely and convey transparency. Conversely, deliberate or prolonged eye contact can sometimes be employed as a strategy to compensate for underlying dishonesty, with the individual attempting to appear convincing or to mask nervousness. Such behavior might be driven by a conscious effort to control the impression they give, rather than an indication of truthfulness. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine whether this gaze pattern stems from genuine openness or a tactical choice, emphasizing the need to consider broader behavioral cues and situational factors before drawing conclusions.

The person’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of deception detection. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or incredulity, potentially indicating that they are trying to process a question carefully or conceal discomfort that stems from fabricating information. Conversely, this expression could also simply reflect genuine engagement or a natural reaction to the interaction, without any deceptive intent. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor generally suggests attentiveness and openness, which could point to truthful communication. However, maintaining eye contact might also be a conscious effort to appear sincere while masking dishonesty, as some individuals are aware that steady gaze is perceived as a sign of truthfulness. Meanwhile, their occasional sideways glances invite further nuanced interpretation; such glances might reveal attempts to avoid direct eye contact due to anxiety about deception, or alternatively, they could represent the individual searching for memories or information in a natural recall process. Similarly, the subtle head side-turn presents ambivalence—it might indicate discomfort or evasiveness associated with deceit, but it could equally be a benign physical adjustment or expression of reflective thought. Ultimately, these behaviors need to be contextualized within the broader interaction and the individual’s baseline mannerisms before drawing conclusions about their truthfulness or deception.

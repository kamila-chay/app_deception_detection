The individual maintains direct gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, sustained eye contact might reflect confidence and sincerity, suggesting they have nothing to hide and are comfortable sharing accurate information. Conversely, intense or prolonged gaze could also be a deliberate tactic to establish trust or distract from deceit, potentially indicating an attempt to manipulate the listener’s perception. Meanwhile, their arms are folded, a posture that similarly carries ambiguous implications. This closed-off body language might suggest defensiveness or discomfort, possibly signaling an internal effort to shield themselves from scrutiny or conceal falsehoods. Alternatively, folded arms could simply be a habitual or self-soothing gesture, reflecting neutrality or even a relaxed stance rather than resistance or deception. Ultimately, these behaviors must be contextualized within the broader interaction, as their significance can shift dramatically depending on factors such as the individual’s baseline behavior, cultural norms, and the conversational environment. Without additional cues or background, it remains equally plausible that these signals either support or undermine the presumption of truthfulness.

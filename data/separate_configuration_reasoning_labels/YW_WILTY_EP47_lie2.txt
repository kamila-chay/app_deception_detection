The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor could suggest engagement and honesty, as maintaining eye contact often signals openness and confidence. Conversely, it might also be a conscious effort to appear truthful, as some individuals deliberately hold eye contact to mask deceptive intentions. Their head shaking might indicate disagreement or denial, reinforcing the impression that they are being truthful in rejecting a claim. However, it could also be a practiced gesture aimed at convincing the listener of their honesty, even when they might be fabricating information. The palms-up gesture typically conveys openness and sincerity, implying that the person has nothing to hide. On the other hand, this same behavior can be employed strategically to feign vulnerability or innocence, thereby deflecting suspicion. Finally, arms held open could suggest a relaxed and transparent demeanor, consistent with truthful communication. Yet, this posture might also be part of a calculated display to seem non-threatening and cooperative, potentially concealing underlying deceit. Without additional context, each behavior could just as easily support interpretations of both honesty and deception, highlighting the importance of considering the bigger picture before reaching a conclusion.

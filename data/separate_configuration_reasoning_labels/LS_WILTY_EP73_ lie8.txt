The subject’s raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially indicating truthfulness. Conversely, eyebrow raising might also serve as a subtle cue to feign innocence or mask discomfort associated with deception. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor can be interpreted as a sign of engagement and openness, often linked to honest communication. However, sustained eye contact might equally be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate, especially if it seems overly intense or rehearsed. The moments when the gaze shifts downward might reflect genuine contemplation or humility, supporting the possibility of truthful reflection. Yet, such downward glances could also signal avoidance or internal conflict, which are sometimes associated with concealing information. Similarly, the head tilting may convey empathy and active listening, reinforcing a sense of authenticity. On the other hand, head tilting might also be employed as a strategic comportment to appear more trustworthy or disarm suspicion. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of additional contextual cues before forming a judgment about the subject’s truthfulness or deception.

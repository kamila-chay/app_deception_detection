The subject’s mouth remains closed throughout the interaction, which can be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, a closed mouth might indicate restraint or hesitation, possibly suggesting they are withholding information or carefully crafting their response. On the other hand, it might simply reflect a composed and thoughtful demeanor, indicating they are carefully considering their words before speaking and are truthful. The subtle upward movement of the lip corners presents an interesting duality: it could signify a genuine, controlled smile reflecting confidence and ease, or it might be a masked expression, a polite or rehearsed smile used to conceal discomfort or deception. The movements of the chin, alternating between upward and downward positions, also offer contrasting interpretations. Raising the chin may convey self-assurance or an attempt to assert credibility, potentially signaling honesty. Conversely, it could also be a defensive gesture, a subtle form of distancing oneself from the interlocutor, which sometimes occurs when someone is fabricating or feeling uneasy. Similarly, the downward movement of the chin might indicate submission or introspection, possibly consistent with truthful reflection, but it can also reveal insecurity or a desire to hide one’s emotions, which might be relevant in deceptive contexts.

Their gaze behavior further complicates the interpretation. Looking directly towards the interlocutor could suggest openness and engagement, hallmarks of honest communication. However, sustained eye contact might also be a strategic effort to appear sincere while fabricating information. In contrast, glancing downwards could be perceived as avoidance, a common sign of discomfort or evasion linked to deception. Yet, looking down might equally indicate thoughtfulness or the search for recall, rather than dishonesty. Given these contrasting possibilities, it is crucial to consider the broader context and additional cues beyond these isolated behaviors to arrive at a more informed assessment of the subject’s truthfulness.

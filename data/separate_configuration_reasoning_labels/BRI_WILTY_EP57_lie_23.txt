The subject exhibits a range of facial and gaze behaviors that could be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. Their frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which in some cases could be linked to the cognitive effort of fabricating information. Alternatively, this expression could simply reflect genuine concern or confusion related to the topic at hand, rather than deception. The act of raising their eyebrows might indicate surprise or emphasis, potentially signaling an attempt to persuade or emphasize honesty. Conversely, it could be a subtle sign of feigned astonishment, often employed to reinforce a fabricated narrative.

Their gaze shifts between direct engagement with the interlocutor, looking down, and glancing sideways. Maintaining eye contact can be a sign of openness and sincerity, yet it may also be deliberately sustained to mask dishonesty. Conversely, looking down might be interpreted as an aversion linked to guilt or concealment, but it can also be a natural response to processing difficult information or reflecting on something emotional. Sideways glances similarly carry ambiguity; they might reveal evasiveness or internal conflict associated with deception, or simply indicate distraction or momentary thought retrieval.

The subject’s head tilting can imply openness and attentiveness, which aligns with sincere communication. On the other hand, it might be a self-soothing gesture intended to obscure discomfort or deception. Taken together, these behaviors do not conclusively point to either truthfulness or falsehood on their own. Interpreting these subtle signals accurately requires a broader understanding of the context, baseline behavior of the individual, and any situational factors that could influence such expressions.

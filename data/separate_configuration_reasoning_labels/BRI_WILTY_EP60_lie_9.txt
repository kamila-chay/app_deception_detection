The individual’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact could signify confidence and honesty, suggesting that they are comfortable with the information they are sharing and have no reason to avoid direct engagement. Conversely, sustained eye contact might also be a deliberate tactic to convey sincerity, potentially masking underlying deception by attempting to convince the listener through apparent openness. Similarly, their hands rubbing could signal nervousness or discomfort, which some might associate with the stress of fabricating or withholding information. However, this gesture may simply reflect a habitual or self-soothing behavior unrelated to dishonesty, such as coping with general anxiety or coldness. Ultimately, without additional context or behavioral cues, these actions alone do not conclusively indicate truthfulness or deception, emphasizing the need for a holistic assessment to draw more definitive conclusions.

The individual is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can signal surprise or emphasis, potentially suggesting an attempt to add credibility or draw attention to their statements. However, this same expression could simply reflect genuine surprise or engagement in the conversation, without any intent to deceive. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which might indicate openness and willingness to communicate honestly. Conversely, this direct eye contact could be consciously maintained to mask deceptive intentions, as some people overcompensate by staring to appear truthful. At moments, their gaze shifts upward, a behavior often associated with accessing memories or constructing information, which might imply fabrication or retrieval of fabricated details. On the other hand, this could also be a natural cognitive process while recalling truthful information, meaning the upward gaze is not inherently suspicious. Similarly, when the individual looks down, it might be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or guilt linked to deception. Yet, looking downward can also indicate thoughtfulness or processing emotions honestly, without any deceptive undertone. Lastly, their head turns to the side, which may be a subtle attempt to disengage or avoid direct confrontation when fabricating a story. Conversely, it could simply be a momentary shift in attention or a nonverbal cue associated with reflective thinking. Without additional context, these behaviors remain open to multiple interpretations, underscoring the need for a holistic analysis before drawing conclusions about their truthfulness.

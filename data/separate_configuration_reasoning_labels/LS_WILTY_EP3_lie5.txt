The individual’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest discomfort or stress, potentially indicating they are grappling with the tension of concealing or fabricating information. Conversely, the frown could simply reflect genuine concern or concentration related to the topic discussed, without any deceptive intent. Similarly, their act of raising eyebrows can be seen as a signal of surprise or skepticism, which might support the idea that they are constructing a narrative in real-time. However, raised eyebrows often convey engagement or curiosity, which would align more with truthful and attentive communication.

Their closed mouth might further complicate interpretation. It could signify an attempt to withhold information or suppress emotions linked to dishonesty. Alternatively, a pursed or closed mouth might just be a neutral or habitual expression unconnected to deceit. The shifts in gaze present equally ambiguous cues. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor often indicates honesty and openness, fostering trust. Yet, in some cases, maintain ing eye contact deliberately can be part of a conscious effort to appear truthful while hiding something. The moments when the individual looks down can be a classic marker of discomfort or evasion, often associated with deceptive behavior. However, this downward gaze might simply be a result of introspection, recollection, or cultural norms around conversation.

Finally, the side-turn of the head might imply avoidance or guardedness, which could point toward deception. On the other hand, such a gesture might be related to nonverbal communication style, signaling thoughtfulness or an attempt to better hear or process information. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors depends heavily on the broader context, including the person’s baseline behavior, the nature of the conversation, and situational factors. Without this deeper insight, it remains equally plausible that the person is being either truthful or deceptive.

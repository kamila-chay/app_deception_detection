The subject’s gaze directed upward can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking upward might indicate that they are accessing visual memories or constructing a story, which could suggest that they are fabricating information. Alternatively, this same behavior might simply reflect a natural cognitive process, such as recalling facts or engaging in thoughtful reflection, which does not necessarily imply dishonesty. Similarly, the posture of folded arms can give rise to contrasting interpretations. It might signal defensiveness or a subconscious barrier, potentially revealing discomfort or resistance associated with deceit. Conversely, folded arms could also be a comfortable or habitual stance, reflecting nothing more than the subject’s normal body language or a way to maintain warmth or composure. Without additional context or corroborating cues, these behaviors remain ambiguous, highlighting the need for cautious and comprehensive analysis before drawing conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

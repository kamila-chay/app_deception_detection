The subject’s frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or confusion, which could be interpreted as signs of cognitive effort related to fabricating information. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect genuine puzzlement or concern about the topic being discussed. Their frequent blinking could indicate stress or anxiety typically associated with deception, as lying may increase cognitive load and nervousness. However, frequent blinking might also result from environmental factors such as lighting or dry eyes, or simply be a natural response to emotional stimuli unrelated to dishonesty. The slight upward movement of the lip corners presents an interesting dual interpretation: it could be a controlled attempt to appear more trustworthy or amicable, potentially masking hidden intent, or it might reflect a genuine, subtle smile indicative of honesty and engagement. Furthermore, the chin moving upwards can be read as a defensive or assertive posture, possibly signaling an effort to conceal true feelings or maintain confidence during deception. On the other hand, this gesture might just express attentiveness or pride in the conversation, without any link to deceit. Lastly, their direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen as a deliberate effort to establish credibility and control the interaction, which might be characteristic of someone trying to persuade while being untruthful. Yet, sustained eye contact is also a common marker of sincerity and openness, often maintained by truthful individuals to foster trust. Taken together, these behaviors offer ambiguous cues that, without additional context, do not conclusively point to deception or truthfulness; a more holistic view of the interaction and situational factors would be necessary to draw a reliable conclusion.

They maintain gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as individuals who are truthful often feel comfortable engaging directly and transparently. This behavior can signal openness and willingness to communicate clearly, reinforcing the impression that the person is being forthright. Conversely, deliberate gaze towards the interlocutor may also be a strategy employed to mask deception. People who are fabricating or concealing information might exaggerate eye contact to appear more convincing or to control the interaction, as avoiding eye contact is a more stereotypical marker of lying rather than its absence. Therefore, the same steady gaze could be an attempt at overcompensation rather than a genuine indication of truthfulness. Without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions about their veracity solely based on this visible behavior.

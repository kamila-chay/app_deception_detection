The subject’s smile, combined with the upward movement of the lip corners, might suggest they are genuinely engaged and comfortable in the interaction, potentially indicating truthfulness. However, a smile can also be strategically deployed to mask discomfort or to manipulate the impression they make, thus raising the possibility of deception. The raising of eyebrows often signals surprise or openness, which might support sincerity, yet it can also be an exaggerated attempt to appear credible or to divert attention from inconsistencies.

Frequent blinking is a behavior that has been associated with heightened cognitive load or stress, which could point towards withholding the truth or fabricating information. Conversely, blinking rates can increase simply due to environmental factors like lighting or dry eyes, or even as a natural physiological response during communication. The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor typically conveys engagement and honesty, but when juxtaposed with occasional sideways glances, it invites a more nuanced interpretation—these lateral looks might reflect efforts to fabricate details or avoid direct confrontation, or alternatively, they could signify the natural process of retrieving memories or verifying internal thoughts.

Chin movements downward, alongside a turning of the head to the side, may denote submission or discomfort, often interpreted as signs of withholding information or nervousness associated with deceit. On the other hand, such gestures might simply reflect attentiveness, reflection, or a thoughtful moment during dialogue. Head shaking generally connotes disagreement or negation, which might suggest resistance to the questioning or a defensive stance, potentially aligning with deceptive behavior. Yet it could also be a genuine expression of disagreement or an attempt to clarify a point clearly.

Finally, the subject’s open arms posture might indicate transparency and receptivity, supporting an impression of honesty. Alternatively, open arms could be employed as a deliberate nonverbal strategy to appear more trustworthy and unguarded. Ultimately, these behaviors must be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction, with an understanding that each cue has multiple plausible explanations, and relying on isolated signals may not yield definitive conclusions about truthfulness or deception.

The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing honesty. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest a willingness to engage openly and truthfully, signaling confidence and sincerity. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate effort to appear credible while hiding true intentions, as some people overcompensate by fixing their gaze to mask deception. Their gaze downward introduces a similarly dual interpretation. Looking down might reveal discomfort or guilt often associated with deceit, possibly indicating avoidance of direct interaction to conceal something. However, it could just as easily reflect genuine contemplation or the natural tendency to look away when processing complex information, with no connection to dishonesty. The side-turn of the head adds another layer of ambiguity. It might suggest evasiveness or an attempt to distance oneself from the conversation emotionally, which could accompany deceptive behavior. Alternatively, this gesture can be a neutral expression of thoughtfulness or even fatigue, not necessarily linked to deceit. Ultimately, without additional context, each behavior could either reinforce suspicions of deception or be perfectly consistent with truthful communication, underscoring the importance of considering the broader situational and psychological factors before drawing conclusions.

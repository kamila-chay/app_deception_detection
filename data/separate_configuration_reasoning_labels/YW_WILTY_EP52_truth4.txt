The individual’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as many people instinctively look at others to establish trust and convey transparency. On the other hand, it could also be a deliberate effort to appear sincere and mask deceit, as some individuals consciously maintain strong eye contact to avoid suspicion. The visible shrug further complicates the interpretation. A shrug might indicate uncertainty or a lack of knowledge, which can be genuine in situations where the person is unsure or lacks complete information. Conversely, it could also be a subtle gesture reflecting evasiveness or an attempt to distance oneself from the truth without directly denying it. Because these behaviors can signify both openness and defensiveness depending on the broader context—such as the topic being discussed, baseline behavior of the individual, and other nonverbal cues—it is difficult to definitively categorize the person as truthful or deceptive without additional information.

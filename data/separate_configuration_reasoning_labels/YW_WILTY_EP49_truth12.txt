The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, sustained eye contact often signals confidence and openness, suggesting that the person feels comfortable and has nothing to hide. This steady gaze could indicate sincerity and an attempt to foster trust. Conversely, it is also possible that the individual is consciously maintaining eye contact as a deliberate strategy to appear honest and mask any deceptive intent. In certain situations, individuals who are fabricating information might overcompensate by locking eyes with the listener, aiming to avoid suspicion.

Similarly, the person’s display of palms facing upwards is another behavior with dual interpretations. Traditionally, open palms are associated with honesty, submission, or a willingness to communicate openly, reinforcing the notion that the person is being truthful. This gesture can be a nonverbal cue of transparency, signaling that nothing is being concealed. However, open palms might also be employed deliberately as a calming or placating gesture, intended to deflect doubt or disarm the listener when the speaker is uneasy about their statements. In this sense, it could serve as a subtle attempt to manipulate perceptions of credibility.

Ultimately, these behaviors require contextualization within the broader interaction and additional cues to draw a more definitive conclusion. While the gaze and open palm gestures can each hint at genuineness, they can equally be part of a calculated approach to feign honesty, underscoring the complexity of interpreting nonverbal signals in isolation.

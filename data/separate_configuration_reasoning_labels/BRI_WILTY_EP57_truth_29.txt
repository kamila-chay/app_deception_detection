The subject’s frowning eyebrows might suggest a degree of discomfort or cognitive effort, which could be interpreted as a sign of deception where they are struggling to maintain a fabricated narrative. Conversely, this expression may simply reflect concentration or confusion in processing a complex question, indicating sincere engagement rather than deceit. Their chin moving upwards could be perceived as a subtle display of defensiveness or an attempt to assert confidence in the face of scrutiny, potentially masking dishonesty. Yet, the same gesture might also be an unconscious posture adjustment or a natural expression of assertiveness without any deceptive intent.

The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which traditionally is seen as a marker of openness and honesty. However, sustained eye contact can sometimes be deliberately used to convince or manipulate, and thus could signal controlled behavior often associated with deception. The intermittent sideways glances further complicate the interpretation; such glancing away could point to evasiveness or discomfort in lying, but equally might be indicative of the person recalling information or simply momentarily distracted.

Lastly, their head shaking could be a nonverbal cue to deny or reject information, potentially a subtle way to disassociate from the truth. Yet, head shaking might also simply be a natural reflex or an empathetic gesture expressing disagreement or disbelief independent of any deceitful motive. The full meaning of these behaviors can only be reliably assessed within the broader context, considering baseline behavior, situational factors, and verbal content.

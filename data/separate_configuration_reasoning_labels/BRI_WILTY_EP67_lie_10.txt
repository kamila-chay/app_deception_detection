The person’s gaze directed sideways can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing the potential for deception. On one hand, a sideways gaze might suggest avoidance or discomfort, possibly indicating that the individual is attempting to distance themselves from the topic or conceal information. This behavior could signal cognitive efforts to fabricate a response or manage the stress associated with deception. On the other hand, a sideways look may simply be a natural part of the person’s communication style or a momentary distraction unrelated to deceit. It could also reflect genuine contemplation or the process of recalling information, which naturally causes the gaze to shift away from direct eye contact. 

Similarly, the act of showing palms up carries ambiguous implications. It may denote openness and honesty, symbolizing a willingness to be transparent and cooperative, which supports a truthful interpretation. However, the same gesture could also serve as a calculated attempt to appear sincere and trustworthy, potentially masking underlying falsehoods. The palms-up motion might be employed deliberately to elicit empathy or deflect suspicion, highlighting its dual potential in signaling both candor and deception.

Ultimately, the evaluation of these behaviors depends heavily on the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors. Without considering the full spectrum of cues and circumstances, any conclusion regarding truthfulness or deception remains tentative.

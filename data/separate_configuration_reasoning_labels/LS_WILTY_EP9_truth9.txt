The subject’s lips are retracted, a behavior that could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signal discomfort or tension, potentially linked to the cognitive load of fabricating information. However, it could equally be a simple reaction to an external stimulus, such as bright lighting or a spontaneous emotional response unrelated to deception. The upward movement of the chin also offers ambiguous cues. It may suggest defensiveness or an attempt to assert dominance, which some associate with hiding the truth. Conversely, it could simply reflect confidence or engagement in the conversation, indicating openness rather than concealment.

Regarding gaze behavior, the subject alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing downward. Direct eye contact might be seen as a strategy to persuade or assert honesty, but it can also be a deliberate attempt to overcompensate for deceit. Meanwhile, looking down can indicate discomfort or evasion, often linked to dishonesty, but it might also signify genuine reflection or embarrassment in a truthful exchange. The subject’s head movements—both turning to the side and moving upward—add further complexity. A side-turn of the head may be interpreted as avoidance or reluctance to engage fully, hinting at possible deception. Yet, it may also represent a natural shift in attention or an effort to process information thoughtfully. Similarly, lifting the head could be perceived as a form of defiance or distancing when fabricating, or alternatively as an expression of confidence and openness in a candid dialogue.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors can be reasonably explained by both truthful and deceptive intentions. Without additional context—such as baseline behavior, verbal content, or environmental factors—it is challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the subject’s honesty. Careful consideration of the broader situational dynamics is essential to reliably interpret these subtle behavioral cues.

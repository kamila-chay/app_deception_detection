Conversely, the scowl could simply indicate genuine displeasure or concentration related to the topic being discussed, without any intent to deceive. The act of raising eyebrows is often associated with surprise or questioning, which in a deceptive context might signal an attempt to feign innocence or disbelief. However, raised eyebrows can also be a natural response to unexpected or sensitive information, not necessarily linked to dishonesty. 

Their lip corners turning up could denote a subtle smile, which might be interpreted as a nervous or forced gesture masking deceit. On the other hand, it might represent genuine politeness or an effort to maintain rapport with the interlocutor, unrelated to any motivation to deceive. The gaze directed toward the interlocutor shows engagement and attentiveness, which can be seen as openness typically associated with truthfulness. Yet, the occasional sideways glances may raise suspicion, possibly reflecting attempts to evade direct eye contact when fabricating a story, or alternatively, they might simply indicate thoughtful reflection or searching for the right words.

Finally, the subject’s head shaking could be interpreted as denial or disagreement, which in the context of deception might suggest an effort to resist admitting falsehoods. Conversely, the head shake might genuinely express disagreement or disbelief, reinforcing an honest stance. Without additional context, these behaviors alone cannot definitively determine truthfulness or deception; they require careful consideration within the broader communicative environment and the content of the interaction.

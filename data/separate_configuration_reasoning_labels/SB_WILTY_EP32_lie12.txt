The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signify surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and truthfulness in the interaction. Conversely, this same gesture could be a subtle cue of incredulity or disbelief, possibly indicating an effort to manipulate or distract from the truth. Their chin moving downwards may further complicate the interpretation. This action could convey humility or pensiveness, traits associated with honest reflection. Alternatively, it might signal defensiveness or an attempt to physically lower themselves to avoid scrutiny, which can be a classic nonverbal indicator of discomfort related to deception.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often has a dual significance. Direct eye contact is generally associated with confidence and honesty, fostering trust and engagement. However, in some cases, sustained gaze can be deliberately used to mask deceit, exert control over the conversation, or intimidate the questioner. The subtle head tilting displayed might also have contrasting interpretations. It can reflect active listening, empathy, and openness — qualities aligned with truthful communication. On the other hand, the tilt might be a calculated posture to appear more agreeable or disarming, which could be a tactic employed when fabricating information.

Ultimately, these behaviors do not unequivocally point to either truthfulness or deception without considering the broader context, baseline behaviors, and other verbal and nonverbal cues. Each gesture can carry multiple meanings, making a conclusive judgment reliant on an integrated analysis rather than isolated observations.

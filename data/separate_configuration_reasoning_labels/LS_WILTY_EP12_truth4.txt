The subject is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate effort to feign sincerity or to mask discomfort. Their exaggerated eye closing may suggest an attempt to shield their emotions or to momentarily disengage from the conversation, which could be indicative of concealment. Alternatively, this might simply be a natural response to processing information or a habitual expression without any deceptive intent. The subject’s mouth remains closed, potentially reflecting restraint or hesitation that might align with withholding information. Yet, a closed mouth can also communicate concentration or respectfulness in dialogue rather than deceit.

Notably, the lip corners are turned downward and the lips retracted, which might point to underlying tension or negative emotions possibly related to fabricating or suppressing the truth. On the other hand, these expressions could be spontaneous reactions to the topic at hand or signs of discomfort that do not necessarily imply dishonesty. The chin moving downwards might be viewed as a defensive gesture, as if retreating or lowering oneself to minimize engagement, which some theories associate with evasiveness. In contrast, it may simply reflect contemplation or a momentary shift in posture unconnected to deceptive behavior.

The subject maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, a sign often linked to confidence and truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can sometimes be consciously maintained to appear credible when one is actually being deceptive. Simultaneously, the head moving backward can be seen as creating physical distance, potentially signaling discomfort or a desire to disengage, possibly supporting the notion of concealment. Conversely, leaning backward might just indicate a relaxed stance or an intent to listen thoughtfully. Finally, the head shaking gesture might communicate disagreement or denial, which could align with a fabricated response, but it might equally represent a genuine reaction to the discussion or a nonverbal emphasis on a truthful statement.

In sum, each behavior observed carries potential interpretations that support both truthful and deceptive motives. Without additional contextual information, such as verbal content, baseline behaviors, or situational factors, it remains challenging to definitively ascribe these nonverbal cues to either honesty or deception.

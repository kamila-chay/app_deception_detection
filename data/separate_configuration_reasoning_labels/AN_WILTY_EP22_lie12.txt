The subject consistently directs their gaze toward the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in opposing ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest openness and a desire to engage honestly, as individuals often maintain eye contact to convey sincerity and build trust. Conversely, it could also be a conscious effort to appear truthful, as some deceptive individuals overcompensate by staring directly into the eyes to avoid suspicion. Similarly, their nodding behavior could be read as a sign of active listening and agreement, indicating genuine attentiveness and willingness to cooperate. On the other hand, repetitive nodding might be employed strategically to encourage the interlocutor to continue speaking or to signal agreement without genuine conviction, possibly masking underlying deceit. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors hinges on the larger situational context and additional cues, making it premature to draw firm conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness based solely on gaze and nodding.

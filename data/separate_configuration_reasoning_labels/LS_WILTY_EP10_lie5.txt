The subject’s exaggerated mouth opening could be seen as a sign of heightened emotional expression, potentially indicating surprise or a subconscious attempt to emphasize honesty. Conversely, such an overt gesture might be a deliberate exaggeration designed to draw attention away from deception, serving as a theatrical cue rather than a genuine reaction. The visible retraction of the lips might suggest tension or discomfort, possibly reflecting internal conflict or the stress associated with withholding information. On the other hand, it could simply be a natural facial adjustment or a momentary expression unrelated to deceit.

Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor often conveys engagement and confidence, which might imply sincerity and openness. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a strategic effort to convince or manipulate, as liars are sometimes coached to sustain gaze to appear truthful. The subject’s head tilting frequently signals interest and attentiveness, potentially reinforcing the impression of genuine communication. Yet, in certain scenarios, head tilting might be employed consciously to soften one's demeanor or mask duplicity by mimicking natural curiosity.

Similarly, the side-turning of the head can be interpreted as a reflective or contemplative gesture, suggesting the person is thoughtfully considering the conversation. In contrast, this movement might serve as a subtle distancing mechanism, indicating hesitation or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation linked to uncomfortable truths. Lastly, head shaking typically denotes disagreement or negation, possibly underscoring an honest refusal or denial. Alternatively, it could be a rehearsed gesture intended to reinforce a fabricated statement, especially if it appears incongruent with the overall verbal narrative.

Ultimately, while these behaviors offer potential cues, their true meaning heavily relies on the broader context, the baseline behavior of the individual, and the congruence with verbal communication, all of which are crucial to forming a balanced and accurate assessment.

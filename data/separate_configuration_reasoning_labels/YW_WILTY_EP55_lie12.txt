The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest discomfort or cognitive effort, which could align with someone attempting to fabricate or conceal information. Conversely, frowning might simply reflect genuine concern, confusion, or concentration when processing complex questions or recalling details. The act of raising eyebrows simultaneously introduces further ambiguity; this gesture can indicate surprise or incredulity, which may be consistent with truthful reactions to unexpected inquiries. However, raised eyebrows can also serve as a deliberate display to feign innocence or emphasize honesty in a deceptive context. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor similarly carries dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact may signal confidence and openness, traits often associated with truthfulness, yet it might also be a conscious strategy to establish credibility and manipulate impressions during deception. Conversely, head shaking could be a straightforward denial or rejection of a statement, reinforcing sincerity. Alternatively, it might function as a subtle nonverbal cue intended to reinforce a false claim or distract from inconsistencies. Lastly, the presentation of palms up is frequently regarded as an indicator of openness and honesty, suggesting transparency; nonetheless, it can also be employed tactically to appear conciliatory or to deflect suspicion when engaged in deceit. Without additional contextual information, these behaviors should be carefully weighed, as each may signify either genuine truthfulness or calculated deception depending on the broader communicative environment.

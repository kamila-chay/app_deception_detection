The subject's frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, furrowed brows might indicate cognitive effort, as the individual concentrates on fabricating details or carefully constructing a story to avoid being caught in a lie. This expression can also signal discomfort or stress, emotions often associated with the anxiety that deception might provoke. Conversely, a frown may simply reflect genuine confusion, concern, or the natural expression of focus when attempting to recall specific information. It could also be a response to the nature of the conversation or the seriousness of the topic rather than an indicator of concealment. Ultimately, without additional behavioral or contextual cues, the presence of frowning eyebrows alone remains ambiguous, requiring careful integration with other signs and situational factors to assess truthfulness more accurately.

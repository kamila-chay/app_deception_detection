The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be seen from multiple perspectives. On one hand, this gesture might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, suggesting openness and engagement in the conversation. On the other hand, it could also be a calculated expression designed to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception or to feign sincerity, especially if the raised eyebrows appear exaggerated or inconsistent with the verbal message. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor typically conveys attentiveness and willingness to engage truthfully. However, maintaining eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy employed by individuals attempting to mask deception, as they may overcompensate to avoid appearing untrustworthy. Conversely, a gaze directed upward is often interpreted as a sign of cognitive processing, such as trying to recall information, which might support the notion of truthfulness. Yet, upward glances can also indicate mental fabrication or evasiveness, depending on the individual’s baseline behavior and the complexity of the questions asked.

Meanwhile, the hands rubbing might be indicative of nervousness or discomfort commonly associated with deceptive behavior, reflecting an internal conflict between maintaining a lie and managing anxiety. Conversely, this action can merely be a self-soothing gesture or habitual movement unrelated to deceit, perhaps stemming from stress, cold, or simply routine body language. Ultimately, these behaviors should be evaluated in the broader context of the interaction, considering baseline behaviors, situational factors, and verbal cues, before drawing any definitive conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness or deception.

The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing potential deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and engagement, which often aligns with truthfulness, as individuals who are being honest tend to openly face their questioner. It could also indicate that the person is fully focused on the conversation, demonstrating transparency and sincerity. On the other hand, prolonged or intense gaze can sometimes be a deliberate tactic to mask deception, as individuals may use eye contact strategically to convince or manipulate the listener, attempting to appear forthright while hiding the truth. Furthermore, such gaze might be a way to control the interaction, putting pressure on the interlocutor to accept their statements. Without broader behavioral context or additional information, the interpretation of this gaze remains ambiguous; it might equally represent honesty or calculated effort to deceive.

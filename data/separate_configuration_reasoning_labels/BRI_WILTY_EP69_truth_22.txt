The subject's gaze shifting upward could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, looking up might suggest they are accessing visual memories or constructing a narrative, which some theories associate with deception as the individual attempts to fabricate or embellish details. Conversely, this upward gaze might simply reflect genuine recall, as many individuals naturally look up when trying to remember or visualize information. Similarly, the moments when their gaze drops downward can be seen through a dual lens. This downward look might indicate discomfort or an effort to avoid eye contact, often linked with evasiveness or concealment. However, it may also represent thoughtful reflection or a moment of introspection, signaling honesty as they carefully consider their response. Without additional cues or contextual understanding, it is challenging to definitively attribute these gaze behaviors to either deception or truthfulness, underscoring the importance of a holistic evaluation rather than isolated interpretation.

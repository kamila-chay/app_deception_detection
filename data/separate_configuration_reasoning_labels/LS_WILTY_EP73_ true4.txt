The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, steady eye contact might suggest confidence and engagement, which are often associated with truthfulness. Maintaining gaze can also indicate a desire to be open and honest. Conversely, intense or prolonged eye contact could be a deliberate effort to mask deception, as some individuals may overcompensate by staring to appear credible. Similarly, moments when the subject looks down might signal discomfort or avoidance, potentially reflecting internal conflict or the concealment of information. However, looking down can also be a natural sign of contemplation or modesty, rather than evasion. This shift in gaze could simply relate to processing a question thoughtfully rather than signaling deceit. The subject’s nodding presents yet another dual interpretation. It might demonstrate agreement and cooperation, reinforcing sincerity and attentiveness to the conversation. Alternatively, it could be a strategic behavior aimed at encouraging the interlocutor’s trust or support, aligning with patterns often seen when someone is trying to manipulate perceptions. Ultimately, without additional context or corroborating cues, these behaviors can just as easily suggest honesty as they might hint at deception, underscoring the complexity of interpreting nonverbal signals in isolation.

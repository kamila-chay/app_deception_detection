The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might suggest a genuine attempt to convey friendliness and openness, which can be associated with truthful communication. However, smiles can also be deliberately employed to mask discomfort or to create a false sense of trust, especially if they appear forced or inconsistent with other cues. Their raised eyebrows could indicate surprise or sincerity, often signaling engagement and honesty, yet such a gesture might also be strategically used to feign innocence or to distract from the truth. Frequent blinking is another behavior open to dual interpretation; it might reflect cognitive processing or slight nervousness common in truthful recounting, but equally, it could indicate stress or the effort involved in fabricating information. The sideways gaze might imply avoidance or discomfort, potentially hinting at deception, but it could just as well be a sign of someone withdrawing momentarily to access memory or to organize their thoughts. 

The forward movement of the head can be seen as a gesture of earnestness and interest, reinforcing sincerity, though it might also be a subtle assertive tactic to dominate the interaction or to push a particular narrative. Arms open typically convey openness and receptivity, aligning with truthful disclosure, whereas arms folded often suggest defensiveness or self-protection, which could undermine credibility. Conversely, crossed arms might simply reflect a comfortable or habitual posture unrelated to deception. Given these overlapping possibilities, each behavior’s significance depends heavily on the broader context, baseline behaviors, and the interplay of verbal and nonverbal cues, making it essential to consider the full spectrum before drawing conclusions about truthfulness or deception.

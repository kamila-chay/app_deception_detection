The subject’s lip corners fluctuate between turning up and down, a dynamic that can be interpreted in multiple ways. A slight upward movement might suggest a genuine, positive emotional state indicative of truthfulness, or it could be a subtle attempt to mask discomfort or fabricate sincerity. Conversely, downward lip corners may signal sadness or frustration linked to withholding information, yet they might also simply reflect momentary introspection or fatigue. Their chin moving upwards adds another layer of complexity; this gesture can convey confidence and assertiveness, potentially signaling honesty and openness, but it might also be a defensive posture deployed to project control when feeling uncertain or deceptive.

Regarding eye behavior, maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor often fosters trust and transparency, reinforcing the perception of truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can also be consciously maintained to deflect suspicion, serving as a strategic tool in deception. In contrast, a gaze directed downward might imply discomfort or evasion commonly associated with deceit, but it equally might represent careful thought or processing of information in a genuine manner. Head tilting can convey empathy and engagement, aligning with truthful communication, yet in a different context, it might be a calculated move to appear more relatable and disarming when concealing the truth.

Finally, the subject’s open arm posture warrants balanced consideration. Open arms generally suggest openness and receptiveness, hallmarks of sincerity and trust. Yet this stance could also be employed deliberately to create a false sense of openness, masking inner conflict or guardedness. Each of these behaviors carries dual potential interpretations, underscoring the need for a comprehensive understanding of the larger context before drawing conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness or deception.

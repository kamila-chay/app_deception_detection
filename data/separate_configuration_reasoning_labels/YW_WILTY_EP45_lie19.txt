The individual is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This expression might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, suggesting openness and engagement. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be used strategically to feign sincerity or distraction, potentially masking deceit. Their lip corners alternately turn up and down, which creates an ambiguous emotional signal; a slight smile could convey friendliness and truthfulness, whereas the downward movement might reflect discomfort or uncertainty, possibly hinting at concealed information. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor is another complex behavior—steadfast eye contact might demonstrate confidence and transparency, yet it could equally be a deliberate effort to overcompensate and convince the observer of their veracity.

The person’s hands frequently scratching or touching their head and body might be signs of anxiety commonly associated with deception, reflecting inner tension or stress about fabricating details. On the other hand, these movements could simply denote habitual gestures or self-soothing mechanisms unrelated to truthfulness. Their palms up and arms open postures are often seen as indicators of openness and receptivity, which could support the notion of honesty; however, such open gestures could also be consciously employed to appear more credible and disarm suspicion. Finally, the occasional shrug may signal uncertainty or lack of knowledge, consistent with truthful admission of ignorance, but it might just as well act as a nonverbal deflection intended to avoid providing direct answers.

Overall, these behaviors offer clues that can be interpreted in opposing ways, underscoring the importance of considering the broader context before drawing any conclusions about credibility.

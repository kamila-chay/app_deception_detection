The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners may suggest a genuine expression of friendliness and openness, contributing to the impression of truthfulness. Conversely, these same facial signals could also be consciously controlled attempts to appear sincere, potentially masking discomfort or deceit. Their raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or engagement, which can be interpreted as an honest reaction to the conversation. However, raised eyebrows might also serve as a deliberate signal to elicit trust or soften the delivery of a potentially untruthful statement.

Frequent blinking is often associated with increased cognitive load or stress, possibly pointing to the mental effort involved in fabricating information. Yet, it could also simply reflect normal physiological responses, such as eye dryness or momentary distraction, unrelated to deception. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor generally conveys confidence and openness, commonly linked with truthful behavior. On the other hand, sustained eye contact can sometimes be employed strategically to overcompensate for dishonesty, aiming to convince or distract the listener.

Nodding frequently may signify agreement and engagement, reinforcing the notion of authenticity in the interaction. Nonetheless, it could also be an attempt to mirror the interlocutor’s cues excessively, a tactic sometimes used to build rapport artificially when one is being deceptive. Finally, the open positioning of the arms suggests a relaxed and non-defensive posture often interpreted as a sign of honesty. However, this openness might be a rehearsed gesture designed to project transparency, and without additional context, it remains unclear whether it reflects genuine comfort or calculated behavior.

Ultimately, each of these observed behaviors can be interpreted in multiple ways, and a more comprehensive evaluation, including verbal content and situational factors, is necessary to draw a more reliable conclusion regarding the subject’s truthfulness.

The person’s exaggerated mouth opening might be perceived as an attempt to appear more genuine or to emphasize sincerity, potentially reflecting an effort to convince the listener of their truthfulness. Conversely, such an overemphasized expression could also signal discomfort or a subconscious attempt to mask hesitation, possibly indicating they are not entirely truthful. Their lip corners turning downward might convey sadness or regret, which could support the idea that they are being honest about a troubling situation. On the other hand, this expression could also be a deliberate display to evoke sympathy or to manipulate the interlocutor’s emotions, casting doubt on their veracity.

Regarding their gaze behavior, maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor often suggests openness and confidence, aligning with truthful communication. Yet, purposeful eye contact might also be employed strategically to project credibility and distract from deceptive cues. The occasional sideways glance could be interpreted as a natural means of recalling information or processing thoughts, which aligns with honest behavior. Alternatively, these glances might represent discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct scrutiny, potentially signaling that the person is fabricating or withholding information.

Their head turning to the side adds another layer of complexity. It may indicate contemplation or consideration, which is consistent with a truthful individual reflecting on their responses. Conversely, this gesture could serve as a subtle avoidance tactic, distancing themselves physically during moments of deception. Ultimately, each of these behaviors can be understood in multiple ways, and only by considering the broader context, including verbal content and situational factors, can a more accurate assessment of their truthfulness be made.

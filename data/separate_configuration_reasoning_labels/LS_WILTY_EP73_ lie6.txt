The subject’s gaze directed upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of evaluating honesty. On one hand, looking upwards may suggest that they are accessing their imagination or constructing a narrative, which could indicate that they are fabricating or searching for a story rather than recalling a genuine memory. This behavior can be seen as a subtle indicator of deception, as it aligns with psychological theories that propose eye movements correspond to different cognitive processes, with upward gaze often linked to visualizing fabricated information.

Conversely, the same upward gaze can also be a natural part of memory retrieval. When individuals try to recall details, they sometimes look upwards as they mentally visualize past events or retrieve stored information. In this light, their gaze could simply be a sign of genuine effort to remember and be truthful. Without additional context, such as the subject’s baseline behavior, the content of their speech, or other nonverbal cues, the upward gaze alone remains ambiguous. It may reflect either deception or honesty depending on the broader circumstances and the individual’s typical communication style. Thus, a careful and holistic assessment is necessary before drawing any definitive conclusions about their truthfulness.

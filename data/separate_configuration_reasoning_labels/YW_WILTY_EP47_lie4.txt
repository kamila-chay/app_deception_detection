The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might suggest sincerity and engagement, reflecting a desire to establish trust and convey honesty. Conversely, sustained eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate and mask deceit, attempting to appear credible despite underlying falsehoods. Their head movements further complicate interpretation; moving the head forward might indicate eagerness to communicate and openness, signaling confidence in their statements. Alternatively, it could reflect an aggressive or overly assertive posture used to dominate the interaction and deflect scrutiny. Similarly, the head moving backward could be seen as a natural gestural response denoting thoughtfulness or hesitation while formulating truthful answers, yet it might also suggest discomfort and an instinctive withdrawal triggered by the stress of deception. The presentation of palms upwards adds another layer of ambiguity. This gesture often conveys openness and honesty, symbolizing a lack of concealment. However, it can just as easily be employed manipulatively to feign transparency and elicit sympathy, serving as a subtle tactic to persuade or distract from inconsistencies. Ultimately, these behaviors must be understood within the broader context of the interaction, as each can strongly point toward both authenticity and deceit depending on the surrounding verbal cues, emotional tone, and situational factors.

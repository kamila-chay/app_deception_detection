The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could suggest genuine friendliness and openness, which might support the interpretation that they are being truthful. However, it is also possible that these expressions are deliberately employed to mask discomfort or to create a false sense of sincerity, especially in the context of deception. Their frequent blinking might indicate cognitive load or stress, often associated with fabricating information, yet it could equally be a natural response to lighting conditions, fatigue, or normal conversational dynamics.

The chin moving upwards and the nodding could be signs of confidence and agreement, which would typically align with truthful communication. Alternatively, these behaviors might be consciously exaggerated to convince the interlocutor of their honesty, serving as a social tactic to appear more credible. The subject’s gaze toward the interlocutor is traditionally interpreted as engagement and willingness to connect, possibly signaling transparency; however, when combined with intervals of gaze directed upwards, it might indicate mental searching or rehearsing a fabricated narrative rather than spontaneous memory recall.

Head tilting often conveys empathy and openness, reinforcing perceptions of truthfulness, but in some cases, it might be used strategically to soften the interaction or distract from inconsistencies. Lastly, the display of palms up can be read as a gesture of honesty and submission, hinting at an honest exchange, yet this same gesture can be artificially deployed to elicit trust and conceal deceptive intent.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors holds dual potential meanings, and without additional contextual cues, it is challenging to definitively attribute them to either truthfulness or deception. A holistic assessment integrating verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors is necessary to form a more reliable judgment.

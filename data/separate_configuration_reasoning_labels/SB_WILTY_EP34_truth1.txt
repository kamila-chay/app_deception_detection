The subject’s raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or a heightened emotional response, which might be interpreted as a genuine reaction to the topic at hand. Conversely, this same behavior could also be a deliberate attempt to feign innocence or emphasize honesty, as raised eyebrows are sometimes used to convey sincerity. Their frequent blinking might indicate stress or nervousness, often associated with deceptive behavior, yet it can equally be explained by environmental factors such as dry eyes or simply a natural response to intense concentration. The downward turn of the lip corners might be perceived as a sign of discomfort or sadness that could stem from guilt or awareness of deceit; on the other hand, this expression might just reflect a momentary emotional state unrelated to truthfulness. The direct gaze toward the interlocutor can be seen as a sign of engagement and openness, suggesting honesty, but it could also be deliberately maintained to mask deceit by attempting to appear confident and truthful. Finally, the moments when their gaze shifts upward may indicate attempts to access memory or construct a narrative, which can be consistent with both truth-telling and fabrication. These behaviors, taken together, require additional contextual insights to form a well-grounded interpretation, as each can carry multiple, sometimes opposing, meanings depending on the broader circumstances.

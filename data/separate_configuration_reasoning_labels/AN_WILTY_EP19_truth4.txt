The subject’s gaze behavior exhibits characteristics that could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor might suggest engagement and honesty, presenting a sign of openness and a willingness to communicate truthfully. Such direct eye contact is often associated with confidence and transparency, which could support the notion that the person is being sincere. Conversely, this same behavior could be an intentional strategy to create an impression of credibility, as some individuals who are deceptive may maintain intense eye contact deliberately to avoid suspicion and appear trustworthy.

Additionally, the subject’s gaze shifting upward introduces another layer of complexity in interpretation. On one hand, looking up could indicate that they are recalling information or trying to access visual memory to provide accurate answers, which may align with truthful behavior. This upward gaze can be a natural cognitive process involved in retrieving details from memory during conversation. On the other hand, it might be a sign of fabrication or constructing a narrative, as some theories of deception suggest that people look away or upward when inventing stories or distancing themselves from the truth. This subtle nonverbal cue, therefore, may also point to discomfort or mental effort associated with deceit.

Ultimately, these gaze patterns alone do not conclusively indicate truthfulness or deception. Each behavior can be interpreted differently depending on individual habits, cultural norms, and situational factors. The context in which these behaviors occur, along with additional verbal and nonverbal cues, would be essential to form a more reliable assessment of their veracity.

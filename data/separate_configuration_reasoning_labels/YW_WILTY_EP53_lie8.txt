The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining direct eye contact may suggest honesty and confidence, as it often conveys openness and a willingness to engage sincerely. Such behavior could indicate that the person has nothing to hide and is comfortable with the information being discussed. On the other hand, prolonged or intense eye contact might also be a conscious strategy employed to appear truthful and to mask deceit. In some cases, individuals who are attempting to fabricate information may overcompensate by staring directly at their conversation partner in an effort to build trust or control the interaction. Conversely, the gaze could simply be a natural conversational habit or cultural norm, rather than a deliberate cue related to truthfulness or deception. Without additional behavioral or contextual clues, it is challenging to definitively interpret the significance of the gaze alone, and understanding the broader context is essential to making a more informed assessment.

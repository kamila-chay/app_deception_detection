The subject is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can signal surprise or emphasis on a particular point, which might suggest honesty as they genuinely react to the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows could also be employed strategically to feign sincerity or to momentarily distract the listener, potentially hinting at deception. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor typically conveys engagement and confidence, often associated with truthfulness and direct communication. However, sustained eye contact might also be deliberately maintained to create an impression of transparency, masking underlying deceit. Meanwhile, the moments when the subject’s gaze shifts downward could indicate discomfort or cognitive processing, which can be interpreted as signs of evasion or internal conflict related to fabricating information. On the other hand, looking down might simply reflect natural pauses for thought or modesty without any deceptive intent. Ultimately, these behaviors are nuanced and must be evaluated within the broader context of the interaction to more accurately discern whether the individual is being truthful or deceptive.

The subject is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that could suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially supporting the notion that they are being truthful. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also be employed deliberately to feign openness or innocence, which could indicate deceptive intent. Their frequent blinking could be interpreted as a sign of stress or cognitive load often associated with fabricating information, yet it could just as well be a natural physiological response to lighting conditions or nervousness unrelated to dishonesty. Notably, the downward movement of the chin might reflect submission or uncertainty, possibly signaling discomfort linked to concealing information. On the other hand, it may simply indicate thoughtfulness or a moment of reflection without any deceptive undertones. The subject’s gaze alternates between direct engagement with the interlocutor and downward glances; maintaining eye contact might convey honesty and confidence, but similarly, intentional staring can be a strategy to persuade or mask deceit, while looking down can signal guilt or evasiveness—or alternatively, modesty or cognitive processing. Their head moving backward and turning to the side could be interpreted as distancing themselves from the topic or interlocutor, potentially indicative of discomfort associated with deception. Alternatively, these gestures might merely represent seeking more space or discomfort with physical proximity, not necessarily linked to dishonesty. Finally, the subject’s posture with open arms may be perceived as an open and receptive stance, reinforcing sincerity, but it could equally be a consciously adopted posture to appear non-threatening and trustworthy, perhaps compensating for latent deceit. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the broader context and baseline patterns to draw any substantive conclusions regarding truthfulness or deception.

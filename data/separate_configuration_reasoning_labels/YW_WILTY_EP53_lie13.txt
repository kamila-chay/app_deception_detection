The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted as a genuine expression of surprise or emphasis, suggesting honesty and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also serve as a deliberate attempt to feign sincerity or to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception, potentially signaling deception. Their chin moving downwards might convey submission or contemplation, which can indicate openness and thoughtfulness, aligning with truthfulness. On the other hand, this gesture could be an unconscious attempt to shield oneself or create a barrier, hinting at discomfort or evasiveness often associated with deceit. The gaze directed towards the interlocutor is typically a sign of confidence and willingness to communicate transparently, reflecting truthfulness. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a practiced strategy to appear credible and mask dishonest intentions. When the person’s gaze shifts downward, it might reveal a moment of introspection or emotional processing consistent with recalling genuine information. Alternatively, looking down can be a tactic to avoid direct scrutiny or to hide concealed feelings, which may be indicative of deceptive behavior. Finally, the individual’s nodding might be a natural way to affirm understanding and agreement, demonstrating cooperation and truthfulness. Yet, nodding can also be employed to create a false sense of rapport or to persuade the listener, potentially masking underlying deception. These observed behaviors must therefore be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction to draw more accurate conclusions.

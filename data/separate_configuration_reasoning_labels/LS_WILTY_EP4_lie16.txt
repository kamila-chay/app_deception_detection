The subject’s chin moving upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, it might signal a defensive posture or an attempt to appear more confident and authoritative, which can sometimes be a tactic used to mask deception. Conversely, this upward movement could simply reflect a natural gesture of confidence or attentiveness without any deceptive connotations. Similarly, their direct gaze towards the interlocutor could suggest straightforwardness and openness, qualities typically associated with truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can also be deliberately maintained by someone trying to convince or manipulate, as a strategy to establish credibility and control the interaction. The moments when they shift their gaze downward introduce further ambiguity. Looking down can sometimes indicate discomfort, guilt, or a subconscious desire to avoid scrutiny—potentially signalling dishonesty. On the other hand, such downward glances might just reflect the person processing information, recalling memories, or feeling momentarily shy or introspective, all of which are neutral behaviors. Ultimately, these visible behaviors have multiple plausible interpretations, and understanding whether they signify truthfulness or deception depends heavily on the overall context, the individual’s baseline behavior, and additional cues beyond what is immediately observable.

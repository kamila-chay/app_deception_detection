The subject’s gaze shifting upward may be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing their truthfulness. One perspective suggests that looking upward could be a cognitive effort to access or construct memories, possibly indicating an attempt to fabricate information. This behavior might signal that the individual is engaging in mental imagery to create a story rather than recalling factual events. Conversely, the same upward gaze could simply reflect genuine memory retrieval, as people often look upward when trying to remember details from their past. Therefore, without additional context, it is difficult to assign a deceptive motive to this action alone.

Similarly, the subject’s gaze directed sideways carries ambiguous implications. On one hand, sideways glances might imply discomfort or evasiveness, which could be symptomatic of someone hiding the truth or feeling uneasy about what they are communicating. These glances can be interpreted as a subtle avoidance mechanism, diverting attention away from direct engagement in an attempt to obscure dishonesty. On the other hand, looking sideways can also be a natural, unconscious behavior associated with retrieving memories or processing information. It might reflect the person’s internal cognitive process rather than an intention to deceive.

Taken together, the combination of upward and sideways gazes may hint at efforts to gather or organize thoughts, which can be consistent with both truthful recall and fabrication. Each behavior, in isolation or combination, lacks definitive evidence of deception without considering the broader communicative context, the subject’s baseline behaviors, and the content of their statements. A comprehensive evaluation that includes verbal cues and situational factors would be necessary to make a more informed judgment regarding their honesty.

The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest transparency and confidence, potentially indicating that they are being truthful and open in the interaction. Conversely, sustained gaze could also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, as some individuals employ direct eye contact to appear sincere and deflect suspicion. Similarly, the visible palms-up gesture can be seen as a sign of openness and honesty, commonly associated with an intention to convey truthfulness and vulnerability. However, this same gesture might be employed tactically to create an impression of sincerity and goodwill, thereby serving as a subtle form of manipulation in a deceptive context. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful consideration of additional contextual cues and the individual’s baseline demeanor, as both gaze and hand gestures hold ambiguous meanings that can support either truthful or deceptive interpretations depending on the broader conversational dynamics.

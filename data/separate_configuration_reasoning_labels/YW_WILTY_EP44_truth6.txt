The individual’s expression includes lip corners turned upward, which could be seen as a genuine sign of friendliness and openness, suggesting they are comfortable and sincere in the conversation. Conversely, this same smile might be a strategic effort to mask discomfort or to appear trustworthy when they are, in fact, concealing information. Their gaze remains focused on the interlocutor, which often reflects engagement and honesty, as sustained eye contact can indicate transparency. However, maintaining direct eye contact can also be a deliberate tactic to overcompensate and distract from deceptive intentions.

The person's head moving backward introduces further ambiguity. It might denote a natural reaction of thoughtfulness or a momentary need for personal space, signaling a relaxed and honest posture. Alternatively, it could represent subtle avoidance or discomfort that aligns with withholding truth or feeling defensive. The presence of palms up is traditionally associated with openness and a willingness to share, reinforcing the impression of candidness. Yet, this gesture can be consciously employed to convey innocence and deflect suspicion even if the individual is being untruthful.

Finally, their arms are open, a posture that generally suggests receptiveness and a lack of concealment, often interpreted as an honest stance. On the other hand, openness in body language can be a calculated move designed to put others at ease and lower their guard, which might be part of a deceptive strategy. In sum, while these behaviors individually can signal truthfulness, each may also be interpreted as potentially masking deceit depending on the broader context and the interplay of verbal and nonverbal cues. Additional information about the situation and baseline behaviors is essential to form a more definitive assessment.

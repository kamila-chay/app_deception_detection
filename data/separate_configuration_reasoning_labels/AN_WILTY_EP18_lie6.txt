The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows and exhibiting exaggerated eye opening can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, such expressions might suggest an attempt to emphasize sincerity or to appear more credible, possibly as a means of compensating for dishonesty. These exaggerated gestures could be deliberate efforts to persuade the interlocutor or to mask underlying discomfort. On the other hand, raised eyebrows and wide-open eyes might simply reflect genuine surprise, eagerness to engage, or an earnest effort to communicate clearly and openly, which are consistent with truthful behavior.

Their gaze towards the interlocutor further complicates the interpretation. Direct eye contact can be a strong indicator of honesty, as it often conveys openness and confidence. It may also suggest that the person is attentive and engaged in the conversation. Conversely, an intense gaze might be a conscious strategy to convince or manipulate, aiming to project trustworthiness despite possible deception. The subtle shifts in gaze, such as looking down, also carry ambiguous meanings. Avoiding direct eye contact by looking down could be a classic sign of discomfort or guilt associated with deceit. Alternatively, it could simply indicate thoughtfulness, modesty, or momentary reflection, which are not necessarily connected to dishonesty.

Given these mixed signals—raised eyebrows, exaggerated eye opening, shifting gaze towards and away from the interlocutor—any conclusions about deception should be drawn cautiously. These behaviors can serve both as potential markers of deception and as entirely natural expressions of truthful communication, depending on the broader context and the individual’s baseline behavior. Additional cues and situational factors would therefore be essential to form a more reliable judgment.

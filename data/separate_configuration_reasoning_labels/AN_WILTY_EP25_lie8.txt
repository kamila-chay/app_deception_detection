The individual is maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering possible deception. On one hand, sustained eye contact may signal confidence and honesty, suggesting that the person is comfortable with the truth they are conveying and is open to engagement. This direct gaze can be a sign of sincerity, reflecting a willingness to connect and be transparent in communication. On the other hand, consistent eye contact might also be a deliberate strategy to appear truthful and distract from underlying deceit. Some individuals who are being deceptive may overcompensate by maintaining strong eye contact to avoid suspicion, consciously trying to mask their dishonesty through perceived confidence. Moreover, cultural norms and individual differences significantly influence gaze patterns, meaning that what seems like honest engagement in one context might be a rehearsed behavior in another. Without the broader conversational and situational context, it is challenging to definitively interpret the meaning behind their gaze, underscoring the importance of considering additional cues and information before drawing conclusions about their truthfulness.

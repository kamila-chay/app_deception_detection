The subject’s lips are retracted, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, this behavior might suggest discomfort or tension, possibly indicating that the person is experiencing stress related to deception. The retraction of the lips could be a subtle attempt to suppress speech or emotions, hinting at underlying unease associated with fabricating or withholding information. However, on the other hand, lip retraction might simply be a natural facial expression unrelated to deceit, such as a habitual gesture, a response to an external stimulus, or an unconscious muscle movement. It could also be reflective of concentration or thoughtfulness rather than deception. Without additional contextual clues, interpreting this behavior as definitive evidence for either truthfulness or deception remains uncertain, and broader behavioral patterns would need to be considered for a more informed judgment.

The individual’s direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and sincerity, suggesting that the person is being truthful and open in their communication. It can convey engagement and a willingness to be transparent, which might indicate that the subject has nothing to hide. Conversely, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy employed by someone who is deceptive, as they might try to appear more convincing or trustworthy by forcing a connection with the listener. In some cases, this intense focus can mask underlying discomfort or the cognitive effort required to fabricate information. Furthermore, cultural and individual differences play a significant role—in some cultures or personalities, steady eye contact is a norm, regardless of truthfulness, while in others it might be less common or interpreted differently. Because of these complexities, interpreting this behavior in isolation is challenging, and a more conclusive assessment would require additional contextual cues and behavioral patterns to determine whether the gaze signifies honesty or deception.

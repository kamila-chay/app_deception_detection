The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest engagement and sincerity, indicating they are confident and forthcoming in the conversation. Conversely, maintained eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to appear truthful while concealing deceit, as some individuals overcompensate by staring intently to mask their discomfort. When the person looks down, this behavior could be interpreted as a sign of introspection or humility, possibly reflecting genuine thoughtfulness or emotional vulnerability. However, gaze aversion, including looking down, is also commonly associated with feelings of guilt or an attempt to avoid confrontation, which may hint at evasiveness or dishonesty. The subtle head side-turn could signal openness and attentiveness, reflecting a relaxed or contemplative state consistent with truthful communication. Alternatively, it might be a defensive gesture or an unconscious effort to physically distance themselves from the topic or question, which can be an indicator of discomfort tied to deception. Ultimately, these behaviors carry ambiguous meanings that depend heavily on the broader situational context, baseline behavior, and additional verbal and nonverbal cues to draw a more definitive conclusion regarding truthfulness or deception.

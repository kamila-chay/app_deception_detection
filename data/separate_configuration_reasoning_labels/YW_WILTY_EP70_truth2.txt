The subject's gaze behavior offers a nuanced perspective that can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest openness and confidence, potentially signaling truthfulness and engagement in the conversation. Maintaining eye contact often conveys sincerity and a willingness to connect, which are qualities associated with honest communication. Conversely, this same focused gaze could also be a deliberate effort to appear credible, as individuals who are deceptive sometimes intensify eye contact to compensate for their dishonesty or to persuade the listener of their truthfulness.

On the other hand, the moments when the subject’s gaze shifts upward introduce additional layers to the interpretation. Looking upward might indicate that they are accessing memories or trying to recall accurate details, which aligns with genuine attempts at honest communication. This upward gaze can reflect cognitive effort in piecing together truthful responses. However, it could just as easily be interpreted as a sign of evasion or mental diversion, where the subject subconsciously looks away to disengage from the stress of fabricating information or to avoid direct confrontation.

Both gaze patterns, therefore, must be contextualized within the broader interaction and behavioral baseline of the individual. Without considering additional cues or background information, these visual signals alone provide ambiguous evidence that can support either truthful engagement or deceptive behavior. Further analysis and corroboration would be required to draw a more definitive conclusion.

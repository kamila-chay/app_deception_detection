The subject’s gaze behavior, alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and shifting their gaze downward, presents nuanced indicators that could be interpreted from multiple perspectives. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor might suggest openness and confidence, potentially reinforcing the credibility of their statements. It could also demonstrate engagement and attentiveness, typical of someone who is truthful and wants to connect sincerely. Conversely, sustained gaze towards the interlocutor can sometimes be a conscious effort to appear convincing, as individuals who are deceptive may overcompensate by trying to establish eye contact deliberately to mask their dishonesty.

On the other hand, the moments when the subject looks downward could be perceived in contrasting ways as well. Such gaze aversion is often considered a classic sign of discomfort or evasion, which might hint at an attempt to conceal information or internal conflict related to deception. It can also reflect cognitive load, as fabricating information may require more mental effort, causing the person to look away while constructing their narrative. However, looking down can equally be interpreted as a natural reaction to recalling difficult or complex memories, as people often avert their gaze when processing thoughts or feelings. It may also signal modesty, shyness, or respect in the context of the conversation, none of which are inherently linked to deceit.

In summary, the interplay between direct gaze and downward glances in this individual’s behavior does not provide a definitive indicator of truthfulness or deception on its own. Interpreting these signals reliably requires a broader understanding of the context, including baseline behaviors, the nature of the interaction, and additional verbal and nonverbal cues. Only by situating these gaze patterns within the bigger picture can a more informed conclusion be drawn.

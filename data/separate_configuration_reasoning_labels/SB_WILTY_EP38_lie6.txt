The subject's smile, accompanied by the lip corners turning up, may suggest a genuine expression of friendliness or comfort in the interaction, which often aligns with truthful communication. However, smiles can also be deliberately employed to mask discomfort or to feign sincerity, making it a potential tool for deception depending on the broader context. The raising of the eyebrows can indicate surprise or engagement, signaling openness; conversely, it might be a calculated gesture to appear more convincing or to manipulate the interlocutor's perception. Movements of the chin, both upwards and downwards, add another layer of interpretation. An upward chin movement could convey confidence or assertiveness, often associated with straightforwardness, yet it might also be a subtle sign of defensiveness or arrogance when fabricating a story. Conversely, a downward chin movement can signal submission or contemplation, which could reflect honest reflection or, alternatively, an attempt to appear humble while concealing dishonesty.

The subject’s gaze behavior presents further complexity. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor is traditionally seen as a marker of truthfulness and openness. Still, maintaining steady eye contact can also be consciously practiced to avoid suspicion, making it less reliable in isolation. In contrast, occasional sideways glances might suggest evasiveness or discomfort typical of deceptive behavior; yet, these glances could equally represent moments of cognitive effort or the natural process of recollecting information. The nodding and forward movement of the head could reflect engagement and agreement, indicating a cooperative and genuine demeanor. On the other hand, these same gestures might be strategically used to persuade, to reinforce an untruthful narrative, or to mask hesitation.

Similarly, the backward movement of the head and side-turns can signal distancing or discomfort, which might raise suspicion about the veracity of the subject’s statements. Yet, such movements could also stem from processing complex information or even momentary distraction, unrelated to deceit. Finally, the subject’s open arms posture typically conveys openness and lack of defensiveness, traits often linked with honesty. Nevertheless, open arms could also be a deliberate attempt to appear non-threatening and trustworthy, carefully crafted to lower the interlocutor’s guard.

In sum, the observed behaviors each carry dual potential meanings that can be interpreted as indicators of either truthfulness or deception. Without additional contextual information, drawing a definitive conclusion remains challenging; these cues should be viewed as pieces of a larger puzzle rather than isolated signs of honesty or deceit.

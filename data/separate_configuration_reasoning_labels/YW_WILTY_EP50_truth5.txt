The person’s gaze directed downward can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on the broader context. On one hand, looking down might suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which can be associated with feelings of guilt or the desire to conceal falsehoods. This behavior might indicate that the individual is internally wrestling with the information they are presenting, possibly fabricating details or withholding the full truth. On the other hand, gaze aversion can also be a natural response rooted in cultural norms or personal habits, and it does not inherently signal deception. People often look down while thinking, reflecting, or processing emotions such as sadness or embarrassment, none of which necessarily imply dishonesty. Therefore, while the downward gaze could be a subtle cue pointing to possible deceit, it equally can be a benign and truthful expression of introspection or emotional discomfort. Additional behavioral cues and situational context would be essential to draw a more informed conclusion regarding their truthfulness.

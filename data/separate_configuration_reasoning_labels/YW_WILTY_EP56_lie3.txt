The subject’s behavior includes raising their eyebrows, which can be seen as a sign of surprise or emphasis when conveying information, potentially indicating honesty and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also serve as a subtle attempt to exaggerate or feign sincerity, possibly signaling an effort to manipulate the listener’s perception. Their consistent gaze toward the interlocutor could suggest openness and confidence in what they are communicating, often interpreted as a hallmark of truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can also be consciously maintained to distract or convince the listener, thus not excluding the possibility of deception.

Nodding during conversation is generally associated with active listening and agreement, reinforcing the impression that the person is being truthful and cooperative. Yet, nodding can also be a learned social behavior intended to create rapport or encourage the interlocutor while the speaker consciously formulates a deceptive narrative. The display of palms facing upwards is frequently interpreted as a gesture of honesty and vulnerability, implying that the individual has nothing to hide. On the flip side, this gesture might be strategically employed to project openness and disarm suspicion, regardless of the actual truthfulness of the message.

Each of these behaviors holds dual interpretive potential, highlighting the necessity of considering the broader context, baseline behavior, and other verbal and nonverbal cues before drawing any conclusions about the person’s veracity. Without such a holistic perspective, these gestures remain ambiguous indicators that can support both truthful and deceptive interpretations.

The person’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, the furrowing of the brow might suggest cognitive effort or discomfort, potentially indicating they are struggling to maintain a fabricated narrative or experiencing internal conflict related to deception. Conversely, this same expression could simply reflect genuine concentration or concern regarding the topic being discussed, without any implication of dishonesty.

Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows can carry dual meanings. Raised eyebrows might signify surprise or disbelief, which could be a sign of someone reacting defensively to being questioned, possibly to mask deceit. However, they could equally represent genuine emotional responses, such as curiosity or attentiveness, highlighting engagement in the conversation rather than deceitful intent.

Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor is another behavior that can be interpreted through different lenses. Direct eye contact might indicate confidence and sincerity, suggesting the person is truthful and open. Alternatively, intense or prolonged eye contact may be a deliberate attempt to project honesty and control, potentially masking deceptive motives. The broader conversational context and cultural norms regarding eye contact would provide valuable insight into the appropriateness and meaning of this behavior.

Finally, the individual’s head shaking introduces further ambiguity. This gesture might reflect denial or disagreement, which could be consistent with an attempt to refute accusal or mislead. On the other hand, it could merely signal genuine negation or a natural response to information being processed, devoid of any deceptive undertones.

Given these nuanced behaviors, it is essential to consider the broader context—including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors—to form a more accurate assessment of truthfulness or deception. Each of these signals alone is insufficient to conclusively indicate either state, underscoring the importance of comprehensive and holistic analysis.

The individual’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor can be seen from multiple perspectives. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest honesty and engagement, indicating they are confident in their statements and willing to maintain a connection. Conversely, intense or prolonged gaze could also be a deliberate strategy to assert dominance or distract the listener, potentially masking deceit. Their head shaking introduces a similar duality in interpretation. It could serve as a genuine nonverbal denial, reinforcing that they disagree or negate something, aligning with truthful communication. On the other hand, head shaking might be an unconscious or deliberate gesture to deflect suspicion or express uncertainty in an attempt to mislead. The openness of their arms adds another layer of complexity; open arms are traditionally associated with openness and receptivity, implying transparency and honesty in their demeanor. However, this gesture may also be employed as a calculated display to create an appearance of sincerity, effectively serving as a façade to conceal deceptive intentions. Ultimately, these behavioral cues require careful consideration within the broader context of the interaction, as each can plausibly support interpretations of both truthfulness and deception.

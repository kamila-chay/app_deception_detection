The subject maintains direct gaze toward the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, sustained eye contact may suggest confidence and openness, indicative of someone who is being truthful and comfortable in the interaction. It can signal engagement and a desire to connect honestly with the other person. Conversely, intentional gaze toward the interlocutor might be a strategic effort to establish credibility, as some individuals who are deceptive might overcompensate by maintaining strong eye contact to appear sincere. In this sense, their gaze could be rehearsed or forced rather than genuine. Without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, the significance of the direct gaze remains ambiguous, as it can equally reflect honesty or calculated emphasis, and should be weighed alongside a broader pattern of verbal and nonverbal signals to form a more grounded judgment.

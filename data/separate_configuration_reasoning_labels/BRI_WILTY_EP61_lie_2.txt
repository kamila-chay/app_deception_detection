The subject’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways: it might signal genuine warmth and confidence, suggesting honesty, or it could be a strategic attempt to appear more credible and disarm suspicion. Similarly, their raised eyebrows can convey openness and engagement, which supports truthful communication, yet in some cases, raised eyebrows serve as an exaggerated expression designed to elicit empathy or divert attention from inconsistencies. The fact that their mouth remains closed might indicate careful thoughtfulness, reflecting a desire to choose words precisely, which can be consistent with truthfulness. Conversely, a closed mouth might also suggest restraint or discomfort, potentially hinting at withholding information or concealing deception. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor typically demonstrates attentiveness and sincerity, but in certain contexts, it might be a conscious effort to maintain control of the interaction and project honesty despite underlying deceit. Likewise, the act of head tilting could be an involuntary sign of curiosity and genuine interest, reinforcing credibility; on the flip side, it might be used to feign empathy or to subtly manipulate the emotional tone of the conversation. Finally, the display of palms up is often associated with openness and vulnerability, reinforcing perceptions of truthfulness; yet, this gesture can also be employed intentionally to create a facade of transparency, masking any deceptive intent. Without additional context, these behaviors leave room for interpretation in both directions, underscoring the need for a broader assessment to distinguish between authenticity and possible deception.

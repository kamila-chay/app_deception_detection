The individual maintains direct gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often suggests confidence and sincerity, indicating that the person is comfortable and truthful in the interaction. It may reflect an openness and willingness to engage honestly. On the other hand, deliberate and prolonged eye contact can also be a conscious strategy employed to mask deception, aiming to convey credibility and distract from dishonesty. Without additional context, this behavior alone is not definitive.

Simultaneously, the person has their arms folded, which similarly invites dual interpretations. This posture is sometimes perceived as a defensive or closed-off signal, potentially pointing to discomfort, resistance, or a subconscious barrier erected when one is being deceptive or withholding information. However, folded arms can equally be a sign of self-soothing or simply a habitual resting position, devoid of any deceptive intent. It could also indicate that the person is critically processing the conversation or feeling cold, rather than trying to hide something.

Ultimately, both the direct gaze and folded arms offer cues that can be construed as either truthful candor or guarded deception. The broader situational context, alongside other behavioral and verbal signals, is essential to accurately discern their meaning and reach a more informed conclusion.

The subject smiles and their lip corners turn upward, which could be interpreted as a genuine expression of positive emotion or comfort, suggesting honesty and openness in the interaction. However, this same smile might also be a practiced gesture intended to mask true feelings or to manipulate the interlocutor, potentially signaling deception. Their gaze remains directed toward the interlocutor, which often conveys engagement, confidence, and sincerity. Yet, sustained eye contact can sometimes be consciously maintained by someone attempting to appear truthful and avoid suspicion when fabricating information. Conversely, it might genuinely reflect their attentiveness and willingness to communicate transparently. Given these behaviors, the interpretation depends greatly on the broader context, such as the individual's baseline mannerisms, the content of their communication, and the situational dynamics, all of which would be essential to make a more confident assessment regarding their truthfulness.

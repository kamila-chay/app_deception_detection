The individual’s raised eyebrows may suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, which often accompanies truthful communication. Conversely, raised eyebrows could also be a deliberate tactic to appear open or innocent, potentially masking deceit. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might be interpreted as a sign of confidence and sincerity, indicating transparency in the interaction. However, sustained eye contact could also be a conscious effort to appear convincing, as deceptive individuals sometimes overcompensate by maintaining exaggerated eye contact. The behaviors involving hands touching the head or body could be signs of nervousness or discomfort, possibly reflecting internal conflict related to deception. Yet, such gestures might simply be habitual or a response to environmental stimuli, unrelated to truthfulness. Similarly, the gesture of palms facing upward and arms open is often associated with openness and honesty, symbolizing an inviting and non-threatening posture. On the other hand, these welcoming gestures might be consciously employed to build trust and deflect suspicion. Without additional contextual information, each behavior remains ambiguous and can be reasonably interpreted in support of both truthful and deceptive intentions.

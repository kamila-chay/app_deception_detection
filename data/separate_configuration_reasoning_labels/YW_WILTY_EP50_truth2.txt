The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest openness and engagement, potentially indicating honesty and a willingness to communicate transparently. Conversely, sustained eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate attempt to convince or manipulate, which might hint at deceptive intent depending on the context. Their occasional gaze downward could be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or evasiveness, commonly associated with someone concealing information or feeling guilty. On the other hand, looking down can also reflect contemplation or internal processing, where the person is gathering their thoughts to provide a considered and truthful response. The head tilting could be seen as a sign of curiosity or attentiveness, suggesting genuine interest in the conversation and sincerity in their communication. However, the same behavior might also be a subtle cue to mask uncertainty or to appear more agreeable while fabricating details. Ultimately, these behaviors on their own are ambiguous and must be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction and additional indicators to form a more conclusive judgment about the subject’s truthfulness.

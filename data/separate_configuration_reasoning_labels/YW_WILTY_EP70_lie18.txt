The subject’s behavior of maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, steady eye contact often suggests confidence and honesty, as they appear engaged and open to communication. Conversely, it could also be an intentional effort to avoid suspicion by overcompensating, as some people who are deceptive may consciously try to maintain eye contact to appear truthful. Similarly, their occasional shifts to gaze downward may signal discomfort or hesitation, potentially hinting at internal conflict or attempts to conceal information. However, looking down can also be a natural moment of reflection or thoughtfulness, rather than a sign of deceit, especially in a complex or emotionally charged conversation. The subject’s nodding serves as another nuanced behavior—nodding might indicate agreement and cooperation, reinforcing the perception of sincerity. On the other hand, it could be a deliberate strategy to placate the interlocutor or feign understanding without genuine assent. Ultimately, these behaviors each carry dual interpretations, and without broader contextual information, it is challenging to definitively categorize the subject as truthful or deceptive based solely on these observable cues.

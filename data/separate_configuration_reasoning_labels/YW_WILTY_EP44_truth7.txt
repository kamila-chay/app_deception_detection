The individual’s expressions of frowning eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, the furrowed brows might suggest discomfort or stress, which could align with the cognitive load often experienced when someone is attempting to deceive. Conversely, frowning might simply reflect concentration or confusion about the topic at hand, rather than any intent to mislead. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows introduces ambiguity. Raised eyebrows can be a sign of surprise or incredulity, possibly indicating that the person is fabricating a story and trying to convey convincing emotions. Alternatively, this gesture may stem from genuine astonishment or an effort to engage more with the interlocutor sincerely.

The subject’s directed gaze toward the interlocutor is another behavior open to interpretation. Maintaining eye contact might indicate confidence and honesty, suggesting that the person has nothing to hide and is fully engaged in the dialogue. On the other hand, deliberate eye contact can sometimes be a strategy to appear credible and distract from deceptive intentions. The occasional gaze shifting sideways adds further complexity: looking away can signal evasiveness or discomfort that might stem from deceit, or it could simply reflect the natural process of trying to recall information or manage social dynamics during a conversation. Ultimately, these behaviors, in isolation, present a dual-edged narrative. Without additional context—such as the topic’s sensitivity, baseline behavior, or physiological cues—drawing a definitive conclusion about truthfulness or deception remains challenging and warrants cautious interpretation.

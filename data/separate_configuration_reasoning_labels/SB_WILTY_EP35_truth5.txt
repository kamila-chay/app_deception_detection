The individual’s raised eyebrows could signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and honesty. Conversely, this same gesture might be a calculated effort to feign innocence or manipulate the listener’s perception. Their lips being retracted could indicate tension or discomfort, potentially hinting at underlying deceit; yet, this expression could also simply reflect concentration or an emotional reaction unrelated to deception. The upward movement of the chin might be interpreted as a display of confidence or assertiveness, which can reinforce the credibility of their statements. On the other hand, it might be a defensive or dismissive posture aimed at concealing uncertainty or evading scrutiny. Similarly, the chin moving downward could be a sign of submission or humility, possibly underlining truthful remorse or regret; alternatively, it could mask reluctance or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation, which might raise suspicion.

Their gaze shifting upwards might indicate cognitive processing or attempting to reconstruct memories truthfully, but it could also be a sign of disengagement or mentally fabricating information. A downward gaze might reflect introspection and truthfulness, or it could suggest avoidance and discomfort associated with deception. Sideways glances may be interpreted as cautiousness and attentiveness, perhaps signaling careful thought in recounting genuine experiences. However, such glances might equally indicate evasiveness or a desire to find a convenient narrative. The subject’s head turning to the side can convey openness and engagement or, alternatively, reluctance to face the interlocutor directly, possibly suggesting concealment. Meanwhile, the head being held upright might demonstrate confidence and a readiness to communicate truthfully, though it could also be a deliberate posture to project credibility and mask internal deceit. Ultimately, understanding these behaviors in isolation is insufficient; a comprehensive interpretation relies heavily on additional contextual cues and baseline behavioral patterns.

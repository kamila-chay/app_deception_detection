The subject is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can be interpreted in two distinct ways depending on the context. On one hand, this may signal surprise or emphasis, potentially reflecting genuine emotional engagement or an attempt to appear more convincing. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or elicit sympathy when fabricating information, serving as a nonverbal cue to mask deceit. Their gaze directed toward the interlocutor also presents a dual-sided interpretation. Maintaining eye contact might indicate confidence and openness, traits commonly associated with truthfulness. However, it could equally represent heightened self-awareness or an effort to reinforce credibility while constructing a deceptive narrative. In contrast, moments when the subject looks down could suggest avoidance or discomfort, which some might associate with the cognitive load of deception or feelings of guilt. Yet, alternatively, downward gaze can simply be a natural response to emotional vulnerability, thoughtfulness, or cultural display norms, rather than an explicit sign of dishonesty. Lastly, the palms-up gesture adds another layer of complexity. This posture might be seen as a plea for understanding or an honest appeal, often linked to sincerity and openness. At the same time, it can be interpreted as a calculated display of vulnerability, aimed at manipulating the listener’s perception to mask untruths. Ultimately, these behaviors must be assessed within the broader context of the interaction and the individual's baseline mannerisms to draw a more reliable conclusion about their veracity.

The subject’s laughter can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, it might serve as a genuine expression of amusement or a natural conversational response, signaling comfort and openness. Conversely, laughter can sometimes function as a psychological defense mechanism, a way to deflect discomfort or mask underlying anxiety that may arise from fabricating information. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows might suggest surprise or genuine interest, indicating sincere engagement with the interlocutor. However, raised eyebrows can also be employed strategically to feign innocence or to emphasize incredulity, potentially casting doubt on the subject’s veracity.

The subtle upward movement of the lip corners often conveys friendliness and warmth, suggesting openness and positive intention. Yet, this expression can also be a deliberate attempt to appear more trustworthy, as a false smile might be used to influence the perception of honesty. Maintaining steady gaze towards the interlocutor is generally associated with sincerity and confidence, implying that the person has nothing to hide. At the same time, consistent eye contact can be consciously controlled and might be a tactic to assert credibility or distract from deceptive content. Ultimately, without additional contextual information such as baseline behaviors or the nature of the dialogue, these observed behaviors can justifiably be viewed both as indicators of truthfulness and as possible signs of deception.

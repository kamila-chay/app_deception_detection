The subject’s smile might be interpreted as a genuine expression of friendliness and openness, suggesting they are comfortable and truthful in the interaction. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate social mask used to disarm suspicion or delay detection, potentially signaling deception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor typically conveys engagement and honesty, as people tend to look at others when communicating sincerely. However, an intentional gaze can also be a tactic to appear credible and control the dynamic of the conversation, especially if maintained unnaturally. The momentary gaze upwards might indicate the subject is thoughtfully accessing memories, which supports the notion of truthful recall. Alternatively, looking up can be an internally generated construct or fabrication process, implying they may be creating rather than retrieving information. The subtle side-turn of the head can be seen as a sign of reflective consideration or an attempt to avoid confrontation while remaining attentive, which can be consistent with honest behavior. On the other hand, such a head movement might suggest discomfort or an unconscious attempt to physically distance themselves from the topic they find challenging to address truthfully. The open palms are often associated with openness and transparency, reinforcing a perception of sincerity. Yet, this gesture can be consciously employed to project innocence and deflect doubt, thus functioning as a potential indicator of deception. Finally, the posture with arms open typically communicates receptiveness and willingness to engage, which supports the interpretation of truthful interaction. Still, it may also be strategically adopted to mask underlying defensiveness or to manage impressions carefully in a setting where the subject feels pressured to appear honest. Ultimately, these behaviors, while informative, require careful consideration of contextual cues to draw more reliable conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

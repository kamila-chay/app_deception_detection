The individual’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor may suggest engagement and a desire to establish trust, which can be interpreted as a sign of honesty and openness. Maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and sincerity in communication. Conversely, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to project credibility and deflect suspicion, potentially indicating an effort to mask deceit. In some cases, individuals who are deceptive might overcompensate by maintaining unnaturally steady eye contact to avoid appearing evasive.

Similarly, the head tilting behavior can be read in multiple ways depending on context. Tilting the head might reflect active listening, curiosity, or empathy, which supports a narrative of genuine interest and truthful interaction. It may also convey a relaxed and open demeanor, reinforcing honest intentions. On the other hand, head tilting could be a subconscious signal of uncertainty or discomfort, which might arise when someone is fabricating information or feeling anxious about deception. It could also be a tactical gesture used to appear more approachable and non-threatening while concealing dishonesty.

Ultimately, these behaviors should be assessed within the broader context of the conversation, individual baseline conduct, and other verbal and nonverbal cues before arriving at a more definitive conclusion regarding the person’s truthfulness.

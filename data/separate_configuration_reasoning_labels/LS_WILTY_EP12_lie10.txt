The individual’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, suggesting openness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, it could also be a subtle cue of uncertainty or a rehearsed attempt to appear sincere, possibly masking discomfort associated with deception. Frequent blinking is another behavior that lends itself to dual interpretations. On one hand, it might reflect cognitive load or anxiety that often accompanies deception as the person strives to maintain a fabricated narrative. On the other hand, it could simply be a natural physiological response, possibly linked to environmental factors like lighting or dry eyes, rather than any emotional or psychological stress. 

Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor generally suggests confidence and a willingness to engage truthfully. Yet, this gaze can also be purposefully sustained as a technique to convince or manipulate, especially when paired with other behaviors that might indicate deception. In contrast, sideways glances may indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation, which can be seen as a defense mechanism by someone concealing information. However, such glances could equally be attributable to momentary distraction or the cognitive processing of complex information, which does not necessarily imply deceit. 

Nodding during the interaction may demonstrate active listening and agreement, reinforcing the perception of honesty and transparency. Alternatively, nodding could be strategically employed to create rapport or give false affirmation, thus potentially serving as a tactic to deceive. Similarly, movements of the head forward might be interpreted as eagerness or earnestness in conveying truthful information. Yet, this forward movement may also be a subtle indication of probing or attempting to convince the interlocutor, which might align with deceptive behavior. Meanwhile, the person pulling their head backward could be signaling discomfort or a subconscious distancing from their statements, possibly hinting at deceit. Contrastingly, such a gesture might simply express contemplation or the natural ebb and flow of communication dynamics. Finally, turning the head to the side might reflect doubt or evasiveness, which some theories link to deception attempts. Conversely, it can simply represent the individual's habitual mannerism or a way to gather thoughts before responding confidently.

Ultimately, these behaviors must be understood within a broader context that considers baseline patterns and additional verbal and non-verbal cues. Without such context, it is challenging to definitively ascribe truthfulness or deception based solely on these observable actions.

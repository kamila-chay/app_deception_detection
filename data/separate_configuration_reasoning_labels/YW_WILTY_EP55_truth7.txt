The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often conveys honesty and confidence, suggesting that the person is engaged and sincere in their communication. Conversely, intense or prolonged gaze might also be a deliberate effort to appear truthful, masking underlying deception or discomfort. Head shaking, commonly associated with disagreement or negation, similarly carries dual interpretations. It could genuinely reflect the subject’s refusal or denial of a statement, reinforcing their truthful stance. Alternatively, it might serve as a subtle, unconscious signal of internal conflict or disbelief in their own words, hinting at potential deception. The palms-up gesture adds further complexity; traditionally, open palms are linked to openness, honesty, and a willingness to share information, which supports the idea of truthfulness. However, this gesture could also be employed as a strategic display aimed at eliciting trust or sympathy, making it a potentially conscious attempt to convince or manipulate. In sum, each of these behaviors—gaze, head movement, and hand positioning—carries plausible explanations on both sides, underscoring the necessity of considering the broader context and additional cues before drawing conclusions about the individual’s veracity.

The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor might be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, maintaining direct eye contact can be a sign of honesty and confidence, suggesting they have nothing to hide and are fully engaged in the conversation. Conversely, such sustained eye contact may also be a calculated effort to convince or manipulate, as some individuals deliberately maintain strong eye contact to appear more credible when being deceptive. Similarly, the act of head tilting carries dual interpretations. It can signify openness and genuine interest, reflecting a thoughtful and attentive demeanor that fosters trust. Alternatively, head tilting might be employed as a subtle behavioral tactic to appear more sincere or empathetic, potentially masking underlying discomfort or uncertainty. Without additional contextual cues or baseline behavior, these gestures alone are insufficient to definitively conclude truthfulness or deception, emphasizing the need for a holistic assessment of the interaction.

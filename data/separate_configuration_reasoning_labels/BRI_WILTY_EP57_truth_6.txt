The subject’s lips are retracted, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, this expression might suggest discomfort or tension, potentially signaling that the individual is trying to withhold information or fabricate a story. Conversely, the lip retraction could simply be a spontaneous facial gesture unrelated to deception, possibly reflecting concentration or an emotional reaction to the conversation’s content.

Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which traditionally might indicate engagement and sincerity, as maintaining eye contact often aligns with truthful communication. However, it is also possible that sustained eye contact is deliberately employed to convince or manipulate the listener, thus serving as a strategic behavior rather than an authentic sign of honesty. 

At the same time, the subject occasionally looks sideways. This gaze shift might be interpreted as a sign of evasiveness or internal conflict, potentially revealing discomfort with the topic or an attempt to fabricate details. On the other hand, sideways glances can also be associated with cognitive processes involved in recalling memories or assessing the situation, suggesting thoughtfulness rather than deceit.

Ultimately, these behaviors—lip retraction, direct gaze, and sideways glances—possess a dual nature, with both truthfulness and deception providing plausible explanations. A nuanced interpretation requires consideration of additional verbal and contextual cues to more confidently discern the intent behind these actions.

The subject exhibits frequent blinking, a behavior that could be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, increased blinking might suggest heightened cognitive load or stress, which can be associated with attempts to fabricate information or conceal the truth. Conversely, frequent blinking may simply result from environmental factors such as dry eyes, lighting conditions, or natural physiological responses unrelated to deception. Their lip corners are turned up, signaling a smile or positive affect, which could indicate genuine engagement and comfort in the conversation, a sign often linked with truthfulness. However, this same behavior might also represent a socially strategic smile intended to mask discomfort or to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception, thus potentially serving as a subtle cue of deceit. Additionally, the subject maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that could signal honesty and confidence in what is being communicated, as direct eye contact is commonly interpreted as a marker of sincerity. Alternatively, sustained eye contact can also be consciously employed to overcompensate for dishonesty, aiming to appear credible and trustworthy, or it might simply reflect cultural norms or individual personality traits. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors should be carefully weighed in conjunction with contextual information and baseline behavior to form a more accurate assessment of truthfulness.

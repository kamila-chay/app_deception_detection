The subject’s gaze behavior presents a complex picture. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might suggest openness and confidence, often associated with truthfulness, as maintaining eye contact can imply a willingness to engage honestly. Conversely, such gaze could also be a deliberate effort to appear sincere and mask deceptive intent, with the individual consciously trying to convince or manipulate the listener. At times, the subject shifts their gaze downward, which may indicate discomfort or internal conflict often linked to deception, potentially reflecting an attempt to avoid direct confrontation while fabricating a response. However, this downward gaze could equally be interpreted as a natural moment of reflection or modesty, a pause to gather thoughts without any deceptive motivation.

The subject’s head shaking adds another layer of ambiguity. It might be a nonverbal cue of denial or disagreement, possibly signaling resistance to a truthful statement or deliberate negation that aligns with deception. On the other hand, head shaking can also be a spontaneous, genuine reaction expressing disbelief or correction based on honest conviction. In this light, such behavior does not necessarily denote deceit but rather a candid emotional response. Altogether, these behaviors must be considered within the broader communicative and contextual environment to approach an accurate assessment, as each action is open to multiple interpretations and cannot conclusively indicate truthfulness or deception on its own.

The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest confidence and a willingness to engage openly, potentially indicating honesty and straightforwardness in communication. It can convey attentiveness and sincerity, fostering trust between parties. On the other hand, this same focused gaze could also be a conscious effort to mask deceit, as some individuals overcompensate with eye contact to appear credible, knowing that avoiding eye contact is commonly associated with lying. Additionally, maintaining gaze might be a strategic attempt to control the interaction or to carefully monitor the listener’s reactions while fabricating a story. Ultimately, without supplementary information such as baseline behavior, verbal cues, or contextual factors, the gaze directed toward the interlocutor remains an ambiguous signal that could support interpretations of either truthfulness or deception.

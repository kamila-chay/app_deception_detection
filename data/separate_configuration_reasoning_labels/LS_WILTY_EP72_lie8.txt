The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest honesty and confidence, as they appear engaged and open, potentially indicating that they have nothing to hide. This steady gaze might be a sign of someone who is comfortable with the truth and is fully invested in the conversation. On the other hand, sustained eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy to appear convincing and trustworthy, especially if someone is attempting to mask deception. In some cases, individuals who are fabricating or withholding information may consciously maintain eye contact to avoid suspicion and project sincerity. Therefore, the meaning of their gaze largely depends on the broader context, including baseline behaviors and the nature of the interaction, making it essential to consider additional cues before drawing any firm conclusions about their truthfulness.

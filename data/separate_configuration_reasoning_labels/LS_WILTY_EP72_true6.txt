The person’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, raising the eyebrows may signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially indicating openness and truthfulness. Conversely, it might also serve as a subtle cue to mask discomfort or to feign innocence when fabricating information. The movement of the chin upwards similarly lends itself to multiple readings; it could reflect confidence and assertiveness in conveying truthful information, or alternatively, it might be a defensive gesture aimed at creating physical distance or shielding oneself from scrutiny during deception.

Their gaze behavior is equally ambiguous. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor may suggest engagement and honesty, reinforcing a perception of transparency. Yet, deliberate and prolonged gaze can also be a conscious strategy to overcompensate and convince the listener, which could hint at deception. Meanwhile, the combination of occasionally looking upward could indicate cognitive effort in recalling truthful details, as people often look upwards when accessing memories. However, the same upward gaze might reflect attempts to construct a fabricated narrative or to avoid direct visual connection when feeling uneasy about the veracity of their statements.

In sum, each of these behaviors—raising eyebrows, chin movement, and varied gaze directions—can be interpreted as either markers of truthfulness or deception depending heavily on the broader context, baseline behavior of the individual, and the specific circumstances surrounding the interaction. Without additional information, these cues remain suggestive rather than definitive indicators of honesty or deceit.

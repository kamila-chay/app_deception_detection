The person’s frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which could be interpreted as a sign of deception, potentially indicating they are struggling to maintain a fabricated narrative. Conversely, this expression might simply reflect genuine concern or confusion about the topic being discussed, signaling sincere engagement rather than deceit. Similarly, the action of raising eyebrows could signify surprise or disbelief, possibly revealing an attempt to feign innocence or deflect suspicion. On the other hand, raised eyebrows might genuinely express curiosity or attentiveness, suggesting that the individual is processing information honestly. The head shaking presents another ambiguous cue; it might indicate denial or rejection, which could be a defensive reaction employed during deception. Conversely, it could be a natural, spontaneous response conveying disagreement or the negation of a false assertion, consistent with truthful communication. Ultimately, these behaviors must be evaluated within the broader context of verbal cues and situational factors to more accurately assess their significance.

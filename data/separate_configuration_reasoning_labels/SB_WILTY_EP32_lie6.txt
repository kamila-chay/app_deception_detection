The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor suggests engagement and openness, which could signal honesty and a willingness to communicate transparently. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear convincing and mask deceit, as some individuals overcompensate by holding eye contact to avoid suspicion. When the subject looks down, this behavior might indicate discomfort or reluctance to face the topic, potentially hinting at concealment or hesitation associated with deception. Conversely, looking down can be a natural moment of reflection or processing information, not necessarily linked to dishonesty. The intermittent sideways gaze could be interpreted as evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct questioning, possibly revealing internal conflict or fabricated responses. Yet, it might equally reflect distraction, nervousness, or simply searching for the right words, especially under the pressure of the situation. Head tilting often denotes curiosity or active listening, which may support the interpretation of sincerity and openness. On the other hand, head tilting might serve as a subconscious effort to appear empathetic or trustworthy when the person is, in fact, concealing information. The fact that the subject’s arms are open can be perceived as a sign of receptiveness and transparency, consistent with truthful communication. Still, open arms might also be a calculated posture aimed at projecting confidence and reducing suspicion, even if the individual is being deceptive. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors hinges on the broader context, including baseline behavior, the nature of the conversation, and other nonverbal cues, making it difficult to definitively conclude truthfulness or deception based solely on these observations.

The individual’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be interpreted in different ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, a genuine smile, often accompanied by natural lip corner movement, may suggest sincerity and comfort in the interaction. However, it could also be a carefully controlled display meant to mask true feelings or to appear agreeable while providing deceptive information. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows might convey openness or a positive engagement with the interlocutor, yet it could equally be a deliberate gesture to feign surprise or innocence, potentially signaling deceit.

Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor is another behavior that holds dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact is traditionally seen as a sign of honesty and confidence. Nonetheless, some individuals consciously sustain eye contact when being untruthful to avoid suspicion or to enhance the credibility of their narrative. Conversely, palms being turned upwards often symbolize openness and a willingness to share information, which might indicate honesty. Yet, this gesture can also be strategically employed to portray vulnerability or trustworthiness, possibly as a means of manipulation.

Ultimately, each observed behavior could be a natural expression of truthfulness or a calculated maneuver to deceive, depending greatly on the broader context of the interaction and the individual's baseline mannerisms. Only by considering these elements in conjunction with other verbal and nonverbal cues can a more accurate judgment be formed.

The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which aligns with truthful communication. On the other hand, raised eyebrows can sometimes be a deliberate effort to feign openness or engage the listener, potentially masking deceit. Similarly, the movement of the chin both upwards and downwards presents a dual interpretation. A chin lifted might reflect confidence or assertiveness, consistent with someone telling the truth. Conversely, it could be a subtle sign of defensiveness or an attempt to project authority when fabricating information. The downward movement of the chin can indicate submission or reflection, which might be genuine contemplation, or it could betray unease and a desire to avoid direct confrontation when being deceptive.

The subject’s gaze patterns are equally ambiguous. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor often suggests honesty and engagement, yet it can also be a rehearsed effort to convince others of one’s truthfulness. Looking downward might signal recall of memories or modesty, but alternatively, it could be an evasion tactic to avoid scrutiny. The side-turning of the head can demonstrate openness to new perspectives or simply be a nonverbal way to communicate thoughtfulness. Conversely, it might reflect discomfort or a subconscious attempt to distance oneself from the topic, hinting at possible concealment. Ultimately, these behaviors require careful consideration of the broader context, baseline behaviors, and additional cues before reaching any reliable conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

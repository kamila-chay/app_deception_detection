The subject’s smile and the upward turn of their lip corners could be seen as signs of genuine friendliness and openness, suggesting they are comfortable and truthful in the interaction. However, these same expressions might also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to manipulate the listener into perceiving sincerity, thus potentially indicating deception. Their lips protruding may signal contemplation or hesitation, which could mean they are carefully considering their words to be honest, yet it might equally suggest that they are fabricating or withholding information. The downward gaze might be interpreted as a natural gesture of shyness or humility, lending credibility to their truthfulness, or conversely, it might be a way to avoid eye contact to conceal dishonesty. Head tilting and side-turning can convey engagement and empathy, reinforcing the perception of authenticity, but these movements might also be conscious efforts to appear more convincing and to deflect suspicion. Lastly, the open arms could reflect openness and a willingness to communicate transparently, indicating truthfulness, or they could be a calculated posture to project confidence and reduce perceived threats, which might be employed by someone being deceptive. Ultimately, without considering the broader context, these behaviors can support dual interpretations, emphasizing the need for additional cues to arrive at a more reliable conclusion.

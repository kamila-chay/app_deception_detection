They are raising their eyebrows during the interaction, a behavior that could suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, as raised eyebrows often accompany genuine reactions or engagement. Conversely, this same action might be interpreted as a sign of fabricated disbelief or an effort to manipulate the listener’s perception, potentially indicating deception. Their gaze shifts sideways, which in some contexts could reflect discomfort, evasiveness, or a subconscious attempt to avoid direct confrontation when reconstructing an untruthful narrative. However, alternating eye contact and looking sideways can also be a natural response stemming from cognitive processing, such as trying to recall specific memories or carefully choosing words, which supports the possibility of truthfulness. Without additional contextual cues or baseline behavioral information, these gestures alone provide ambiguous signals that could equally support interpretations of honesty or deceit.

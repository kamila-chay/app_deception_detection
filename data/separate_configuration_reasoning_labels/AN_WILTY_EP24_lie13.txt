The person’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways; it might suggest a genuine attempt to convey warmth and sincerity, which aligns with truthful communication. Conversely, the smile could be a deliberate social mask, employed to deflect suspicion or mask discomfort during deception. When they raise their eyebrows, it might indicate a natural expression of surprise or engagement, reinforcing openness. However, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle cue to exaggerate emotions or create emphasis, potentially signaling an attempt to manipulate the listener’s perception. The upward movement of the chin often conveys confidence or assertiveness, which could point to truthfulness and conviction in their statements. Alternatively, such a gesture might be a defensive posture or an unconscious attempt to project dominance, possibly compensating for underlying uncertainty associated with deceit.

Their gaze toward the interlocutor generally reflects attentiveness and willingness to connect, traits consistent with honesty. Yet, sustained eye contact can also be consciously maintained as a strategy to appear credible, even when untruthful. The subsequent upward gaze introduces another layer of complexity; it may signify cognitive processing or an effort to recall accurate information, supporting the notion of truthful reflection. On the other hand, glancing upwards can sometimes indicate fabrication or disengagement from the immediate social interaction, a subtle sign of constructing falsehoods. Finally, the head side-turn could represent openness and active listening, indicative of genuine engagement. Alternatively, it might signal discomfort, evasiveness, or an attempt to distance oneself psychologically from the narrative being presented, which could be associated with deception. Ultimately, without additional context, these behaviors alone cannot definitively confirm or refute the person’s truthfulness, and each gesture should be interpreted within the broader interactional framework.

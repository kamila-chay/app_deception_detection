The subject’s gaze behavior presents a complex picture that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest openness and engagement, often associated with honesty and confidence. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate effort to appear truthful, masking underlying deception. When the subject looks down, this could indicate discomfort or insecurity often linked with concealing information, yet it might equally reflect genuine reflection or modesty in the context of the conversation. Similarly, their sideways glances might be perceived as attempts to avoid direct scrutiny or as a sign of evasiveness, potentially hinting at fabrication. Conversely, these glances might simply signal the subject’s cognitive processing, such as searching memory or evaluating their response. Ultimately, without additional context or corroborative cues, these behaviors remain ambiguous, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach when assessing truthfulness or deceit.

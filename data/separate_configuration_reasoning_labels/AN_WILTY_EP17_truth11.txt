The subject’s chin moving upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might suggest a subtle display of defensiveness or an attempt to assert dominance, which could be consistent with deceptive behavior aimed at masking uncertainty. Conversely, it could simply be a natural posture reflecting confidence or engagement in the conversation, making it an inconclusive indicator on its own.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor is notable as well. Maintaining eye contact might signal sincerity and openness, suggesting the subject is truthful and genuinely involved in the exchange. However, steady eye contact could also be a deliberate effort to appear convincing or to control the interaction, which are behaviors sometimes associated with deception.

The moments when the subject’s gaze shifts downward further complicate the interpretation. Looking down can be seen as a sign of discomfort or avoidance, potentially hinting at concealment or cognitive load related to fabricating information. Alternatively, it might simply reflect a moment of reflection or gathering thoughts, indicating honesty as they carefully consider their response.

Head movements add another layer of ambiguity. Moving the head forward may indicate eagerness or a desire to emphasize a point, which can be interpreted as genuine enthusiasm or a deliberate effort to persuade. When the head turns to the side, it may suggest uncertainty or hesitation, possibly aligning with deceptive hesitation; yet, it could also be a natural reaction to processing complex information or engaging with a secondary stimulus, not necessarily implying deceit.

Finally, the subject’s open arms posture typically signals openness and receptivity, often associated with transparency and honesty. On the flip side, open arms may be employed strategically to appear non-threatening and trustworthy, serving as a nonverbal tactic to disarm suspicion, which could support the possibility of deception.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors can be read in multiple ways depending on the broader context, including the subject’s baseline demeanor and the nature of the conversation. Without additional contextual information, these signals remain ambiguous and should be interpreted with caution.

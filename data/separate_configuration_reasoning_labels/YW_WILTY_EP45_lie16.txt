The person’s smile, combined with the lip corners turned up, can be seen as a sign of genuine friendliness and openness, suggesting they are comfortable and sincere in their communication. However, in the context of deception, such smiles might be carefully controlled or rehearsed, potentially masking true feelings or attempting to persuade the interlocutor by appearing agreeable. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor often conveys engagement and honesty, as sustained eye contact is typically associated with trustworthiness; yet, it could also be a deliberate strategy to feign confidence and distract from underlying deceit.

The presence of frowning eyebrows introduces complexity to this interpretation. Frowning may indicate concern, uncertainty, or discomfort, which could stem from the stress of fabricating information or masking the truth. Conversely, it could simply reflect concentration or a genuine emotional response to the topic at hand, unrelated to deception. Meanwhile, the raised eyebrows might connote surprise or a desire to emphasize honesty and openness, reinforcing trust. Yet, they could also be exaggerated gestures intended to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception or to simulate truthfulness.

Their open arms posture further lends itself to dual interpretations. Open arms often symbolize receptiveness and vulnerability, traits consistent with honest communication. On the other hand, this stance might be consciously adopted to project approachability and disarm suspicion, especially if the individual is aware they are being evaluated for credibility. Ultimately, each of these behaviors—smiling, eyebrow movements, eye contact, and body posture—must be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction and other cues to draw a more reliable conclusion about the person’s truthfulness or potential deception.

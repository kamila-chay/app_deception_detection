The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners may initially suggest friendliness and openness, which are often associated with truthful communication. However, smiles can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to appear more convincing when fabricating information. The gaze directed towards the interlocutor might indicate engagement and honesty, as maintaining eye contact is frequently perceived as a sign of sincerity. Conversely, intentional eye contact can be used manipulatively to create a sense of trust, or it might be sustained out of social convention rather than genuine transparency.

The act of shaking the head adds complexity to the interpretation. This gesture could reflect genuine disagreement or a truthful denial, reinforcing the credibility of the person’s statements. Yet, in another light, head shaking might be a subconscious attempt to distance oneself from the content being discussed or to deflect scrutiny, hinting at possible deception. Similarly, the open positioning of the arms might be read as a nonverbal cue of openness and receptivity, signaling readiness to communicate honestly. Alternatively, this posture can be a deliberate tactic to project confidence and to discourage suspicion, even if the underlying message is not truthful.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors can lend themselves to both honest and deceptive interpretations depending on the broader context, including baseline behavior, the nature of the discussion, and other environmental cues. Without additional information, it remains equally plausible that the subject is being straightforward or is subtly managing their nonverbal signals to deceive.

The individual displays lip corners turned downward, a subtle expression that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this facial cue might suggest discomfort or sadness, potentially arising from the stress of concealing information or fabricating a response. Alternatively, it could simply reflect a natural resting expression or momentary emotional state unrelated to deception, such as concentration or fatigue. Concurrently, the person maintains gaze directed toward the interlocutor, which again allows for dual interpretations. Prolonged eye contact might indicate sincerity and confidence, as the person openly engages with the questioner without evasiveness. Conversely, such gaze could be strategically employed to convince or manipulate, with the individual consciously holding eye contact to mask underlying deceit. In either case, these behaviors are context-dependent, and without further information about the conversation dynamics, baseline behaviors, or emotional triggers, it remains challenging to definitively categorize the person’s truthfulness or deception.

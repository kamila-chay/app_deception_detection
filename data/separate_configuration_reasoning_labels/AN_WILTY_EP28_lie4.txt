The individual’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might suggest genuine friendliness and openness, which are often associated with truthfulness. However, smiles can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to create a false sense of ease, potentially signaling deception. Their act of raising eyebrows could be interpreted as a natural expression of surprise or engagement, but equally, it might be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or deflect suspicion. Direct gaze towards the interlocutor generally indicates confidence and willingness to communicate truthfully, yet sustained eye contact can sometimes be consciously maintained to convince or manipulate. Conversely, the gaze shifting upwards might reflect cognitive effort in retrieving truthful memories, but it might also imply fabrication or evasiveness as the person constructs a story. The head shaking could denote genuine disagreement or disbelief, yet in another light, it may be a rehearsed gesture to reinforce the falsehood being presented. Finally, the “palms up” gesture often conveys openness and honesty, but it may also be employed as a deliberate signal to persuade and elicit trust. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors hinges on the broader context and the congruence of these signals with verbal content and baseline behavioral patterns, highlighting the necessity for a comprehensive assessment before drawing conclusions regarding deception.

The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways; maintaining eye contact might suggest sincerity and engagement, reflecting confidence and openness in the conversation. Conversely, in certain contexts, this direct gaze could be a deliberate attempt to appear truthful while masking underlying deceit, aiming to convince the listener through confident nonverbal signals. Their moments of looking down similarly offer dual interpretations. This behavior might indicate discomfort or contemplation, perhaps as a natural reaction during a thoughtful exchange. Alternatively, avoiding eye contact by looking down could signal evasion or an effort to conceal information, depending on the situation and prior behavioral patterns.

The subject’s use of open palms can be read as a classic gesture of honesty and transparency, symbolizing a readiness to communicate openly without hiding anything. However, this gesture can also be strategically employed to create an illusion of trustworthiness, serving as a nonverbal cue meant to persuade or disarm skepticism. Similarly, the open position of their arms may reflect receptivity and a relaxed demeanor, indicating a willingness to engage sincerely. Yet, such openness might also be consciously adopted to project confidence and openness, potentially masking inner tension or deception. Given these ambiguous signals, a comprehensive understanding of the overall context and additional behavioral cues is essential before drawing a firm conclusion about the subject’s truthfulness.

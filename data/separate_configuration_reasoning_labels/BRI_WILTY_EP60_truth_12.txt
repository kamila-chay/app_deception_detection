The subject maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, steady eye contact might suggest confidence and a desire to be transparent, signaling openness and honesty. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate effort to appear truthful and to control the impression they are making, potentially masking deceit. When the subject’s gaze shifts upwards, this behavior may indicate they are accessing internal thoughts or memories, which could mean they are genuinely trying to recall information. However, upward glances are sometimes associated with fabrication, as individuals might look away to construct a story or disengage from direct interaction to avoid detection of dishonesty. Additionally, sideways glances present an equally ambiguous cue; they might reflect momentary distraction or thoughtfulness as the person processes the conversation. On the flip side, such glances can be interpreted as evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct scrutiny, suggesting discomfort with the topic or possible deceit. Ultimately, these gaze behaviors can signify either truthfulness or deception depending on the broader context, including the content of their speech, baseline behaviors, and situational factors, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive evaluation before drawing conclusions.

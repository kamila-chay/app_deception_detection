The individual’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways; they might express surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, signaling openness and engagement. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also be a subtle cue of skepticism or feigned astonishment, possibly used to distract or soften the impact of a deceptive statement. The downward movement of the chin can similarly bear dual interpretations. It could denote contemplation or a moment of humility, suggesting the person is thoughtfully processing the conversation and being sincere. On the other hand, this gesture might indicate an effort to conceal emotions, signaling discomfort or a desire to create distance from the subject at hand, which could be indicative of deception.

Their gaze shifting between looking directly at the interlocutor and then downward is also ambiguous. Maintaining eye contact often establishes trust and sincerity, showing confidence and transparency. However, a direct gaze can sometimes be deliberately maintained to convince or manipulate, while looking down might reflect submission or self-reflection, yet it could equally indicate evasiveness or an attempt to avoid scrutiny. The presence of nodding can reinforce the impression of agreement and attentiveness, suggesting the person is aligned and truthful. Nevertheless, nodding may also function as a social tool to placate or hasten the conversation, potentially masking insincerity.

Lastly, the tilting of the head can be viewed as a sign of empathy, openness, and active engagement, which strengthens the perception of honesty. Conversely, it might be a calculated gesture aimed at eliciting sympathy or softening the listener’s stance, thus serving as a subtle mechanism to deflect suspicion. Ultimately, these behaviors should be considered in the broader context of verbal content, baseline behavior, and the environment to arrive at a more informed assessment of truthfulness or deception.

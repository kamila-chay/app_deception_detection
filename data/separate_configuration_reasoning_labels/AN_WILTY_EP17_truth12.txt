The subject’s lips are protruded, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, this lip posture might suggest tension or frustration, potentially indicating discomfort that arises when someone is being less than truthful. It could also be a subconscious attempt to withhold information or control verbal expression. Conversely, protruding the lips could simply be a habitual or neutral facial expression, unrelated to any deception. It might be a natural way of speaking or reacting to the conversation’s emotional tone without implying dishonesty. 

The subject is also maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior traditionally associated with sincerity and engagement. Steady eye contact can signal openness and confidence, characteristics typically aligned with truthful communication. However, it is important to recognize that deliberate gaze maintenance can also be a learned strategy to mask deceit, as individuals who fabricate stories often attempt to appear convincing by holding eye contact. Furthermore, cultural and individual differences play a significant role in eye contact patterns, meaning that direct gaze does not universally equate to honesty.

Given these observations, it is essential to consider the surrounding context, baseline behaviors, and other nonverbal cues before drawing conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness. Both lip protrusion and gaze direction are subtle signals that carry ambiguous meanings and can support opposing interpretations depending on the overall communicative environment.

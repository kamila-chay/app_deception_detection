The individual maintains gaze towards their interlocutor, which can be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, steady eye contact often conveys confidence and openness, suggesting they have nothing to hide and are likely being truthful. It may demonstrate engagement and sincerity in the conversation. Conversely, prolonged or intense gaze can also be a deliberate attempt to assert control or manipulate the impression they give, potentially serving as a strategy to mask deception. The gaze might be used to compensate for nervousness by overcorrecting typical avoidance behaviors. The occasional upward gaze similarly presents a dual interpretation. From one perspective, looking upward can indicate cognitive processing or recalling information, supporting the idea that the person is thoughtfully retrieving truthful details. However, this behavior might also signal discomfort or attempts to distance themselves mentally from what is being said, possibly indicating evasion or fabrication. Without additional contextual cues, such as baseline behavior patterns or emotional responses, these eye movements alone do not conclusively reveal intent, but rather open multiple avenues for interpretation regarding truthfulness or deceit.

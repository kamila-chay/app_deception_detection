The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could be seen as a sign of genuine engagement and positive emotional expression, suggesting openness and honesty in their communication. Conversely, this same smile might be consciously employed as a social tool to mask discomfort or to project sincerity, potentially serving as a deliberate attempt to mislead or soften the impact of deceptive statements. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor may indicate attentiveness and confidence, traits commonly associated with truthful interactions. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a strategic behavior, consciously maintained to build trust and deflect suspicion when someone is fabricating information. Meanwhile, the occasional gaze directed upward introduces an additional layer of ambiguity. This upward gaze may reflect the cognitive effort involved in retrieving accurate memories or processing truthful information, thereby supporting the notion of honesty. On the other hand, it might be interpreted as a sign of mental construction or evasion, where the individual is looking away to mentally fabricate or manipulate details. Ultimately, these behaviors must be interpreted within the broader context of the interaction, as each can equally support arguments for both truthfulness and deception.

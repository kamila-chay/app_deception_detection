The individual’s raised eyebrows might be an expression of surprise or emphasis, which could suggest genuine engagement and honesty. Conversely, such an expression can also serve as a subtle attempt to feign openness or innocence, potentially masking deceit. Their chin moving downward could indicate contemplation or uncertainty, possibly reflecting thoughtfulness in providing truthful answers. However, it might equally signal hesitation or a subconscious effort to conceal discomfort linked to dishonesty. Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often conveys confidence and sincerity, yet it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear truthful and avoid raising suspicion. The occasional gaze sideways might imply distraction or searching for information, either as a natural part of recalling facts or as a sign of evasion and mental calculation when fabricating responses.

Nodding can demonstrate agreement and active listening, reinforcing the impression of honesty, but it might also be an automatic or rehearsed gesture designed to encourage trust or mask insincerity. The movement of the head backward might suggest defensiveness or attempts to physically distance oneself, which could be interpreted as discomfort stemming from deceit. Alternatively, such a posture might simply indicate surprise or a reaction to new information without any deceptive intent. A head side-turn could signal reluctance or avoidance, potentially indicating evasiveness, yet it could just as well be a habitual gesture or a way to process thoughts. Finally, folded arms might be perceived as a protective posture denoting defensiveness or concealment, possibly hinting at deception. On the other hand, the same gesture can signify comfort or self-soothing in a social situation, devoid of any intent to mislead.

Without further contextual cues, each of these behaviors might be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways, highlighting the importance of considering the broader communicative and situational framework before drawing conclusions about the individual’s truthfulness or deception.

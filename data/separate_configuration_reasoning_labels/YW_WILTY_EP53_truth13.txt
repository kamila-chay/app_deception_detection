The individual’s raised eyebrows might be interpreted as a sign of surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating an attempt to convince or manipulate the listener. However, this same gesture could simply reflect genuine engagement or a natural response to the conversation’s content, lacking any deceptive intent. Their frequent blinking could suggest heightened nervousness or discomfort often associated with deception, yet it might equally be a normal physiological reaction to stress, fatigue, or even bright lighting conditions in the environment. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor can be read as a deliberate effort to establish trust and project honesty, or conversely, it could be a conscious strategy to overcompensate and create a facade of truthfulness. The palms-up gesture traditionally signals openness and sincerity, but depending on context, it might also serve as a calculated appeal for empathy or a way to deflect suspicion. Each of these behaviors, therefore, holds dual potential meanings; without considering the broader situational cues and baseline behaviors, any conclusion about truthfulness or deception remains tentative and requires cautious interpretation.

The subject maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest confidence and sincerity, as truthful individuals often engage directly to reinforce their honesty and openness. It could indicate that the person feels comfortable and has nothing to conceal, using eye contact to establish trust and credibility. On the other hand, prolonged gaze might also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, as some individuals employ intense eye contact to overcompensate for their dishonesty, attempting to appear more convincing or to distract from inconsistencies in their narrative. Additionally, cultural factors and personal communication styles heavily influence gaze behavior, meaning that what appears as direct eye contact could be a learned social norm rather than an indicator of truthfulness. Thus, while the subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor provides some cues, these behaviors alone do not definitively reveal their honesty or deception without considering the broader context and other behavioral signals.

The subject exhibits a range of facial and head movements that can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. Their frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which could be a sign of someone wrestling with fabricated information. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect genuine confusion or deep thought as they process the conversation. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows may indicate surprise or feigned innocence, potentially a tactic to appear more credible. On the other hand, raised eyebrows might also naturally accompany moments of genuine engagement or questioning.

The movement of the chin upwards could be interpreted as a subtle display of defiance or attempts to assert control over the narrative, perhaps to maintain a deceptive stance. Yet, it may also be a spontaneous gesture reflecting confidence or an effort to emphasize a point sincerely. Conversely, the chin moving downwards might connote hesitation or submissiveness, possibly hinting at discomfort associated with dishonesty. Alternatively, it may simply be a moment of reflection or a natural part of the speaker's expressive repertoire.

Their gaze patterns add another layer of complexity. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor might be a deliberate strategy to convince or mask deceit, but it could equally be a sign of honest engagement and openness. Sideways glances, often cited as avoidance behaviors, might suggest an attempt to evade scrutiny or suppress deceptive tendencies. Yet, such glances can also be indicative of cognitive processes like searching memory or managing anxiety unrelated to dishonesty. The turning of the head to the side can be read as a defensive maneuver, possibly revealing a subconscious desire to shield oneself when fabricating information. Alternatively, it might simply be a comfortable or habitual gesture without any deceptive connotation.

In sum, each of these behaviors carries dual interpretations that depend heavily on broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational variables. Without additional information, it remains equally plausible that these actions reflect either genuine communication or subtle signs of deception.

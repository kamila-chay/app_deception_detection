The person is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating a heightened emotional state that could align with fabricating or concealing information. Conversely, this same behavior might simply reflect genuine curiosity or engagement with the conversation, signaling openness rather than deception.

Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking down. Maintaining eye contact can be a sign of confidence and truthfulness, demonstrating a willingness to connect and share honestly. However, sustained or intense eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate and mask untruths. Meanwhile, the downward glance may suggest discomfort or hesitation, possibly hinting at evasiveness or guilt, but it could just as well reflect thoughtful reflection or modesty in communication.

The individual’s hands are observed scratching and making contact with their head or body. Such self-touching behaviors might be manifestations of nervousness or stress, potentially revealing internal conflict characteristic of deceptive behavior. Yet, these actions might also be habitual or serve as self-soothing gestures in a social situation that is simply stressful or unfamiliar, without any relation to dishonesty.

Given these mixed signals, interpreting their truthfulness or deception solely on these behaviors is challenging. Each action can hold dual meanings, and without additional context—such as the nature of the conversation, baseline behaviors, or verbal cues—any conclusions about their honesty remain tentative.

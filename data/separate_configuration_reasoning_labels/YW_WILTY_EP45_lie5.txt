The subject's frowning eyebrows might suggest concentration or discomfort, which in some cases could be interpreted as a sign of withholding information or anxiety related to deception. Conversely, such an expression may simply reflect genuine concern or confusion about the topic being discussed, indicating truthful engagement. Their raised eyebrows could be seen as an attempt to appear more sincere or to emphasize honesty, yet this gesture might also serve as a subtle display of surprise or disbelief, which could either support their truthfulness or signal inconsistency in their narrative.

Frequent blinking is often associated with nervousness, possibly hinting at the cognitive load involved in fabricating details or managing a deceptive account. However, increased blinking can also occur due to environmental factors such as lighting or dryness, or even as a natural response to emotional stress unrelated to dishonesty. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor might demonstrate openness and confidence, traits aligned with truthful behavior, although sustained eye contact can also be consciously employed to mask deceit and engender trust, thus complicating interpretation.

The subject’s head shaking may indicate disagreement or denial, which could be sincere or a defensive reaction aimed at rejecting uncomfortable questions. Alternatively, it might be a nonverbal cue meant to distract or distance themselves from admitting something, thereby hinting at deception. Palms held up generally signal openness and honesty, as if welcoming scrutiny; yet, this same gesture can be strategically used to convey innocence or to defuse suspicion regardless of underlying truthfulness.

Lastly, having arms open can be perceived as a gesture of receptiveness and vulnerability, reinforcing credibility. On the other hand, it could be a rehearsed posture designed to appear non-threatening and transparent, potentially deployed to conceal deceptive intentions. Ultimately, while these behaviors provide valuable signals, their interpretation heavily depends on the broader context, baseline behavior, and other corroborative cues to draw a more reliable conclusion about the subject’s truthfulness or deception.

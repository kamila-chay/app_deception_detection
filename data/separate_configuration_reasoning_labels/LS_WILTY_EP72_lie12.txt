The subject’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in two distinct ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which could indicate truthfulness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle signal of doubt or incredulity, potentially reflecting discomfort or an unconscious cue associated with deceit. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor similarly presents a dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact might demonstrate confidence and openness, supporting the notion that they are truthful. However, sustained eye contact can also be consciously employed to convince or manipulate, which might raise suspicion about their honesty.

The backward movement of the head introduces another layer of complexity. This gesture might be read as a natural physical response to processing information or maintaining personal space, consistent with truthful communication. On the other hand, it could be a defensive behavior, signaling discomfort or an attempt to create distance from distressing or fabricated content, thereby hinting at potential deception. Additionally, the head shaking carries ambiguous connotations. It might straightforwardly signify disagreement or negation, reinforcing the subject’s position as truthful in denying something. Yet, it could also be a rehearsed or automatic response intended to convey denial strongly, which may mask deeper uncertainty or dishonesty.

Ultimately, these behaviors must be assessed within the broader context of the conversation and the individual’s baseline tendencies to draw more definitive conclusions about their veracity.

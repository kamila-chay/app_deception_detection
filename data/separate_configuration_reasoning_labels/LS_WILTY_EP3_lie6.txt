The subject's smile and the upward pull of their lip corners may suggest a genuine attempt to convey friendliness and openness, which can be associated with truthfulness. However, such expressions could also be consciously employed to mask discomfort or fabricate sincerity, especially if the smile appears controlled or inconsistent with other emotional cues. Their raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or engagement, signaling attentiveness to the conversation, yet the same gesture can be a deliberate attempt to feign interest or innocence, potentially signaling deception.

With their mouth closed, the subject could be maintaining composure and carefully considering their responses, reflecting honesty and thoughtfulness. Conversely, a closed mouth might also serve as a barrier to prevent unintentional disclosures, hinting at a reluctance to reveal information. The gaze directed towards the interlocutor suggests directness and openness, often linked to truthful communication. On the other hand, the accompanying sideways glances could imply evasiveness or discomfort, possibly reflecting attempts to avoid eye contact when constructing a deceptive narrative, or alternatively, they may indicate the individual is simply processing information and recalling memories.

The subtle movements of head tilting and side-turning can be interpreted as signs of engagement and empathy, enhancing rapport in sincere interactions. Yet, in another light, these gestures might be strategic to deflect or soften the delivery of uncertain or misleading information. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues about the person's baseline behavior and the nature of the conversation, these behaviors provide ambiguous signals that could equally support interpretations of both honesty and deception.

The subject’s smile, combined with the lip corners turning upward, might initially suggest a display of genuine positive emotion or openness, which often accompanies truthful communication. However, smiles can also be deliberately employed to mask discomfort or to manipulate the impression one gives, especially if they are used strategically to deflect suspicion. Frequent blinking could be interpreted as a sign of nervousness or cognitive overload, possibly indicating the mental effort involved in fabricating information. Conversely, blinking rates naturally fluctuate in response to environmental factors or emotional states unrelated to deception, such as fatigue or stress from an unrelated source.

Their mouth remains closed throughout, which might reflect control over their verbal expressions, potentially signaling caution in what they reveal—sometimes a marker of withholding information or deceit. On the other hand, a closed mouth may simply be due to the conversational context or personal communication style, not necessarily linked to dishonesty. The subject’s lips show complex movements, including protrusion and retraction, which can hint at underlying emotional ambivalence or attempts to regulate facial expressions deliberately. Yet, these subtle lip movements could also be idiosyncratic behaviors or reactions to speaking conditions like dryness or nervous tension that have no bearing on truthfulness.

Their gaze dynamics reveal a mixture of direct eye contact, gazes upward, and sideways glances. Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor is frequently associated with confidence and honesty, but some individuals may do so to overcompensate and appear truthful. Gaze shifting upward or sideways can be perceived as cognitive processing or searching for fabricated details; still, it might equally reflect genuine attempts to recall memories or manage conversational flow. Nodding and varied head movements, such as tilting, side-turning, and lifting of the head, can be signs of engagement, agreement, or an effort to convey openness. Alternatively, these gestures may serve as unconscious attempts to soothe oneself or create a sense of rapport that masks internal discomfort, possibly linked to deception.

Ultimately, each of these behaviors could be indicative of either truthfulness or deception depending on the broader context, including baseline behavior, cultural norms, and situational stressors. Without additional information, it remains difficult to draw definitive conclusions solely based on these observed cues.

The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor may suggest openness and engagement, which are often associated with truthfulness. However, such steady eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere and mask deception. Their head tilting could be interpreted as a sign of interest or empathy, indicating they are genuinely processing the conversation. Conversely, head tilting might serve as a subtle attempt to appear non-threatening and disarm suspicion, potentially signaling calculated behavior rather than genuine emotion. The folded arms may reflect a defensive posture, hinting at discomfort or a subconscious barrier when facing perceived scrutiny, which could align with deceptive intent. Alternatively, folded arms can simply be a comfortable or habitual position, unrelated to the honesty of their statements. These behaviors, viewed individually and without broader contextual cues, can support opposing interpretations, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive assessment before drawing conclusions about truthfulness.

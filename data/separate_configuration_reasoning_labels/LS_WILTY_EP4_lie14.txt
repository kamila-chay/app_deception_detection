The individual’s frequent blinking could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might suggest increased cognitive load or stress, which can be associated with attempting to fabricate or withhold information. However, frequent blinking can also be a natural response to environmental factors, such as lighting or dryness, or simply a habitual behavior unrelated to deception. Their lip corners turning downward may indicate discomfort or displeasure, which some might link to feelings of guilt or unease when being deceptive. Conversely, this expression could reflect concentration, sadness, or dissatisfaction with the topic, rather than dishonesty.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often signals honesty and engagement, yet in some cases, it might be a deliberate effort to appear truthful or to mask deceit. Nodding typically conveys agreement or attentiveness, which might mean the person is sincerely involved in the conversation. On the flip side, it could be a strategic behavior intended to reinforce their credibility or to encourage agreement from the other party. The forward movement of the head can indicate interest and active participation, potentially reflecting genuine involvement. Still, it might equally be interpreted as an attempt to assert dominance or control the interaction, behaviors sometimes employed in deceptive contexts.

Finally, the subject’s open arms posture generally conveys openness and a willingness to communicate, often associated with truthfulness. Yet open arms can also be a conscious display designed to feign transparency and mitigate suspicion. Ultimately, each of these behaviors offers cues that can be read in either direction depending on the broader context, and careful consideration of additional verbal and nonverbal signals is essential before drawing firm conclusions about truthfulness or deception.

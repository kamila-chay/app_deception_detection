The person’s frequent blinking might be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or anxiety, which some could associate with the stress of deception or the mental effort involved in fabricating information. However, frequent blinking can also be a natural physiological response to lighting conditions, eye irritation, or simply a habitual mannerism unrelated to dishonesty. Their steady gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest confidence and openness, qualities typically linked to truthfulness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, maintaining eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy employed to appear sincere and avoid suspicion, masking any underlying deceit. Because these behaviors can be contextualized in multiple ways, it is essential to consider additional information and the broader interaction dynamics before drawing any firm conclusions about their veracity.

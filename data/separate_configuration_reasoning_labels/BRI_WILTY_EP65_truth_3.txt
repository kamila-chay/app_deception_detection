The subject’s gaze directed sideways can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, looking away from the interlocutor may suggest an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which is often associated with discomfort or evasion—potentially indicative of deceit. This sideways glance might serve as a subconscious effort to suppress or manage feelings of guilt or anxiety triggered by fabricating information. Conversely, this behavior could equally reflect cognitive processing or recollection, as individuals sometimes look away to concentrate better or retrieve memories, which aligns with truthful behavior and sincere reflection.

Similarly, the posture of the head held up presents a dual interpretation. Holding the head high can be a sign of confidence and openness, conveying honesty and credibility. It might indicate that the person feels in control and is comfortable with the narrative they are presenting. However, this same behavior can be a deliberate strategy to project confidence and mask underlying uncertainty or deception. By maintaining an elevated head position, the individual may be attempting to appear more authoritative or unshakable, thereby deflecting suspicion.

Given these nuances, each behavior—gaze sideways and head up—holds potential significance that could lean either toward deceit or honesty depending on the broader context. Without additional information such as verbal cues, emotional expressions, or situational factors, these behaviors alone do not conclusively point to one interpretation over the other. A more comprehensive evaluation incorporating the overall interaction and other behavioral indicators would be crucial for a reliable assessment.

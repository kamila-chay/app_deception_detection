The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This might indicate surprise or skepticism, potentially suggesting they are reacting to an unexpected question or trying to feign innocence. Conversely, it could simply be a natural response to the conversation or a way to express attentiveness, rather than an attempt to deceive.

Their lip corners are turned down, which could be seen as a sign of discomfort or displeasure, possibly hinting at underlying stress associated with fabricating information. Alternatively, this expression may reflect genuine concern or disagreement with the topic at hand, not necessarily connected to dishonesty.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor might imply confidence and openness, possibly indicating truthfulness. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate effort to appear credible or to manipulate the perception of honesty, making this behavior ambiguous on its own.

The subject’s palms are facing upwards, often a gesture interpreted as openness or appeal, suggesting transparency and honesty. Yet, it can also be a strategic display aimed at appearing non-threatening and cooperative, potentially masking deceptive intentions.

With arms open, the individual might be signaling receptiveness and honesty, reinforcing an impression of sincerity. On the other hand, this openness could be part of a calculated posture to build trust and deflect suspicion, rather than stemming from genuine candor.

Lastly, the subject shrugs, a movement that might convey uncertainty or lack of knowledge, supporting the notion that they are being truthful about their limitations. Conversely, this gesture could be a subtle admission of evasion or an attempt to avoid committing to an answer, which might hint at deception.

Overall, these behaviors can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context, making it essential to consider additional cues and situational factors before drawing firm conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

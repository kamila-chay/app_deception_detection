The person is raising their eyebrows, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, eyebrow raises might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness in their communication. On the other hand, it could also be a subtle cue of skepticism or disbelief, possibly indicating discomfort with the truth they are presenting. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor suggests engagement and confidence, which might support the idea they are being truthful. However, such sustained eye contact could also be a deliberate strategy to convince the listener, masking underlying deceit.

The forward movement of the head can convey eagerness to connect and sincerity, implying the person is earnest in their message. Conversely, this gesture might be a rehearsed way to appear more believable or to dominate the conversational space, potentially signaling manipulation. The side-turning of the head introduces further ambiguity; it might be a natural, thoughtful response or an indication of evasiveness, as if diverting full attention away from a difficult admission.

Head shaking typically conveys disagreement or denial, which could mean the person is refuting false accusations truthfully. Alternatively, it might reflect a defensive mechanism intended to reject uncomfortable truths, hinting at potential dishonesty. Lastly, the open position of the arms generally signals openness and receptivity, fostering a sense of transparency. However, this same posture can be a controlled, rehearsed display designed to project trustworthiness, while inner tension or deceit remains concealed.

Considering these behaviors in isolation provides no definitive conclusion. The true meaning behind each gesture depends heavily on the broader context, including verbal content, baseline behavior, and environmental factors. A holistic approach is therefore essential to accurately interpret whether the person is being truthful or deceptive.

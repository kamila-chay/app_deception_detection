The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners may initially suggest a positive or sincere demeanor, often associated with truthfulness and genuine engagement. However, smiles can also be strategically employed as a social mask or to deflect suspicion, potentially indicating an attempt to appear more trustworthy than they truly are. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor reinforces this duality; steady eye contact is commonly interpreted as a sign of confidence and honesty, yet it can also be deliberately maintained to conceal deception or to exert control over the interaction. The backward movement of the head introduces another layer of complexity, as it might signal a moment of distancing or discomfort, possibly revealing hesitation or an attempt to create psychological space during a deceptive moment. Conversely, such a head movement could simply reflect a natural reaction to processing information or a social cue, with no deceptive intent. Ultimately, without additional context, these behaviors must be viewed with caution, acknowledging that each could reflect either a truthful or deceptive state depending on the broader interaction and underlying motivations.

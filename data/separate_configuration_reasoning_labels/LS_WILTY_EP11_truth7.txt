The subject’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context of the interaction. Raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or uncertainty, possibly reflecting discomfort that could accompany deceptive behavior. Conversely, this same expression could simply indicate genuine surprise or engagement with the topic being discussed, pointing toward truthfulness rather than deceit. The corners of their lips turning downward may be seen as a subtle sign of displeasure or stress, emotions that are often associated with the cognitive load involved in fabricating information. However, this expression could also be a natural resting face or a reaction to external circumstances unrelated to deception.

Their lips being protruded might suggest hesitation or an unconscious attempt to withhold information, which some interpret as a hallmark of deceitful communication. Yet, lip protrusion can just as well be a neutral or habitual gesture, possibly signaling concentration or thoughtfulness rather than any intent to deceive. The sideways gaze is often highlighted in behavioral analyses as a potential indicator of evasion or an effort to disengage from direct confrontation, hinting at possible deception. On the other hand, fleeting or repeated sideways glances might simply reflect an effort to recall memories or assess the environment, activities fully compatible with truthful communication.

Head tilting and turning to the side introduce further complexity. These gestures can be seen as avoidance behaviors or subtle signs of defensiveness, suggesting an unwillingness to fully confront the interlocutor or the subject matter at hand. Conversely, such head movements might express genuine curiosity, openness, or an empathetic stance, which are generally consistent with honesty. Ultimately, the interpretation of these behaviors hinges on the broader situational context, including the baseline behavior of the individual and the specific dynamics of the interaction. Without additional information, it is prudent to maintain a balanced perspective and recognize that these nonverbal cues could just as easily support a truthful narrative as point to deception.

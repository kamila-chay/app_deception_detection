The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen from two perspectives. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest openness and confidence, indicative of someone being truthful and engaged in the conversation. On the other hand, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere while concealing information, as some individuals use steady eye contact to mask deception and manipulate perceptions. The moments when the subject’s eyes shift downward may similarly have dual interpretations. This behavior could represent a thoughtful pause or reflection, as people often look down when trying to access memories or carefully consider their response. Conversely, it might indicate discomfort or avoidance, potentially signaling an effort to hide emotions or evade direct communication associated with deceit. The subject’s head tilting also opens multiple avenues for understanding. It might demonstrate curiosity or empathy, suggesting a genuine interest and an open stance in the interaction. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as a subtle sign of uncertainty or insecurity, possibly revealing internal conflict or hesitation related to untruthfulness. Ultimately, each of these behaviors—gaze direction and head movement—can carry contrasting meanings depending on the broader conversational context, emotional state, and individual baseline mannerisms, highlighting the importance of integrating these observations with additional cues before drawing any conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

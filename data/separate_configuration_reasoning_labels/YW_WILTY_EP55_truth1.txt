The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, it might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, as people often raise their eyebrows to reinforce their statements or express openness. Conversely, raised eyebrows may also be a subtle sign of uncertainty or disbelief, potentially indicating an effort to mask discomfort or hesitation that could be associated with deception.

Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which can similarly be read from two perspectives. Maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and sincerity, as truth-tellers often look directly at the person they are communicating with. However, it can also be a deliberate strategy employed by someone fabricating information to simulate trustworthiness and avoid suspicion, especially if the gaze seems fixed or overly intense without natural breaks.

The subject’s palms are facing upwards, a gesture commonly seen as an open and honest signal, often interpreted as a nonverbal cue of transparency and willingness to communicate. On the other hand, this same behavior might be consciously or unconsciously used to appear more trustworthy, creating an impression of innocence or lack of threat while potentially hiding deceptive intentions.

Given these behaviors—raised eyebrows, directed gaze, and palms up—the interpretation hinges greatly on the broader context and additional cues. Each action could indicate genuine truthfulness or be part of a nuanced attempt to influence perception. Without further information or corroborating evidence, it is prudent to remain neutral and consider both possibilities before drawing definitive conclusions.

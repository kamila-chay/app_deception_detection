The person’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often signals confidence and honesty, suggesting that the individual is comfortable with the interaction and has no reason to conceal information. It may convey openness and a willingness to engage transparently. Conversely, this same direct gaze could also be a deliberate strategy to appear trustworthy and mask any deceptive intent. Some individuals maintain intense eye contact deliberately as a way to manipulate impressions and prevent suspicion from arising. 

Similarly, the open positioning of the arms presents a dual interpretation. This body language might indicate receptiveness and an absence of defensive barriers, which can be consistent with truthful and genuine communication. The openness can signal a readiness to share information and foster rapport. On the other hand, arm openness might also be employed consciously to create an illusion of honesty and vulnerability, thereby deflecting scrutiny. Without signs of tension or incongruence elsewhere in the person’s behavior, it is challenging to discern whether this posture reflects sincerity or a calculated attempt to disarm.

Ultimately, while the combination of direct gaze and open arm posture can be seen as indicators of truthful engagement, they are not definitive proofs on their own. These behaviors must be interpreted within the wider context of the interaction, considering additional verbal and nonverbal cues, the subject’s baseline demeanor, and situational factors to reliably assess their truthfulness or deceptive tendencies.

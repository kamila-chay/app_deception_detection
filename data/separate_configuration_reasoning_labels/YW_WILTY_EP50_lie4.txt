The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing their truthfulness. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and openness, which are often associated with honesty. It can indicate that the person is engaged and willing to communicate transparently. Conversely, such attentive gaze might also be a conscious effort to appear credible and convincing, potentially masking deceptive intent. The person may be deliberately sustaining eye contact to avoid suspicion or to manipulate the perception of sincerity.

On the other hand, gaze alone does not provide conclusive evidence. Cultural and individual differences greatly influence eye contact patterns; some individuals naturally maintain strong eye contact regardless of their veracity, while others may find prolonged eye contact uncomfortable regardless of their truthfulness. Furthermore, the context of the interaction is critical—if the person is under pressure or feels scrutinized, their gaze behavior might shift for reasons unrelated to deception, such as anxiety or a desire to comply with social expectations.

Thus, while the direction and quality of the subject’s gaze can offer cues, interpreting it in isolation could lead to erroneous conclusions. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating contextual factors and additional behaviors is essential to make a more balanced and accurate judgment regarding their truthfulness.

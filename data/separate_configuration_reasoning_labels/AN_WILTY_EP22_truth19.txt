The individual’s steady gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest openness and confidence, which are often associated with truthfulness, as the person seems willing to engage directly and transparently. Conversely, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to convince or dominate the conversation, potentially masking deception by creating an illusion of honesty. Similarly, the gesture of showing palms upwards carries a dual significance. This open-handed posture is frequently seen as a sign of sincerity and a non-threatening attitude, reinforcing the perception that the person has nothing to hide. Yet, this same gesture may be consciously employed to appear more credible, especially if the context indicates that the individual is attempting to persuade or deflect suspicion. Both behaviors, therefore, require a nuanced consideration of the broader situational context and accompanying verbal and nonverbal cues to discern whether they genuinely signify truthfulness or are part of a crafted display intended to obscure the truth.

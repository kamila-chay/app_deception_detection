The subject’s gaze directed toward the interlocutor can be interpreted in two contrasting ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often signifies confidence and honesty, suggesting that the person is engaged and open in the conversation. On the other hand, prolonged or intensified gaze could be a conscious effort to mask deceit or to feign sincerity, as some individuals overcompensate when fabricating information. Similarly, their downward gaze might indicate discomfort or cognitive strain, which could be linked to the mental effort involved in constructing a deceptive narrative. Conversely, looking down may also simply reflect contemplation or moments of genuine reflection, without any deceptive intent. The forward movement of the head adds another layer of nuance; it could be seen as a gesture of eagerness to communicate or assertiveness, underscoring a truthful engagement. Alternatively, this action might be interpreted as an attempt to dominate or redirect the interaction when feeling cornered, which some might associate with deceptive behavior. Ultimately, understanding the implications of these behaviors necessitates integrating this information with broader contextual cues and baseline behaviors to draw a more accurate conclusion.

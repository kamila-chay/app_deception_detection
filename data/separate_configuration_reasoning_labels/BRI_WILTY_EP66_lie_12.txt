The subject’s gaze shifting upward may be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, looking up is sometimes associated with accessing visual memories or constructing images, which could suggest that the person is fabricating a story rather than recalling an actual event. This behavior might indicate a cognitive effort to create plausible details or manipulate information. Conversely, the upward gaze could simply reflect the natural process of trying to remember or visualize past experiences, suggesting a genuine attempt at truthfulness. People often look upward when searching their mental archives, which is not inherently deceptive.

Similarly, the sideways gaze can be viewed through dual lenses. It may signal evasiveness or discomfort, potentially reflecting an attempt to avoid direct eye contact that is often thought to be an indicator of deceit. Avoiding straight eye contact might be an unconscious attempt to hide something or reduce the pressure associated with lying. On the other hand, looking sideways can also be a natural response to processing information, reflecting contemplation or distraction rather than intentional deceit. In some cases, it could be a habitual mannerism or a reaction to the social dynamics of the interaction, unrelated to truthfulness.

Taken together, these behaviors—gaze up and gaze sideways—do not provide definitive evidence by themselves. They could equally be signs of cognitive processing during honest recall or subtle indicators of deceit. Without additional contextual information such as baseline behavior, verbal cues, or the situational background, it is difficult to make a conclusive determination. Both possibilities warrant consideration in a balanced and nuanced assessment.

The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might signal surprise or a genuine reaction to the topic at hand, suggesting honesty and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also function as a deliberate attempt to appear more open or convincing, possibly masking an underlying falsehood. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor similarly presents a dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact often reflects confidence and truthfulness, indicating they have nothing to hide. Yet, in some cases, sustained eye contact may be consciously employed to manipulate the listener’s perception, serving as a strategy to project sincerity despite potential deception.

The intermittent sideways glances further complicate the analysis. Such glances might indicate cognitive effort or attempts at recollection, supporting the notion that the individual is retrieving truthful memories. However, these shifts in gaze could also point toward evasiveness or discomfort, commonly associated with fabricating information or concealing details. Additionally, the subject’s hands covering parts of the face or mouth are behaviors frequently linked to nervousness or self-soothing, which could be symptomatic of deceit or anxiety about being caught. On the other hand, these gestures might simply reflect an unconscious habit or a natural reaction to feeling self-conscious during the interaction.

Ultimately, these behaviors—raising eyebrows, varied gaze patterns, and self-contact—offer ambiguous signals that can be consistent with both honesty and deception. A comprehensive understanding of the broader context, including verbal cues and baseline behavior, is essential to accurately interpret their significance and arrive at a more confident assessment.

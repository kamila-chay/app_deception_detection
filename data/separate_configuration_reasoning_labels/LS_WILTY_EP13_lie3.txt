The subject’s exaggerated mouth opening could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might suggest an attempt to emphasize sincerity or astonishment, potentially masking discomfort associated with deception. Conversely, this behavior might simply reflect natural expressiveness or an effort to communicate clearly, without any deceptive intent. The downward pull of the lip corners and the chin moving downward could be indicative of sadness or reluctance, possibly hinting at internal conflict consistent with deceit. However, these same gestures might just as well represent genuine emotions related to the topic discussed, such as frustration or disappointment, rather than dishonesty. Their gaze behavior—alternating between direct eye contact with the interlocutor and looking downward—also presents a dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact can be a sign of confidence and truthfulness, while at the same time, it might be a conscious effort to appear credible despite fabrications. Looking downward could signal discomfort or avoidance typical of someone concealing information, yet it can also be a natural reflective pause used when recalling memories. The head movements add further complexity; moving the head backward might suggest a defensive or distancing posture often associated with deception, or it could indicate surprise or a momentary reaction unrelated to deceit. Similarly, turning the head sideways and lifting it upwards might be attempts to evaluate the situation or search for answers, pointing toward thoughtful honesty, or alternatively, maneuvers to evade direct confrontation or scrutiny. Given these contrasting interpretations, it is clear that the subject’s behaviors alone cannot definitively attest to truthfulness or deception without considering the broader context, verbal cues, and baseline behavior for a more informed assessment.

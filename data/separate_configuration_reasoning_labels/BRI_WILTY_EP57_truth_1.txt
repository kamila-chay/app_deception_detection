The individual’s act of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it may signify surprise or uncertainty, potentially reflecting an attempt to react to unexpected questions or to fabricate information spontaneously. Conversely, raised eyebrows might simply reflect genuine curiosity or engagement in the conversation, signaling openness and attentive listening. Their steady gaze towards the interlocutor is also open to dual interpretation. Maintaining eye contact might be a conscious effort to appear honest and build trust, suggesting sincerity. Alternatively, it could be a deliberate strategy to overcompensate and convince the listener while masking deceit. Meanwhile, the subject’s nodding behavior can be seen as a sign of agreement or encouragement, reinforcing that they are aligned with the conversation and truthful in their responses. On the other hand, it could also serve as a tactic to placate the interlocutor, providing affirmative gestures to deflect suspicion or to maintain the flow of a fabricated narrative. Ultimately, these behaviors must be understood within the broader context of the interaction, as each could either support or undermine an inference of truthfulness depending on additional verbal and nonverbal cues.

The subject’s expression of frowning eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. It might suggest concentration or discomfort that could arise from the mental effort involved in constructing a deceptive narrative. Conversely, such a furrowed brow could simply reflect genuine confusion or concern about the topic being discussed, indicating sincerity rather than deceit. Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows could be read as a subtle cue of surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, potentially signaling openness and engagement in the conversation. On the other hand, raised eyebrows might also function as a tactical display to deflect suspicion or exaggerate emotions in an effort to appear convincing, which may be indicative of deception. Additionally, their consistent gaze directed towards the interlocutor might imply confidence and a willingness to maintain direct communication, traits often aligned with truthfulness. Yet, steady eye contact can also be deliberately maintained by someone fabricating information, as a conscious strategy to manage impressions and project credibility. Ultimately, these behaviors must be weighed carefully within the broader context of the interaction, as each can have plausible interpretations supporting either truthfulness or deception.

The subject’s gaze behavior presents an intriguing duality when evaluating the potential for deception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor could suggest confidence and openness, which often aligns with truthfulness, as maintaining eye contact is generally associated with sincerity and engagement in the conversation. However, in certain contexts, sustained eye contact can be a deliberate strategy to assert credibility and manipulate the perception of honesty, potentially masking deceptive intent. Conversely, the instances when they look upward may similarly be interpreted from two perspectives. On one hand, looking up is sometimes linked to cognitive processes such as visualizing or recalling information, which can indicate that the person is thoughtfully retrieving truthful memories. On the other hand, upward gaze has also been noted in some theories as a possible cue to fabricating or constructing information, suggesting the person might be inventing details. The key lies in the broader context and consistency of these behaviors with other verbal and nonverbal cues, as either gaze pattern could support arguments for truthfulness or deception depending on the situation’s nuances.

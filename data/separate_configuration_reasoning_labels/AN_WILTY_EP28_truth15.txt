The subject maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted as a sign of engagement and honesty, reflecting openness and confidence in what they are communicating. Conversely, such direct eye contact might also be a deliberate effort to appear convincing and mask any underlying dishonesty, as some individuals overcompensate by staring intently to avoid suspicion. Their occasional gaze sideways may suggest moments of discomfort or evasion, potentially indicating an attempt to avoid full transparency or to search for fabricated details. However, these sideways glances could just as plausibly reflect normal cognitive processes, such as recalling information or momentarily diverting attention without any deceitful intent. Additionally, the subtle head side-turn could be read as a nonverbal cue signaling reluctance or defensiveness, often hypothesized as a sign of deception. On the other hand, this same movement might merely be a natural gesture, signaling thoughtfulness or a reaction to external stimuli in the environment. Without a broader understanding of the individual's baseline behavior and the context of the interaction, these nonverbal cues alone do not definitively indicate truthfulness or deception.

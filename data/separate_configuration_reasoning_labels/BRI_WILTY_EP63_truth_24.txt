The subject’s gaze directed sideways can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, looking sideways might suggest an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, which some believe indicates discomfort or evasiveness often associated with deceptive behavior. This sideways glance could be a subtle cue that the person is mentally distancing themselves or struggling to maintain the truth. On the other hand, such a gaze might simply reflect a natural moment of thoughtfulness or distraction, perhaps as the individual processes information or recalls details. Sideways glances can also be a habitual or cultural behavior that does not necessarily connote deception. Without additional contextual clues, it is difficult to definitively attribute the sideways gaze to dishonesty or truthfulness, as it could just as well be an innocuous expression of cognitive engagement or personal mannerism.

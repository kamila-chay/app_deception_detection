The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest openness and confidence, which could indicate truthfulness. Conversely, steady eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate effort to appear sincere and mask deception. Meanwhile, the moments when the subject’s gaze shifts downward might raise suspicion, as looking away can be perceived as avoiding direct engagement or attempting to conceal information. However, looking down could equally reflect genuine thoughtfulness or discomfort unrelated to dishonesty, such as shyness or processing complex information. The head tilting adds another layer of complexity; it might be seen as a sign of curiosity and engagement, suggesting the person is invested in the conversation and being honest. Alternatively, head tilting can also be a subtle cue of uncertainty or insecurity, which might emerge when someone is fabricating or unsure about their statements. Ultimately, these behaviors cannot conclusively point to truthfulness or deception on their own, and understanding the broader context and additional cues is essential for making a more informed assessment.

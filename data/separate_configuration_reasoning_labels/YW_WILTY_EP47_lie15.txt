The subject’s raised eyebrows may suggest surprise or heightened emotional engagement, which could be genuine reactions to the topic at hand. Conversely, this gesture might be deliberately exaggerated to convey innocence or emphasize sincerity, potentially masking underlying deceit. Their exaggerated mouth opening could similarly indicate authentic shock or disbelief, yet it might also serve as an overemphasized display intended to manipulate the interlocutor’s perception of truthfulness. The direct gaze towards the interlocutor is often interpreted as a sign of honesty and openness, but it can equally represent a conscious effort to maintain control over the interaction and persuade through sustained eye contact. Meanwhile, the head shaking might reflect genuine disagreement or rejection of an assertion, but when combined with other cues, it could be a nonverbal tactic used to feign denial or deflect scrutiny. Finally, the hands covering the face or mouth could be a spontaneous reaction to embarrassment or discomfort in revealing sensitive information, yet they might also function as a protective barrier, signaling an unconscious attempt to hide deceitful expressions or intentions. Each of these behaviors carries dual potential meanings, and without additional contextual information, it remains challenging to definitively interpret them as signs of truthfulness or deception.

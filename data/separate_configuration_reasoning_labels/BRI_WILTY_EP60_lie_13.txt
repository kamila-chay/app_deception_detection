The individual is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can carry multiple interpretations. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signify surprise or emphasis, indicating that the person is engaged and forthcoming in the conversation. Conversely, this gesture could also be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or deflect suspicion, which sometimes accompanies deceptive behavior. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor further complicates the picture. Maintaining eye contact often suggests openness and honesty, as it can reflect confidence and a willingness to connect. However, in some cases, sustained eye contact is consciously employed as a strategy to convince or manipulate, potentially masking dishonesty.

Additionally, the subject exhibits sideways glances, which can be telling in different ways. Such glances might indicate discomfort or evasiveness, possibly signaling an effort to avoid scrutiny or to fabricate a response. Alternatively, these sideways looks could simply be moments of reflection or an attempt to access memories, reflecting a genuine cognitive process rather than deceit. Considering these behaviors together, their significance largely depends on the broader conversational and contextual cues, making it essential to integrate additional information before drawing conclusions about the person's truthfulness or deception.

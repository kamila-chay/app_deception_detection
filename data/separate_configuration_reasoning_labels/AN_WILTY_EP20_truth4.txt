The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and a desire to be transparent, which aligns with truthful behavior. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere and mask any dishonesty, as some individuals overcompensate by holding steady eye contact when fabricating information. The moments when the subject’s gaze shifts upward add another layer of complexity; this could indicate that they are thoughtfully recalling information or mentally constructing their narrative, which supports the idea of truthfulness. However, such upward glances are also often linked to cognitive effort involved in creating a false story, which might point toward deception. The subject’s head shaking is similarly ambiguous. It may reflect genuine disagreement or a firm denial of accusations, reinforcing their honesty. Alternatively, it could be a nonverbal cue meant to emphasize denial and dissuade suspicion, potentially signaling deception. Ultimately, without additional contextual cues and a broader understanding of the situation, these behaviors could be reasonably interpreted as signs of either truthfulness or deception.

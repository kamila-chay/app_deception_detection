The individual’s steady gaze towards the interlocutor may be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing deception. On one hand, sustained eye contact could suggest confidence and honesty, as truthful individuals often maintain eye contact to convey sincerity and engagement. Alternatively, it might indicate a conscious effort to appear convincing or to mask deceit, as those who are fabricating information sometimes overcompensate by locking eyes to avoid suspicion. Similarly, the observed head shaking presents an ambivalent signal. This gesture could reflect genuine disagreement or denial, reinforcing their stated position and thus supporting the possibility of truthfulness. Conversely, it could serve as a subtle nonverbal cue of internal conflict or discomfort, potentially signaling an attempt to resist acknowledging the falsehood or to persuade the listener against doubting them. Ultimately, both the gaze and the head movements carry nuanced meanings that depend heavily on the broader context, verbal content, and baseline behavior of the subject, making it essential to consider additional information before drawing firm conclusions about their veracity.

The subject’s raising of their eyebrows can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which could support the idea that they are being truthful. Conversely, this same gesture could be a subtle sign of discomfort or an involuntary reaction triggered by deceit, reflecting an internal conflict as they attempt to fabricate or conceal information. Their direct gaze toward the interlocutor similarly invites multiple interpretations. Maintaining eye contact often signifies confidence and openness, characteristics typically associated with honesty. However, sustained or intense eye contact can also be a deliberate tactic used to persuade or manipulate, potentially indicating a conscious effort to convince despite underlying falsehoods.

The presentation of palms facing upward along with open arms is frequently seen as an expression of openness and transparency, gestures that can reinforce the perception of truthfulness and good faith. Yet, these welcoming gestures may also be strategically employed to allay suspicion and project innocence, which might mask deceptive intentions when considered in a broader behavioral pattern or situational backdrop. Importantly, these behaviors alone cannot definitively determine credibility; they must be assessed in conjunction with verbal content, baseline behavior, and situational factors. The nuances of human communication demand a careful, holistic analysis before concluding whether these cues indicate genuine honesty or sophisticated concealment.

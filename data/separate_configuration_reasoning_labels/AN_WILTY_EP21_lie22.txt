The subject’s lips are retracted, which can sometimes suggest tension or discomfort, potentially signaling an underlying attempt to suppress or manipulate information. However, this expression might also simply reflect concentration or a natural facial posture unrelated to deception. Their chin moves downward, a gesture that could indicate submission or uncertainty, possibly revealing a subconscious hesitation characteristic of someone being untruthful. Conversely, this motion may be a sign of introspection or a moment of thoughtful reflection, thereby not necessarily indicative of deceit. The individual’s gaze shifts downwards, which is often interpreted as avoidance or guilt in deceptive contexts, yet it can equally suggest that they are carefully processing information or recalling a memory. At times, the gaze moves sideways, a behavior some associate with fabricating stories or attempting to access different parts of memory; however, it might simply be a way to momentarily disengage or find comfort in a stressful situation. Notably, the subject also nods intermittently, which could be perceived as a strategic attempt to appear agreeable and gain trust, but it might just as well be a genuine sign of engagement and affirmation. Similarly, head shaking is observed, which might mean disagreement or defensiveness typical in deceptive exchanges, or alternatively, it could be an honest response signaling negation or clarification. Given the ambiguity inherent in these behaviors, interpreting them far beyond their isolated occurrence demands consideration of the broader context, the individual’s baseline demeanor, and the surrounding conversational dynamics to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of possible deception.

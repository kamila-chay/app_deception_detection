The subject’s behavior of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might suggest surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating a genuine reaction to the topic being discussed, which supports the notion of truthfulness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a deliberate attempt to feign innocence or to distract, which could be a subtle cue of deception. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor further adds complexity to the interpretation. Maintaining eye contact might signal confidence and sincerity, implying that the person is being truthful and open. Alternatively, sustained gaze can sometimes be a conscious effort to appear honest when fabricating a story, as a deceptive individual may overcompensate to avoid suspicion. The occasional gaze sideways introduces additional ambiguity. This could reflect cognitive processing, such as trying to recall accurate details, which aligns with truthful behavior. However, it could equally suggest avoidance or discomfort, potentially indicating an attempt to conceal information or fabricate responses. Ultimately, without further contextual information or a broader behavioral baseline, each of these cues—raising eyebrows, gaze direction towards the interlocutor, and sideways glances—can plausibly support interpretations of both truthfulness and deception.

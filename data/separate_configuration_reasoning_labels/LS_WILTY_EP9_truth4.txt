The subject’s smile and raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. A genuine smile, accompanied by raised eyebrows, might indicate openness and sincerity, suggesting that the person is comfortable and honest in the interaction. Conversely, such expressions can also be consciously employed to mask deceit, projecting friendliness and trustworthiness to deflect suspicion. The lip corners turning upward reinforce this dual interpretation, as they may reflect genuine positive emotion or serve as a practiced social cue designed to create a favorable impression.

Similarly, the protrusion of the lips adds complexity to the analysis. This subtle gesture could indicate uncertainty or hesitation, possibly signaling internal conflict related to dishonesty. On the other hand, it might simply be a natural facial expression or a momentary reaction unrelated to deception, such as concentration or emphasis. The subject’s gaze behavior further complicates the picture. A direct gaze towards the interlocutor often conveys engagement and honesty, but when combined with sideways glances, it can either reflect normal cognitive processing—such as trying to recall information—or suggest evasiveness and discomfort associated with fabricating details.

The subject’s head movements—tilting and turning to the side—also possess ambiguous interpretations. Head tilting can be a sign of curiosity and genuine interest, thereby supporting the notion of truthful communication. Alternatively, it might indicate insecurity or an attempt to physically distance oneself from the conversation topic, potentially hinting at deception. Likewise, turning the head sideward could signify attentiveness or a relaxed demeanor, yet it may also be employed as a subtle nonverbal cue to disengage or avoid direct confrontation, which some individuals exhibit when being deceptive.

Finally, the open-arm posture typically suggests openness and receptiveness, characteristics often associated with honesty and transparency. However, such a posture can be consciously adopted to appear more approachable and trustworthy, possibly functioning as a strategic behavior to mask deceit. Without considering the broader context, such as the subject’s baseline behaviors and the content of their speech, each of these nonverbal cues remains open to interpretation, emphasizing the importance of integrating multiple sources of information before drawing conclusions about their truthfulness.

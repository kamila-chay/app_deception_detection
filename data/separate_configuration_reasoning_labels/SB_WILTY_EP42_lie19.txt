The subject’s raised eyebrows and exaggerated mouth opening may suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, potentially signaling a truthful emotional response. Conversely, these same behaviors could be interpreted as deliberate exaggerations intended to convince or mislead the viewer, reflecting possible deception. The movements of the chin—first upwards and then downwards—might indicate natural shifts in thought or expression that align with honest reflection. Alternatively, these subtle gestures could be strategic attempts to control their appearance or mask discomfort, which are sometimes associated with deceptive communication.

Their gaze patterns also present dual possibilities. Maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor can be seen as a sign of confidence and engagement, supporting the notion of truthfulness. However, in some cases, steady gaze may be consciously sustained to avoid the stereotype of a liar’s gaze aversion. When looking downward, the subject may be thoughtfully recalling information, demonstrating sincerity. On the other hand, downward gaze might also reflect evasiveness or attempts to hide deceptive cues, depending on the broader conversational context.

Furthermore, their nodding and head movements—leaning forward and turning sideways—could illustrate active listening and openness, reinforcing a truthful interaction. Conversely, these actions might be employed to feign attentiveness or to distract, potentially serving as mechanisms to mask fabrication or discomfort. Ultimately, these behaviors should be interpreted within the full scope of the interaction, considering baseline patterns and contextual factors, to draw any substantive conclusions about truthfulness or deception.

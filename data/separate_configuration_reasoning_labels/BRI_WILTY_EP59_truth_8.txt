The individual’s act of raising their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it may signify surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which could support the idea that they are being truthful. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also be a deliberate effort to feign innocence or to distract from deceptive intent, especially if it appears exaggerated or untimely within the conversation.

Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor presents another layer of complexity. Maintaining eye contact is often associated with honesty and engagement, suggesting openness and truthfulness. Yet, deliberate or intense eye contact can also be a conscious strategy to convince or manipulate, used by individuals who are fabricating information to appear credible.

When their gaze shifts downward, this behavior can be read in contrasting ways as well. Looking down might indicate discomfort or internal reflection that accompanies admitting truthful but difficult information. Alternatively, it could signal avoidance or concealment, commonly linked to deceptive behavior as a way to escape direct scrutiny.

Each of these visible behaviors—raising eyebrows, varying gaze direction—can thus be seen through different lenses depending on the broader context, their baseline behavior, and other cues present in the interaction. Without additional context, drawing a definitive conclusion about their truthfulness or deception remains challenging.

The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be indicative of concentration or concern, possibly reflecting the mental effort involved in constructing a deceptive narrative. Conversely, this expression might simply be a natural reaction to processing complex information or recalling difficult details, showing genuine engagement rather than deceit. Their gaze directed upward can similarly be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it is often linked to the act of accessing internal visual memories, which some theories suggest may signal fabrication or imaginative effort. On the other hand, such a gaze might represent genuine recollection or thoughtful reflection, underscoring their attempt to answer honestly. Additionally, the open position of their arms might convey openness and a willingness to communicate transparently, which would argue in favor of truthfulness. Yet, open arms can also be a strategic posture, consciously adopted to appear non-threatening and forthright, potentially masking underlying dishonesty. Without further contextual cues or corroborative information, these behaviors remain open to interpretation, and a balanced assessment must consider both the possibility of deception and the likelihood of sincere intent.

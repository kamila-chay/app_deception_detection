The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining direct eye contact may suggest honesty and engagement, as individuals who are truthful often seek to establish trust and connection through open visual communication. On the other hand, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere, with the subject consciously sustaining eye contact to mask any deceptive intentions. Similarly, the nodding observed might indicate agreement and active listening, reinforcing the impression of sincerity and cooperative behavior. Conversely, frequent nodding can sometimes be used to influence or manipulate the listener, creating an illusion of credibility or compliance even when the person may not be fully truthful. Ultimately, while these behaviors can offer clues to the subject’s mental state, interpreting them definitively as signs of truthfulness or deception requires considering the broader context, baseline behaviors, and additional verbal and non-verbal cues to make a more informed assessment.

The subject displays a smile with the corners of their lips turned upward, which might suggest genuine warmth and openness, indicative of truthfulness. However, such a smile can also be a controlled social expression, potentially masking discomfort or deceit. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor often signals engagement and confidence, reinforcing the notion of honesty; yet, maintaining eye contact can equally be a deliberate effort to appear believable and deflect suspicion. Conversely, moments when the gaze shifts upward could imply cognitive processing, as if they are thoughtfully recalling information, supporting the idea of sincerity. On the other hand, upward gaze might also be a subconscious attempt to access fabricated details or create a narrative. The head tilting observed can be interpreted as a sign of curiosity and active listening, fostering rapport and truthful interaction. Alternatively, it might reflect uncertainty or a subtle strategy to appear more sincere than they actually are. Ultimately, these behaviors, taken individually, offer ambiguous signals that require further contextual understanding to accurately discern the subject’s truthfulness or potential deception.

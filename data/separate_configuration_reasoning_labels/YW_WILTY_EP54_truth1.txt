The subject’s lip corners turning upward might be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this subtle smile could suggest genuine positive engagement and comfort in the conversation, reflecting a truthful and relaxed demeanor. On the other hand, it could be a deliberate attempt to mask true emotions or to create a façade of sincerity, which can sometimes accompany deceptive behavior. Their gaze towards the interlocutor is similarly ambiguous; sustained eye contact often indicates confidence and honesty, as one feels no need to avoid scrutiny. Conversely, maintaining eye contact might be a conscious strategy to persuade or manipulate, as some individuals use steady gaze to project trustworthiness. The gaze shifting upwards introduces an additional layer of complexity. Looking upwards is sometimes linked to cognitive processing or trying to access memories, which may reinforce the idea that the person is being truthful and thoughtfully recalling information. However, it could also be a sign of fabricating or constructing a narrative, as the upward gaze may reflect imaginative thought rather than authentic memory retrieval. Ultimately, these behaviors must be assessed within the broader context of the interaction, as each can signify either honesty or deceit depending on factors such as baseline behavior, situational stress, and the content of the dialogue.

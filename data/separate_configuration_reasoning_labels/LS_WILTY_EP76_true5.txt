The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact may suggest openness and honesty, reflecting a willingness to engage transparently in the conversation. It might indicate confidence and comfort with the information being shared, which aligns with truthful communication. Conversely, deliberate and intense eye contact can sometimes be a calculated effort to convince or manipulate, intended to mask deceit by appearing overly attentive or cooperative. Such behavior might be used to distract from inconsistencies or to assert dominance in the interaction.

Similarly, the moments when the subject’s gaze shifts upward also carry dual interpretations. Looking upward could signal that the person is recalling specific memories or searching for accurate information, which supports the notion that they are striving to be truthful. This upward gaze can be a natural cognitive cue indicating thoughtful reflection or mental retrieval of details. On the other hand, this same behavior might be associated with fabrication or evasion, as some theories suggest that looking away or upward may help individuals create false narratives or mentally distance themselves from the lie. It may serve as a subtle indicator that the subject is not fully forthcoming.

In essence, these gaze behaviors are complex and can be read in contrasting ways depending on the broader context of the interaction, the subject’s baseline behavior, and accompanying verbal and nonverbal cues. Without additional information, it is prudent to consider both interpretations equally before drawing firm conclusions about the subject’s truthfulness.

The subject’s raised eyebrows may suggest surprise or heightened attention, potentially signaling a reaction to fabricating information or experiencing stress related to deception. Conversely, raised eyebrows are also a common expression of genuine interest or curiosity, which could simply indicate engagement with the conversation. Their chin moving upwards and head held high might convey confidence and assertiveness, traits that can be associated with someone trying to convincingly present truthful information. Yet, such posture could also be a defensive mechanism, an attempt to assert dominance or mask insecurity when telling a falsehood. The direct gaze toward the interlocutor reflects openness and willingness to engage, which often supports credibility; however, the occasional sideways glances might hint at discomfort or evasion linked to deceit. Alternatively, these glances could represent moments of cognitive processing or searching for memories, illustrating thoughtful communication rather than deceit. The subject’s nodding can be interpreted as a sign of agreement or encouragement, fostering rapport and trust, but it might also be a deliberate strategy to appear cooperative and truthful despite underlying dishonesty. Their hands touching the head or body could indicate nervousness associated with deception, signaling internal conflict, yet this behavior might equally be a habitual or self-soothing gesture with no deceptive intent. Lastly, the openness of their arms might express receptivity and honesty, creating an impression of transparency. On the other hand, it can serve as a calculated display of openness designed to lower suspicion and manipulate the interlocutor’s perception. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors requires careful contextual analysis, as each could validly point toward either truthfulness or deception depending on situational nuances.

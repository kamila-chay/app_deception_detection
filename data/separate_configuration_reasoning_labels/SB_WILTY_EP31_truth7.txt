The person’s gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest engagement and sincerity, reflecting openness and a willingness to communicate honestly. However, this same direct eye contact could also be a practiced behavior intended to mask deceptive tendencies, as some individuals deliberately maintain steady gaze to appear truthful. Their gaze upward, meanwhile, could indicate that they are accessing memory or visualizing information, which aligns with recalling truthful details. Conversely, looking upward might also signify fabricated storytelling, as some theories propose that such eye movements relate to constructing rather than retrieving information. The head tilting could be interpreted as a sign of curiosity or attentiveness, contributing to the impression of genuine interest in the conversation. On the other hand, head tilting might serve as a subtle attempt to appear more relatable or disarming, potentially masking underlying discomfort or uncertainty. Similarly, the head shaking may denote a natural response to disagreement or emphasis, reinforcing the authenticity of their stance. Yet, it could also be a deliberate gesture used to negate or deflect, casting doubt on the veracity of their statements. Lastly, the arms open pose might signal openness and a non-defensive posture, implying transparency and honesty. Alternatively, open arms could be a strategic choice to convey confidence and credibility, even if the content shared is not entirely truthful. Without additional context, these behaviors remain ambiguous and should be evaluated carefully in conjunction with other verbal and nonverbal cues to form any definitive conclusions.

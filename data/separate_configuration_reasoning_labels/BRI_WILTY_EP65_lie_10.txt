The individual’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of assessing truthfulness. On one hand, a genuine smile might suggest openness and comfort, indicating that they are relaxed and sincere in their communication. A smile can also serve as a social cue to build rapport, which may reinforce perceptions of honesty. Conversely, smiling can sometimes be a deliberate attempt to mask discomfort or to deflect suspicion, potentially signaling an effort to appear more trustworthy than they actually are. In this sense, the smile could function as a façade, meant to obscure underlying deceit.

Similarly, the act of raising eyebrows can be ambiguous when trying to infer honesty. Raised eyebrows might denote surprise or emphasis, which could support the credibility of their statements by signaling genuine reactions and engagement with the topic at hand. It may also manifest as a natural, involuntary expression during truthful recounting of unexpected or noteworthy information. However, raised eyebrows can also be strategically used to manipulate or exaggerate emotions, potentially alerting the observer to an attempt to dramatize or fabricate elements of the story. Without additional context, such as the consistency of these expressions with verbal cues or baseline behavior, it remains difficult to definitively interpret the intent behind these signals.

Ultimately, while smiles and eyebrow raises are valuable behavioral indicators, they carry dual possibilities that necessitate careful consideration within the broader communicative context before drawing conclusions about veracity.

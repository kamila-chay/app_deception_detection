The person’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact might suggest sincerity, reflecting confidence and engagement in the conversation, which often accompanies truthful communication. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear honest and convincing, as someone who is deceptive might overcompensate by holding eye contact to avoid suspicion. Nodding during the interaction similarly carries dual interpretations. It might indicate active listening and agreement, signaling openness and alignment with the discussion, which supports the perception of truthfulness. Alternatively, the nods could be a rehearsed behavior intended to create rapport or mask discomfort, potentially serving as a tool to deflect scrutiny or encourage trust despite underlying deception. Without broader contextual information—including baseline behaviors, the nature of the conversation, and emotional cues—it remains challenging to definitively categorize these signals as truthful or deceptive, underscoring the importance of holistic analysis when assessing such nonverbal behaviors.

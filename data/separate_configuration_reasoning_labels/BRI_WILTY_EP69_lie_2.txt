The individual’s gaze behavior presents an interesting duality in interpreting potential deception. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor can be seen as a sign of honesty and engagement, as maintaining eye contact often suggests confidence and a willingness to connect truthfully. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere and mask any underlying deceit, as some people consciously use steady eye contact to avoid raising suspicion. On the other hand, the moments when their gaze shifts sideways might indicate discomfort or evasiveness, potentially signaling an attempt to avoid revealing details or fabricate information. Yet, these sideways glances could just as easily reflect the cognitive process of recalling memories or formulating responses, which naturally leads to brief distractions from direct eye contact without implying dishonesty. Ultimately, without a broader context, the gaze behaviors alone provide ambiguous clues—both consistent with truthful communication and with the subtle signs of deception.

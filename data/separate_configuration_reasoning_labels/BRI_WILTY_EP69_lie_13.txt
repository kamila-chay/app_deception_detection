The person’s gaze directed sideways can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, avoiding direct eye contact or looking sideways might suggest discomfort or an attempt to evade scrutiny, potentially indicating that they are being deceptive. It could be a subconscious effort to distance themselves from the truth or to mentally construct a fabricated narrative. On the other hand, looking sideways may simply reflect natural thinking patterns, as some individuals glance away when trying to recall information or formulate their thoughts. It may also be influenced by environmental factors or a desire to avoid direct confrontation without any deceptive intent.

Similarly, the display of palms-up gestures carries ambiguous meaning. Palms facing upwards are often considered a sign of openness and honesty, which could support the idea that the individual is being truthful and transparent in their communication. This gesture might be consciously or unconsciously employed to build trust and indicate sincerity. Conversely, such gestures can be deliberately used as a manipulation tactic, aiming to project innocence or vulnerability in order to deflect suspicion. The palms-up posture might also be a rehearsed behavior designed to mask deceit or to soften the perception of the message being conveyed.

Ultimately, these behaviors—gaze sideways and palms up—do not conclusively confirm truthfulness or deception on their own. Their interpretation hinges greatly on additional verbal and nonverbal cues, the nature of the interaction, and individual differences in communication style. Careful consideration of the overall context is essential before drawing any firm conclusions about the person’s honesty.

The subject’s raising of their eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context of the interaction. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or emphasis, potentially reflecting a sincere reaction to the topic at hand. Conversely, this same gesture could be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or elicit trust, which may be a strategic behavior used when fabricating information. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor is similarly ambiguous. Maintaining eye contact can be a sign of honesty and engagement, demonstrating openness and confidence. However, it can also indicate a calculated effort to appear credible and to monitor the listener’s reactions closely, which might be characteristic of deceptive behavior.

The gaze shifting upwards introduces another layer of complexity. Looking upward is sometimes associated with recalling memories or constructing stories, so this could either suggest genuine retrieval of information or a momentary search for fabricated details. The subject’s nodding can be perceived as an expression of agreement or reassurance, reinforcing the sincerity of their message, yet it might equally be used as a conscious tactic to persuade or placate the interlocutor during deception. The movements of the head—both forward and backward—offer conflicting cues as well; leaning forward can convey engagement and truthfulness, while leaning backward may indicate defensiveness or discomfort, though such movements might also be entirely incidental or related to physical comfort.

Finally, the palms-up gesture can convey openness and honesty, symbolizing a readiness to be transparent. Nevertheless, in the absence of other corroborating cues, it can also be a rehearsed display aimed at convincing the listener of the speaker’s credibility. Without additional context, these behaviors alone do not definitively prove whether the subject is being truthful or deceptive, as each gesture carries potential significance in both directions. A more accurate assessment would rely on an integrated understanding of these signals within the broader conversational and emotional framework.

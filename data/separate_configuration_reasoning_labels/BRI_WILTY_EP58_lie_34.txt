The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor might be interpreted as a sign of honesty and engagement, suggesting they are open and sincere in the conversation. However, this direct eye contact could also be a deliberate attempt to mask deceit, as some individuals maintain strong eye contact to appear credible and avoid suspicion. Their occasional gaze sideways can be seen as a natural moment of reflection or distraction, possibly indicating that they are thoughtfully considering the questions asked. Yet, in another light, these sideways glances might suggest discomfort or an effort to avoid revealing something by momentarily breaking the connection. The head side-turn might signify contemplation or processing information, aligning with a thoughtful and genuine response. Conversely, this shift could be an unconscious attempt to create distance or disengagement from the topic, potentially signaling an attempt to detach from an uncomfortable or dishonest narrative. Finally, the subject’s head shaking might be a straightforward expression of disagreement or doubt, representing a clear and honest reaction. On the other hand, such a gesture could be an exaggerated or rehearsed behavior meant to emphasize denial or reinforce a fabricated statement. Without additional context, it remains equally plausible that these behaviors reflect either genuine communication or subtle cues of deception.

The person is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways. In the context of possible deception, raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, as if they are trying to appear more credible or sincere. Conversely, this same action could simply reflect genuine emotional reactions such as interest or curiosity, with no deceptive intent involved. Similarly, their gaze directed towards the interlocutor can carry dual implications. Maintaining eye contact might indicate confidence and openness, reinforcing the perception of truthfulness. However, it could also be a deliberate strategy to manipulate or reassure the listener while concealing uncertainty or falsehood. Without considering the broader context, these behaviors alone do not conclusively reveal the person’s truthfulness or deceitfulness, and must be interpreted alongside other verbal and non-verbal cues to form a more accurate assessment.

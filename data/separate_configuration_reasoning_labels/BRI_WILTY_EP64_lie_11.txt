The subject’s smile could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, a genuine smile might suggest comfort and honesty, indicating they feel at ease during the interaction and are likely being truthful. Conversely, the smile could also be a social mask, a strategic attempt to disarm or distract the interlocutor, which might hint at underlying deception. Similarly, their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be read in contrasting manners. Maintaining eye contact might demonstrate confidence and openness, traits generally associated with sincerity. However, prolonged or intense gaze can also be a deliberate effort to appear credible and suppress any suspicion, potentially signaling that the person is consciously managing their nonverbal cues to conceal dishonesty. Ultimately, these behaviors alone are not definitive indicators; interpreting them demands careful consideration of the entire interaction and additional contextual information.

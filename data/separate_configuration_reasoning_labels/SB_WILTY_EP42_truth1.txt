The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this gesture might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness, as raised eyebrows can signal engagement and a genuine emotional response. Conversely, it might also indicate skepticism or an effort to mask discomfort, which could be consistent with deceptive behavior, particularly if the expression seems exaggerated or out of sync with the verbal content. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor further complicates the analysis. Maintaining eye contact is often associated with confidence and truthfulness, potentially signifying a sincere attempt to be transparent. However, sustained eye contact can also be a conscious strategy to convince or manipulate, especially if it feels intense or forced. The moments when their gaze shifts sideways introduce yet another layer of ambiguity. Looking away briefly might reveal an effort to search memory for truthful information or could be a subtle sign of evasiveness or cognitive load related to fabricating details. Similarly, the head turning to the side can be read in two ways: it might reflect natural conversational dynamics, such as listening carefully or responding thoughtfully, or it could suggest discomfort and an unconscious desire to create distance during a stressful or deceptive exchange. Without additional context, such as baseline behavior or the content of the conversation, it remains challenging to definitively interpret these cues as indicators of truthfulness or deception.

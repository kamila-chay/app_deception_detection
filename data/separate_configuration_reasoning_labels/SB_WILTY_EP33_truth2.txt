The individual’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways: it might suggest openness and engagement, indicating they are being truthful and attentive. Conversely, steady eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and mask deception. When their gaze shifts upward, this behavior could indicate cognitive processing or attempts to retrieve memories, consistent with honesty. However, such gaze aversions might also signify fabricated thinking or evasion, as the person constructs a story rather than recalling facts. The act of nodding typically communicates agreement and reinforces sincerity, but it might also be employed to appease the questioner or create a false sense of reliability. A movement of the head backward could reflect skepticism or discomfort, hinting at hesitation or possible dishonesty, yet it might also merely express surprise or a natural reaction to the conversation flow. Open arms often signal receptiveness and transparency, suggesting a willing and truthful communicator; on the other hand, this posture might be consciously adopted to appear more trustworthy or disarm suspicion. Conversely, folded arms might be seen as defensive or closed-off, potentially indicating concealment or emotional distance related to deception, whereas it could simply be a comfortable resting position or a habitual gesture without deeper psychological meaning. In sum, each observable behavior carries dual interpretations, underscoring the importance of integrating these cues within the broader conversational and contextual framework before drawing conclusions about veracity.

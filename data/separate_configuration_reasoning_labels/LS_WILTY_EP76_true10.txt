The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often suggests confidence and sincerity, potentially indicating that the person is being truthful and open in their communication. Conversely, prolonged eye contact can also be a conscious strategy employed by someone attempting to appear more credible or convince the listener, which might suggest an element of deception. Their occasional gaze sideways further complicates the interpretation. Sideways glances might reflect discomfort or evasiveness, hinting at an internal conflict or an attempt to avoid direct engagement, which could signal deceit. Alternatively, these glances could simply indicate cognitive processing, as people often look away momentarily when trying to retrieve memories or articulate thoughts clearly. Without additional contextual information, such as tone of voice or congruence between verbal and nonverbal cues, it remains difficult to definitively ascribe truthfulness or deception to their behavior, underscoring the importance of considering the broader situational context.

The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This action might signal surprise or disbelief, which could be consistent with genuine reactions during truthful communication. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also be a deliberate attempt to appear more open or engaged, possibly to mask uncertainty or fabricate information. Their lip corners are turned up, suggesting a smile that might convey friendliness and sincerity; however, smiles can also be strategically used to disarm suspicion or hide discomfort, making this behavior ambiguous without further clues.

The gaze towards the interlocutor is another nuanced indicator. Maintaining eye contact is often associated with honesty and confidence, reflecting a willingness to engage openly. On the other hand, sustained or intensified gaze can sometimes be a conscious effort to convince or manipulate, especially if paired with other incongruent cues. Additionally, the momentary downward gaze could hint at avoidance or hesitation, potentially signaling discomfort linked to deception. Yet, it could equally represent thoughtful reflection or recall of information, which are normal during sincere conversation.

Head tilting adds another layer to the behavioral interpretation. It can suggest openness, empathy, and attentiveness, traits commonly found in truthful interactions. Alternatively, it might be a self-soothing gesture or an attempt to appear non-threatening, which could be employed to mask underlying nervousness or deceit. Overall, these behaviors each carry possible meanings that oscillate between indicators of truthfulness and signs of deception. Without additional contextual information, such as verbal content or baseline behavior patterns, it remains challenging to definitively classify the subject’s actions as honest or deceptive.

The subject’s smile, combined with raised eyebrows, can be interpreted in multiple ways within the context of deception detection. On one hand, the smile and eyebrow raise might suggest an attempt to appear friendly and open, possibly as a strategy to mask deceit or to put the interlocutor at ease while fabricating details. Conversely, these facial expressions could genuinely reflect positive engagement or surprise, indicating sincerity and openness in the conversation. The closed mouth with lips’ corners turned up, alongside lips retracted, further complicates interpretation. Such subtle mouth movements may hint at controlled communication, as if the person is carefully monitoring what they say, possibly to avoid slipping into falsehoods. Alternatively, these behaviors might simply reflect natural expressions of politeness or contemplation, without any underlying intent to deceive.

The subject’s gaze behavior adds another layer of ambiguity. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor may be seen as a sign of confidence and truthfulness, as maintaining gaze often aligns with honesty in social communication. Yet, in some cases, intentional eye contact can be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate, suggesting potential deception. Moments of gazing downward could indicate discomfort, which might stem from the cognitive effort of fabricating a story, but this behavior is equally well-explained as a sign of reflection or modesty. Additionally, the slight side-turn of the head could be perceived as distancing behavior, possibly revealing unease or subtle avoidance consistent with deceptive intent. On the other hand, such a head movement may simply be a natural gesture in the flow of conversation or an unconscious expression of thoughtfulness.

Ultimately, these behaviors carry ambiguous meanings that can support opposing interpretations. Without the context of the overall interaction, emotional baseline, and specific situational factors, it remains difficult to conclusively determine whether the subject is being truthful or deceptive. Each cue should be weighed carefully within the broader conversational dynamics to form a more informed judgment.

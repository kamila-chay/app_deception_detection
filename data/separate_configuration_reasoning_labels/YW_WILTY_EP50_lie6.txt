The person’s gaze shifting sideways can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, a sideways glance might suggest evasiveness or discomfort, potentially signaling that the individual is attempting to avoid direct eye contact to conceal something or manage the stress associated with deception. Such a behavior can be a subconscious effort to disengage or mask their true feelings, which are often harder to control when fabricating information. Conversely, this same sideways gaze could simply reflect cognitive processing, as people often look away when trying to retrieve memories or concentrate on formulating their thoughts accurately. It can also indicate distraction or nervousness unrelated to dishonesty, such as feeling self-conscious or overwhelmed by the situation. Without additional behavioral or contextual cues, attributing deceptive intent purely based on the sideways gaze would be premature, so a closer examination of the wider interaction and other nonverbal signals would be essential to draw a more balanced conclusion.

The subject’s lip corners are turned upward, which could suggest genuine positive emotions such as confidence or comfort in the interaction, potentially lending credibility to their statements. However, this behavior might also be a controlled attempt to appear friendly and sincere, masking underlying deceit. The movements of their chin, alternating between upward and downward motions, add complexity to the interpretation. Chin raises might convey assertiveness or confidence, often associated with honesty, but they can also signal defensiveness or an attempt to assert dominance, possibly covering discomfort with the truth. Conversely, a downward chin movement may indicate submission or contemplation, which could reflect genuine reflection, yet it might also be a subtle cue of insecurity or uncertainty when fabricating information. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor is another ambiguous cue; maintaining eye contact often signifies engagement and truthfulness, yet some deceptive individuals consciously maintain steady eye contact to avoid suspicion. Meanwhile, nodding can be interpreted as active listening and agreement, reinforcing trustworthiness, but it may also be employed strategically to give the appearance of cooperation or to encourage acceptance of falsehoods. Ultimately, these behaviors, while suggestive, cannot conclusively determine truthfulness or deception without considering the broader context and additional information.

The person’s gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in different ways when considering truthfulness or deception. On one hand, direct eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as they seem willing to engage openly and maintain a connection during the interaction. On the other hand, it could be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and to mask any dishonesty, as some individuals know that sustained eye contact is often associated with sincerity. Their occasional gaze downwards also invites multiple interpretations. This behavior might indicate discomfort or internal reflection as they carefully consider their truthful response, or it could suggest evasiveness and an attempt to avoid direct scrutiny while constructing a deceptive narrative. Nodding during conversation similarly carries dual implications. It may signal genuine agreement and active listening, reinforcing their truthful engagement in the dialogue. Conversely, it could be a rehearsed tactic to convey agreement and persuade the interlocutor of their sincerity, even if their words are untrue. Ultimately, these visible behaviors need to be understood within the broader context of the interaction and baseline behavior of the individual, as they could either align with honest communication or serve as subtle cues in a deceptive performance.

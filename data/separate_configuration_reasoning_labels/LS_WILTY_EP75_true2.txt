The subject’s raised eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. On one hand, this gesture might signal surprise or disbelief, which could indicate that they are reacting genuinely to something unexpected and therefore being truthful. Conversely, raised eyebrows could also be a subconscious attempt to feign innocence or amplify emotional responses, thus potentially masking deceit. Similarly, the lips being retracted could suggest tension or stress, possibly stemming from the pressure of fabricating or concealing information. Yet, this expression might equally be attributed to nonverbal emphasis during communication or an involuntary reaction linked to concentration, rather than deception. The upward gaze is another behavior open to dual interpretations; it could reflect mental distancing or an attempt to construct a narrative, which might hint at dishonesty. Alternatively, looking upward may be a natural information retrieval tactic as the individual recalls truthful memories or processes their thoughts. Each of these behaviors, when isolated, is ambiguous and may both support or challenge the assumption of deception, underscoring the importance of considering the broader situational and communicative context before drawing conclusions.

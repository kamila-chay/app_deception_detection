The person’s lip corners turning down can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, this subtle downward movement might suggest discomfort or unhappiness, potentially signaling unease that aligns with concealing or distorting information. On the other hand, this expression could simply reflect genuine sadness, frustration, or concentration unrelated to deceit, highlighting an emotional state rather than an intention to mislead. Meanwhile, the direct gaze towards the interlocutor also presents a dual narrative. Maintaining eye contact might indicate sincerity and openness, as many people associate steady gaze with honesty and confidence. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate strategy employed to appear truthful and divert suspicion during deception. Thus, the observed behaviors of lip corners turning down and sustained gaze towards the interlocutor, while potentially indicative of either honesty or deception, require a broader contextual understanding to avoid premature conclusions.

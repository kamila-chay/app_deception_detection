The subject’s consistent gaze towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways when considering possible deception. On one hand, maintaining eye contact may suggest confidence and a desire to establish trust, which could be indicative of truthfulness. Engaging the listener directly often reflects openness and an intention to communicate sincerely. On the other hand, such focused eye contact might also be a deliberate strategy to mask deceit, as some individuals consciously use steady gaze to appear credible and avoid suspicion. This behavior could potentially be rehearsed to counteract typical signs of dishonesty, making it less spontaneous and more calculated.

Conversely, the lack of diversion from the interlocutor’s eyes might also be a sign of discomfort or stress often associated with deception, where the individual overcompensates by holding eye contact excessively in an attempt to convince. Yet, it is equally plausible that the person’s natural communication style involves strong eye engagement, reflecting cultural norms or personality traits unrelated to truthfulness. Therefore, without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, the meaning of the subject’s gaze remains ambiguous, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive assessment rather than drawing conclusions from a single observable behavior.

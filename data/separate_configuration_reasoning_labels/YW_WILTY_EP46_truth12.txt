The subject’s facial expressions, including frowning eyebrows paired with raised eyebrows, present an interesting combination that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, the frown might suggest concern or discomfort, potentially signaling internal conflict or uncertainty associated with deception. Conversely, the raised eyebrows can indicate surprise or an attempt to appear more open and honest, which may align with truthful communication. The downward turn of the lip corners further complicates the interpretation; this could reflect sadness or unease linked to dishonesty, but it might equally represent genuine emotional distress or contemplation.

Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor traditionally suggests engagement and sincerity, giving weight to the possibility of truthful behavior. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to feign confidence and deter suspicion when fabricating information, reminding us that gaze alone is an insufficient indicator without further context. The head moving backward may imply a subconscious distancing or discomfort, potentially indicative of evasiveness or reluctance to fully engage, which can be associated with deception. Yet, it may also simply reflect a natural response to feeling overwhelmed or needing to think more clearly.

The subject’s open gestures, such as palms up and arms open, are often interpreted as signs of openness and willingness to communicate honestly. This openness can be seen as an effort to build trust, which supports the notion of truthfulness. On the other hand, these gestures can be consciously employed to seem more transparent and disarming, possibly masking deceptive intent. Contrastingly, the presence of folded arms introduces an element of guardedness or defensiveness, which might hint at withholding information or discomfort with the conversation, potentially aligning with deceptive behavior. Alternatively, folded arms can be simply a comfortable resting posture or a response to feeling cold or physically closed off, without any connection to deceit.

Overall, these behaviors can be viewed through different lenses depending on the broader context, including cultural differences, the subject’s baseline behaviors, and the nature of the interaction. Without additional information, it remains ambiguous whether these cues are manifestations of honesty or indicators of deception, emphasizing the necessity of integrating multiple sources of evidence to draw a more reliable conclusion.

The subject maintains steady gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, direct eye contact is often associated with honesty and engagement, suggesting the person is being truthful and open in the interaction. However, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear credible and confident, potentially masking deceit. Similarly, the gesture of palms facing upward typically conveys openness and sincerity, which might reinforce the impression that the individual is transparent and forthcoming. Conversely, this same gesture can be consciously employed to elicit trust or to deflect suspicion, thus serving as a calculated behavior rather than an unconscious sign of truthfulness. Ultimately, without additional contextual information or corroborative behavioral cues, these actions alone provide ambiguous signals that could support either veracity or deception.

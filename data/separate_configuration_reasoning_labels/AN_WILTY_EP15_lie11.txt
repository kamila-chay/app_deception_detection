The subject’s gaze behavior alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and looking down, which can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. Maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and engagement, potentially indicating truthfulness, as the person seems open and willing to connect. Conversely, deliberate or prolonged gaze toward the interlocutor can also be a strategy to assert control, distract, or overcompensate in an attempt to convince, which might hint at deceptive intentions. Conversely, the moments when the subject looks down could be signs of discomfort or shame, which might suggest they are hiding something or feeling uneasy about what they are saying. However, looking down can also be a natural, reflective behavior where the person is simply gathering their thoughts or processing information, reflecting honesty and thoughtfulness rather than deceit. Without considering the wider situational cues and the individual’s baseline behavior, these gaze patterns alone cannot definitively confirm truthfulness or deception but require careful contextual analysis to draw more reliable conclusions.

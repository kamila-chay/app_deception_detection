The subject frequently directs their gaze towards the interlocutor, which could suggest engagement and openness, potentially signaling sincerity and a willingness to communicate honestly. This direct eye contact might indicate confidence in their statements and a desire to establish trust. Conversely, in some cases, sustained gaze can be a deliberate tactic to mask deception, as the person attempts to control the interaction and appear credible.

At times, their gaze shifts sideways, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways. From one perspective, these glances might reflect the cognitive effort involved in fabricating information or managing the narrative, possibly indicating discomfort or evasiveness. However, such gaze aversions can also simply be a natural part of processing thoughts, recalling memories, or momentarily disengaging from direct eye contact to gather composure, especially in emotionally charged situations.

Additionally, the subject turns their head to the side intermittently. This movement may be seen as a subtle distancing gesture, potentially signaling avoidance or reluctance to fully confront the questioning, which could be a sign of withholding or deception. On the other hand, a side-turn might merely be a spontaneous physical response to environmental stimuli or a shift in comfort level, unrelated to the veracity of the subject’s statements. This behavior might also reflect a thoughtful pause rather than avoidance.

Given these behaviors—gaze towards the interlocutor, sideways glances, and head turns—each could be indicative of truthfulness or deception depending on the broader interpersonal context, the individual’s baseline behavior, and the circumstances under which these actions occur. Therefore, while these cues provide valuable insights, their interpretation demands careful consideration of additional information to draw a more definitive conclusion.

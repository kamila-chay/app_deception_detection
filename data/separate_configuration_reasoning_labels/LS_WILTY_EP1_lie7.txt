The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, such a movement might reflect surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty and openness during communication, suggesting they are being truthful. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes be used as a subtle cue to mask uncertainty or to feign sincerity when fabricating information. Their lip corners turned downward might indicate discomfort or sadness, potentially signaling guilt or unease associated with deception. However, this expression could just as easily be a natural reaction to the topic discussed or a genuine emotional response unrelated to dishonesty. 

The subject’s gaze behavior offers equally nuanced interpretations. Direct eye contact with the interlocutor can be a sign of confidence and honesty, implying they are comfortable and forthcoming. Yet, prolonged gaze can also serve as a deliberate attempt to appear credible or manipulate perceptions. Meanwhile, shifting the gaze downward or sideways might suggest avoidance, which some theories link to deceptive behavior, as people may want to escape scrutiny. On the other hand, these gaze shifts could simply indicate cognitive processing or nervousness unrelated to deception, such as trying to remember a detail or feeling socially uncomfortable.

The head movements—tilting and turning to the side—add another layer of ambiguity. Tilting the head can be a sign of engagement and empathy, reinforcing the notion that they are invested in honest communication. Alternately, these gestures might be employed to create an impression of openness while internally strategizing a response. Finally, the individual’s arms folded across their chest may be interpreted as a defensive posture, potentially signifying resistance or discomfort that sometimes accompanies deceit. Yet, crossed arms can also be a habitual or comfortable resting position, or a way of self-soothing in a stressful environment without any deceptive intent.

Ultimately, each behavioral cue observed carries dual potential meanings, and without a broader context—including verbal content, baseline behaviors, and environmental factors—it remains challenging to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the subject’s statements. The interplay of these signals underscores the complexity of interpreting human behavior, especially in high-stakes or emotionally charged conversations.

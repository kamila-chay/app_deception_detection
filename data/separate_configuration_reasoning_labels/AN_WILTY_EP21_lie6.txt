The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or uncertainty, which could stem from fabricating information or feeling caught off guard by a question. Conversely, this same expression might simply indicate genuine curiosity, attentiveness, or a natural reaction to the conversational flow, without any deceptive intent. Their consistent gaze towards the interlocutor is another behavior that invites dual interpretations. Maintaining eye contact might suggest confidence and truthfulness, as they openly engage with the questioner, reinforcing their credibility. However, it could also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere and trustworthy, employed to mask dishonesty by simulating openness. The gesture of showing palms upward further underscores this ambiguity. Palms up is often associated with openness and honesty, hinting at transparency and a willingness to be understood truthfully. Yet, this gesture can also be consciously used to persuade or disarm suspicion, making it a potentially calculated maneuver to conceal deception. Ultimately, without the broader context—including verbal content, baseline behaviors, and situational factors—it is challenging to conclusively interpret these actions as indicators of truthfulness or deception, emphasizing the need for a holistic assessment.

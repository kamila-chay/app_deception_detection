The subject’s facial expression, characterized by lip corners turning down and lips protruding, can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, such expressions may suggest discomfort or tension, potentially indicating that the person is experiencing some degree of emotional distress commonly associated with deceptive behavior. Conversely, these same movements could simply reflect concentration or a natural resting expression unrelated to deceit. The chin movements, alternating between upward and downward, further contribute to this ambiguity. An upward chin might be seen as a sign of defensiveness or resistance, which could correlate with evasiveness, whereas a downward tilt of the chin might indicate submission or contemplation, possibly pointing to sincerity or uncertainty rather than deception.

Eye behavior adds another layer of complexity. The subject’s direct gaze toward the interlocutor can be interpreted as a sign of openness and honesty, demonstrating engagement and transparency. However, it could also be a deliberate attempt to establish trust or to mask nervousness. The occasional gaze upward and sideways raises similar dual interpretations: averted gazes might suggest evasion or fabrication, yet they could just as easily reflect an effort to recall information or navigate internal thoughts. This is particularly relevant when considering cultural differences related to eye contact norms.

The dynamics of the head movements—moving forward and backward, tilting, side-turning, and lifting up—can be equally ambiguous. Moving the head forward may indicate interest or a desire to connect, potentially reinforcing the notion of truthful engagement. Conversely, it might be perceived as a subtle form of advancing intrusion to dominate the conversation or distract from uncomfortable topics. Similarly, a head moving backward might signal withdrawal or defensiveness, which some might associate with deception, but it can also simply be a natural reaction to feeling overwhelmed or needing to think. Tilting or turning the head could reveal curiosity or openness, but they might also serve as subconscious attempts to avoid direct confrontation or to create psychological distance.

In sum, each of these observable behaviors carries possible interpretations that could support either truthfulness or deception. Without additional context—such as baseline behavior, verbal content, or environmental factors—it remains challenging to draw definitive conclusions based solely on these nonverbal cues. A holistic approach, considering the interplay of these signals within the broader communicative context, would provide a more reliable foundation for assessment.

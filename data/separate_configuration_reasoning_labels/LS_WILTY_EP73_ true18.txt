The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can carry multiple interpretations. In some contexts, raised eyebrows might signal surprise or incredulity, possibly reflecting genuine reactions to the conversation and thus supporting their truthfulness. Conversely, this behavior could also be a deliberate attempt to feign innocence or emphasize honesty, potentially serving as a subtle cue of deception. Similarly, their gaze directed towards the interlocutor is notable. Maintaining eye contact can indicate confidence and openness, suggesting that the person is engaged and transparent in the dialogue. However, sustained gaze may sometimes be employed strategically to deflect suspicion or create a convincing front, which could mask underlying dishonesty. Ultimately, these behaviors—raising eyebrows and steady eye contact—must be assessed within the broader context of the interaction and the individual's baseline mannerisms to form a more accurate judgment regarding truthfulness or deception.

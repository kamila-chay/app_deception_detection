The subject's lips are retracted, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways. This expression might suggest tension or discomfort, which could be indicative of someone withholding the truth or feeling uneasy about their narrative. Conversely, it might simply reflect concentration or an emotional response unrelated to deception. Their chin moving upwards can similarly be seen through a dual lens: it might signal defiance or an attempt to assert dominance during a stressful interaction, potentially defensive behavior when concealing information. On the other hand, it could equally represent confidence or earnestness in their statements, depending on their baseline demeanor.

The direct gaze toward the interlocutor is another behavior rich in ambiguity. Maintaining eye contact may imply honesty and engagement, reinforcing the idea that they have nothing to hide. However, it might also be a calculated effort to appear sincere and present a convincing facade, as some deceivers deliberately maintain eye contact to avoid suspicion. The shaking of the head adds further complexity—this might demonstrate genuine disagreement or a conscientious denial of falsehood, yet it can also be a subtle involuntary cue reflecting internal conflict or stress associated with deception.

Their hands touching the head or body can be viewed as a sign of nervousness or self-soothing, which some interpret as potential indicators of deception due to increased cognitive load or anxiety. Alternatively, these gestures might be habitual or culturally influenced ways of communicating or simply expressing discomfort unrelated to deceit. Finally, the palms being up may suggest openness and a willingness to communicate truthfully, possibly reflecting transparency. Conversely, open palms can sometimes be a rehearsed gesture meant to simulate honesty and deflect suspicion.

In sum, each behavior observed carries plausible interpretations on both sides of the truthfulness spectrum. Without further contextual information, such as baseline behavior patterns, verbal content, and environmental cues, it remains challenging to definitively categorize these signals as indicators of deception or truthfulness.

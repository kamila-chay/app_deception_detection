The subject’s lip corners are turned downward, which can often be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or displeasure, potentially indicative of someone who is feeling uneasy about the truthfulness of their statements. However, this expression could equally reflect genuine sadness, frustration, or concentration, rather than deception. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, a behavior that might suggest confidence and openness, thereby supporting an interpretation that they are being truthful. Conversely, maintaining direct eye contact might also be a deliberate attempt to appear credible and mask deceit, as some individuals consciously use eye contact to enhance believability. The backward movement of the head might be perceived as a physical distancing cue, possibly signaling discomfort or a subconscious desire to create space due to internal conflict or dishonesty. Alternatively, this gesture could simply be a natural reaction to the conversational flow or a defensive posture unrelated to deceptive intentions. Finally, the subject’s folded arms could be read as a protective barrier, hinting at defensiveness or closed-off emotions that might align with deceptive behavior. On the other hand, arm folding is also a common and comfortable resting position that may simply reflect a person’s habitual posture or an effort to maintain composure. Taken together, these behaviors offer ambiguous cues that necessitate additional context and interaction patterns to reliably assess whether the individual is being truthful or deceptive.

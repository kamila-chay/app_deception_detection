The subject’s gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and occasionally looking down, behaviors that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. A steady gaze toward the interlocutor might be seen as a sign of openness and engagement, suggesting that the person is confident and truthful. However, maintaining eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere and mask deceit, especially if the individual is consciously attempting to convince or manipulate. Conversely, looking down could indicate discomfort or shame, potentially signaling that the person is withholding information or feeling guilty about being deceptive. Yet, this downward gaze might simply reflect momentary reflection, concentration, or even cultural norms that discourage direct eye contact as a sign of respect. Without additional behavioral cues or contextual information, these gaze patterns alone do not definitively reveal truthfulness or deception, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation to better understand the underlying motivations.

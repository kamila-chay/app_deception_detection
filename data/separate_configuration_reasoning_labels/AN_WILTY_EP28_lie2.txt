The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners might suggest genuine warmth and comfort in the interaction, potentially signaling truthfulness. However, such smiles can also be consciously or unconsciously employed to mask discomfort or to persuade, which could indicate deceptive intent depending on the context. Their action of raising eyebrows could reflect surprise or engagement, signaling honesty and openness, yet the same gesture might be used deliberately to feign innocence or innocence, complicating the interpretation.

Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor often conveys confidence and sincerity, yet it can also be a strategic choice to appear trustworthy while fabricating information. Conversely, the occasional gaze downward may indicate discomfort or evasiveness, which some might associate with deception. Still, looking down could simply reflect reflection or difficulty recalling details, rather than deceit. The subject’s head held up typically suggests self-assurance and straightforwardness, but this posture could be adopted to project dominance or control, possibly concealing underlying uncertainty.

Their hands touching their head or body can be read as signs of nervousness commonly linked to deception, as these self-soothing gestures might help manage stress caused by untruthfulness. Yet, such behaviors may equally be habitual or related to natural discomfort in social situations, without any deceptive intent. Overall, without additional context, each of these behaviors remains open to multiple interpretations; the true nature of their honesty or deception can only be better gauged by considering the full situational background and complementary cues.

The subject’s lips are retracted, which can often suggest discomfort or tension, potentially signaling that they may be withholding information or experiencing stress associated with deception. Conversely, this behavior could simply reflect an emotional state such as frustration or concentration, or even a momentary facial expression unrelated to dishonesty. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, a gesture that might imply confidence and openness typically associated with truthfulness, as maintaining eye contact can suggest a willingness to engage transparently. However, sustained or intense eye contact may also be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate, serving as a shield to obscure internal unease. Meanwhile, the subject’s arms are open, generally interpreted as a welcoming and non-defensive posture that might indicate sincerity and honesty. Yet, open arms can be a conscious or unconscious strategy to build trust and appear more credible, even if the underlying intent is deceptive. Ultimately, without additional context or baseline behaviors, each of these cues could be indicative of both truthfulness and deceit, underscoring the importance of considering the broader interaction and corroborating evidence before drawing conclusions.

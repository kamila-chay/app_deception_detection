The subject’s behavior, including raising their eyebrows, can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, raised eyebrows might signify surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity and engagement, which could suggest honesty. Conversely, this same gesture could be a subtle manipulation to appear more credible or to distract from uncomfortable truths. The exaggerated closing of the eyes similarly holds dual interpretations: it might indicate genuine emotional response or relief, signaling authenticity, yet it could also be a controlled display intended to mask internal discomfort or feigned emotions. When the subject lowers their chin, it might convey submission, thoughtfulness, or humility—traits associated with truthful communication; however, it could equally be a defensive posture meant to shield oneself or to avoid scrutiny during deception. Their gaze behavior adds further complexity: maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor might demonstrate confidence and openness, often linked to honesty, but alternatively, it could be a conscious effort to convince or dominate the interaction by a deceptive individual. Glancing down, on the other hand, might reflect introspection or processing of truthful thoughts, but it might also reveal avoidance or internal conflict commonly associated with dishonesty. The forward movement of the head can imply active listening and engagement, hinting at genuine interest and truthfulness; at the same time, it might be a strategic move to assert dominance or control in the conversation, possibly masking deceit. Lastly, the sideways turn of the head could represent curiosity or consideration, suggestive of authenticity, but it might also be a nonverbal cue of evasion or discomfort, which can accompany deceptive responses. Without additional context, each of these behaviors holds equally plausible explanations for truthfulness and deception, underscoring the importance of considering the broader interaction and baseline behaviors before drawing conclusions.

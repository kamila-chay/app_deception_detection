The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This gesture might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty in their statements, which can be a natural response during truthful communication. Conversely, raised eyebrows might also serve as a deliberate tactic to manipulate the listener’s perception, perhaps to feign sincerity or create a façade of openness. Meanwhile, their direct gaze towards the interlocutor similarly presents dual possibilities. Steady eye contact often indicates confidence and straightforwardness, reinforcing trustworthiness. Yet, maintaining prolonged eye contact can also be a learned strategy aimed at masking deceit, as deceivers may overcompensate by trying to appear more convincing. The behavior of rubbing their hands adds another layer of complexity; this could reflect internal nervousness commonly associated with withholding information or fabricating details. However, it might just as easily be a habitual gesture or a comforting action in response to the social pressure of the interaction. Additionally, touching the head or other parts of the body might suggest discomfort or anxiety, potentially triggered by the cognitive load involved in deception, but it could also be a benign self-soothing mechanism with no relation to the truthfulness of their statements. Without broader contextual cues, such as baseline behavior or situational factors, these nonverbal signals alone cannot definitively indicate deception or honesty, underscoring the need for a comprehensive assessment.

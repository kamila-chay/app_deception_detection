The individual’s raised eyebrows might suggest a moment of surprise or emphasis intended to persuade, which could be consistent with genuine reactions or an attempt to feign sincerity. Conversely, this same gesture might be employed strategically to elicit trust or to momentarily divert attention from a deceptive narrative. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor generally signals engagement and openness, often associated with truthfulness; however, such eye contact can also be deliberately maintained to create an illusion of honesty, masking underlying deception. Meanwhile, the occasional upward gaze could indicate the cognitive effort of recalling truthful memories, yet it might equally reflect the mental construction of a fabricated story. The folded arms present another dual possibility: they may simply denote comfort or a habitual posture, but they could also signify defensiveness or reluctance to fully disclose information. Finally, the subtle shrug might convey uncertainty or a genuine lack of knowledge, though it could similarly serve as a nonverbal tactic to downplay responsibility or deflect scrutiny. Ultimately, interpreting these behaviors demands careful consideration of the broader context and individual baselines to discern whether they support truthfulness or deception.

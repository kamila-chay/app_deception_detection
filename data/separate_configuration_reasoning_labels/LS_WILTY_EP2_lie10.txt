The subject’s gaze towards the interlocutor may be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact often conveys confidence and honesty, suggesting that the person is engaged and truthful. Conversely, in some cases, direct eye contact can be a strategic effort to appear sincere and conceal deception. The moments when their gaze shifts downward could signal discomfort or evasion, potentially hinting at fabrication or internal conflict. However, such downward glances might equally represent momentary reflection or an attempt to recall accurate information, rather than an intentional avoidance or deceit. The observed head side-turn could be viewed as a nonverbal cue of distancing or discomfort, possibly signifying insecurity related to hiding something. Yet, it might also simply illustrate natural conversational dynamics or the person’s way of processing information, rather than indicating dishonest intent. The openness of their arms can be a sign of transparency and openness, fostering trust in their words, but it could also be a deliberate posture designed to project sincerity and mask nervousness. Ultimately, these behavioral indicators alone do not conclusively confirm truthfulness or deception; a broader context and additional cues should be considered to arrive at a more substantiated assessment.

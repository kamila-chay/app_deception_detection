The subject’s lips are protruded, a gesture that may suggest tension or discomfort, potentially indicative of someone trying to withhold information or craft a response carefully. Conversely, this lip movement could simply be a habitual or thoughtful expression, reflecting concentration rather than deceit. Their chin moves upwards, which might be interpreted as a subtle sign of defensiveness or assertion, possibly signaling an attempt to mask uncertainty or bolster credibility. Yet this upward motion might also denote confidence or engagement in the conversation, reflecting openness rather than concealment.

Their gaze remains directed towards the interlocutor, a behavior that can imply sincerity and attentiveness, often associated with honest communication. However, maintaining steady eye contact might equally be a deliberate strategy to appear trustworthy while hiding something, as some deceptive individuals are known to overcompensate with prolonged gaze. Meanwhile, the head moving backward could be read as a subconscious distancing gesture, perhaps signaling discomfort or a desire to create psychological space in response to stress related to deception. On the other hand, it might simply express surprise, skepticism, or a natural reaction to the flow of dialogue.

A turn of the head to the side is another ambiguous cue; it could indicate evasion or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation when fabricating information. Yet, it might also denote reflective thinking or a pause for consideration, signaling that the person is thoughtfully processing the exchange. The palms held up often denote openness and honesty, suggesting the subject is being forthcoming and transparent. In contrast, this same gesture could be employed strategically to signal innocence and deflect suspicion, masking potential dishonesty beneath an outward display of openness.

Finally, their arms are open, a posture commonly associated with receptiveness and straightforwardness, which might be interpreted as a sign of truthful engagement. Nevertheless, this openness could be a conscious effort to appear non-threatening and credible, thereby concealing ulterior motives. Given these multifaceted behaviors, interpreting the subject’s truthfulness requires careful consideration of the broader conversational context and additional verbal and nonverbal cues to form a more accurate assessment.

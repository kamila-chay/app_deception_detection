The subject’s raised eyebrows may suggest surprise or incredulity, potentially signaling an unconscious reaction to fabricating or adjusting a narrative in real time. Conversely, this expression could simply reflect genuine surprise or emphasis on a particular point, underscoring engagement rather than deceit. Similarly, their direct gaze toward the interlocutor might be interpreted as an attempt to establish credibility and maintain control over the interaction, which in some cases aligns with deceptive behavior aimed at convincing the listener. However, sustained eye contact can equally indicate confidence and sincerity, demonstrating openness and willingness to engage honestly. Without broader context—such as baseline behaviors, speech content, or emotional cues—it remains challenging to conclusively interpret these actions, as both truthfulness and deception can manifest through similar outward behaviors depending on the individual and situation.

The subject’s frowning eyebrows could be interpreted as a sign of concentration or discomfort, potentially indicating they are struggling to maintain a fabricated story. However, such a facial expression might also simply reflect genuine confusion or deep thought, unrelated to deception. The exaggerated mouth opening and protruded lips may suggest an attempt to emphasize or dramatize their statements, which some might view as a sign of overcompensation often seen in deceptive behavior. Conversely, these same gestures could be natural expressions of surprise or genuine emotional reaction, especially if the topic is unexpected or sensitive.

The upward movement of the chin can be perceived as a subtle display of defensiveness or an unconscious attempt to assert control, which could imply unease linked to dishonesty. On the other hand, it might be a habitual or culturally influenced gesture that carries no deceptive connotation. Their gaze behavior is particularly nuanced: maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor might be an effort to appear credible and sincere, while intermittently looking down could reflect guilt or evasion associated with lying. Yet, these same gaze shifts could be indicative of cognitive processing or recall as the subject tries to retrieve accurate information.

Head movements, including turning to the side and looking upwards, add another layer of complexity. A side-turn of the head might be interpreted as a subtle avoidance of direct engagement or emotional distancing, which sometimes correlates with deception. Alternatively, this movement might serve to gather thoughts or manage the flow of conversation in a completely truthful exchange. Similarly, lifting the head upwards might signal confidence or a search for additional visual or mental cues, but it could also represent stubbornness or defiance commonly observed during deceptive interactions.

Ultimately, these behaviors could be read in multiple ways depending on the broader situational context, the individual's baseline behavior, and the content of the conversation. Without additional information, it is challenging to definitively ascribe these signals exclusively to truthfulness or deception.

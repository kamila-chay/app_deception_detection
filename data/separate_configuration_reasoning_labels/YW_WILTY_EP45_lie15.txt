The subject is raising their eyebrows, a gesture that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. This motion might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, signaling engagement and openness. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle signal to manipulate or persuade, potentially indicating a rehearsed or insincere response. Their lip corners are turned upward, which may convey genuine warmth and friendliness, often associated with truthful communication. However, a smile can also be strategically employed to mask discomfort or to deflect suspicion, complicating its interpretation.

Their gaze shifts between making direct eye contact with the interlocutor, looking downward, and glancing sideways. Maintaining direct gaze is typically seen as a sign of confidence and truthfulness, yet in some cases, it can be consciously maintained as a method to appear credible. Looking down might indicate discomfort or guilt, but it can equally reflect reflective thought or modesty. Sideways glances may suggest evasiveness and attempts to avoid scrutiny, though they might also be signs of cognitive processing as the person tries to recall information.

The individual’s head tilting could signal empathy and openness, suggesting a genuine desire to connect, but it might also be a rehearsed gesture to appear more trustworthy or engaging. Their hands exhibit scratching and other touches to the body and head, actions often linked to nervousness or stress, which could stem from the exertion of fabricating a story. Alternatively, these movements might simply be habitual gestures or responses to physical discomfort without any deceptive intent.

Finally, the subject displays palms turned upward, a gesture commonly interpreted as a sign of honesty and openness. Nevertheless, palms-up positions can also be consciously adopted to project sincerity when one is, in fact, concealing the truth. Given this array of behaviors, each bearing plausible interpretations on both ends of the truth-deception spectrum, it is crucial to consider the broader context and baseline behavior patterns before drawing any firm conclusions about the person’s veracity.

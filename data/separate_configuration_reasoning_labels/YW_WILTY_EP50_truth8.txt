The individual’s raising of their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it may signify surprise or emphasis, potentially reflecting genuine engagement or honesty in their communication. Conversely, raised eyebrows might be a subtle attempt to feign innocence or exaggerate emotions, which could be a tactic used in deception to appear more credible. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor is similarly ambiguous. Maintaining eye contact often signals confidence and truthfulness, suggesting they are forthcoming with information. However, it can also be a deliberate strategy to control the interaction and project sincerity, even when fabricating details. The palms-up gesture, meanwhile, traditionally conveys openness and honesty, as if inviting trust or demonstrating transparency. Yet, this same gesture can be employed manipulatively to elicit sympathy or mitigate suspicion when someone is being deceptive. Without additional context or corroborating cues, each of these behaviors could plausibly indicate either truthfulness or deception, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive assessment before drawing conclusions.

The subject’s smile and the upward movement of their lip corners could suggest genuine positivity and engagement, indicating truthfulness. However, these same expressions might also be consciously controlled or exaggerated to mask discomfort or to appear more credible, signaling potential deception. Their exaggerated eye closing could be interpreted as a sign of tension or an attempt to suppress genuine emotions, which might hint at dishonesty. Conversely, it could be simply a natural blink or an involuntary facial expression without deceptive intent.

Maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor often reflects confidence and openness, supporting the possibility that the person is being truthful. Yet, sustained eye contact can also be a deliberate strategy to appear sincere while fabricating information. Similarly, the intermittent upward gaze might be related to recall processes, as people often look up when trying to access memories, which would align with honesty. Alternatively, gaze directed upwards can sometimes indicate distancing from the current conversation or cognitive efforts to construct a false narrative.

Nodding and head tilting generally signal receptiveness and empathy, suggesting the person is engaged and truthful. Nonetheless, these same behaviors can be employed purposefully to encourage agreement or to create rapport, which may be a tactic used in deception. The combination of head side-turn and head up might manifest openness and thoughtfulness, but it could also be a subtle way of avoiding direct confrontation or signaling uncertainty.

The subject’s hands scratching and touching their head or body could reflect nervousness or internal conflict, potentially pointing toward deceptive behavior. On the other hand, such gestures may simply be habitual or self-soothing actions unrelated to honesty. Similarly, palms held up typically convey openness and honesty; however, they could also be used manipulatively to project sincerity.

Ultimately, each behavior observed carries dual potential interpretations that depend heavily on the broader context, baseline behavior, and the dynamics of the interaction. Without additional information, it remains equally plausible that these cues indicate either truthfulness or deception.

The subject maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which can be interpreted in multiple ways. This direct eye contact might suggest confidence and honesty, as they appear open and engaged in the conversation. Conversely, sustained eye contact may also be a deliberate tactic to convince or manipulate, intending to mask deceit by projecting sincerity. At times, the subject’s gaze shifts upward, a behavior often associated with cognitive processing or memory retrieval, potentially indicating they are thoughtfully recalling information, which supports the notion of truthfulness. However, this upward gaze can also be seen as a potential sign of fabrication or constructing a response, as individuals sometimes look away or upward when inventing details.

The subject also shrugs during the interaction, a gesture that can convey uncertainty or a lack of knowledge, implying they are being candid about their limitations or admitting ignorance. Alternatively, the shrug might serve as a dismissive gesture or an attempt to deflect responsibility, potentially signaling evasiveness or discomfort with the topic at hand. Because these behaviors can be context-dependent, assessing their meaning requires considering the broader situation, including verbal content, baseline behaviors, and other nonverbal cues, to arrive at a more accurate understanding of the subject’s truthfulness.

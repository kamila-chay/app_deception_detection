The subject’s chin movements, alternating between upward and downward, can be interpreted in multiple ways. Raising the chin might suggest confidence or an attempt to appear assertive, possibly to reinforce a truthful statement. Conversely, it could also be a subconscious display of defensiveness or an effort to mask discomfort, hinting at potential deceit. Lowering the chin might indicate submission or contemplation, which could reflect sincerity and openness. However, it might equally reveal hesitation or an attempt to retreat from direct engagement, sometimes observed in deceptive behavior.

Their gaze behavior—maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor while intermittently glancing sideways—also presents dual interpretations. Sustained eye contact often signals honesty and engagement, demonstrating a willingness to connect and be transparent. Yet, continuous eye contact can be consciously maintained by someone fabricating a story in an effort to seem convincing. The occasional sideways glances might suggest evasiveness or searching for a mental escape when fabricating details, but these same glances can also reflect genuine cognitive processing and the effort to recall accurate information.

The subject’s nodding and turning of the head to the side can convey either affirmation or contemplation. Nodding typically aligns with agreement and understanding, possibly reinforcing truthful communication. Nevertheless, it can also be a strategic behavior to ingratiate oneself or encourage the interlocutor to accept a falsehood. A head side-turn might show openness or curiosity, supporting a truthful narrative, yet it can simultaneously signal discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct confrontation when being deceptive.

Finally, the presence of scratching and touching their head or body may hint at underlying nervousness. Such self-directed behaviors are often associated with anxiety stemming from dishonesty or the mental strain of maintaining a fabrication. On the other hand, they might simply be habitual gestures or reactions to environmental factors such as discomfort or stress unrelated to deception. Ultimately, these behaviors require careful contextual consideration to differentiate between innocent mannerisms and potential signs of deception.

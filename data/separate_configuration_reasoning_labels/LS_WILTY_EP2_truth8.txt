The subject’s raising of their eyebrows can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. It might signal surprise or a subtle attempt to emphasize sincerity, suggesting openness and engagement in the conversation. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes serve as a subconscious cue to mask discomfort or uncertainty, possibly indicating an internal conflict with the truth they are presenting. Their lip corners turning downward and lips protruding together present another duality; such expressions could reflect genuine sadness, frustration, or concentration, thereby supporting the notion of truthful emotional involvement. On the other hand, these same lip movements might be deliberate or unconscious signs of tension and guardedness, potentially hinting at deliberate withholding or distortion of information.

The subject’s direct gaze toward the interlocutor is generally understood as a sign of confidence and honesty, promoting trust and transparency. Yet, an unwavering gaze can also be employed strategically to distract or assert dominance during a deceptive exchange, suggesting that the subject may be attempting to control the interaction to mask deception. Complementing this, the subtle forward movement of the head combined with a head tilt shows engagement and attentiveness, which could be indicators of sincere interest and openness. However, these head movements might also function as rehearsed or learned behaviors designed to project credibility and empathy, despite underlying deception.

Given the complexity of these behaviors, they should not be viewed in isolation. Each could imply both truthful involvement or deceptive intent, making it essential to consider the overall narrative, baseline behaviors, and situational context before drawing definitive conclusions.

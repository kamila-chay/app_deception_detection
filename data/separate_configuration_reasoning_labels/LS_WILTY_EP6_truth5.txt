The subject’s raised eyebrows could signal surprise or emphasis, potentially pointing to an attempt to convince or distract, which might suggest deception. Conversely, this gesture may simply reflect genuine surprise or engagement in the conversation, indicating honesty. Their direct gaze towards the interlocutor often conveys confidence and transparency, yet in some contexts, such steady eye contact may be consciously maintained to mask discomfort or to appear truthful when fabricating information. In contrast, their moments of looking down could imply evasion or guilty feelings commonly associated with deceit. However, downward gaze might also be a natural response to introspection or recollection, especially when the person is thoughtfully considering their words. Similarly, the sideways gaze might indicate discomfort or an effort to avoid scrutiny, potentially hinting at dishonesty. On the other hand, it could be a simple mannerism or a way to process information without feeling overwhelmed by direct eye contact.

The forward movement of the head might be interpreted as an attempt to assert control of the conversation or to emphasize a point, which could be a tactic used in deception. Alternatively, it could signal genuine interest or eagerness in the topic being discussed. Conversely, when the head moves backward, it might be a defensive reaction signaling skepticism or a desire to distance oneself, which some might associate with concealment of the truth. Yet, this motion can also reflect surprise or natural physical repositioning, unrelated to any intent to deceive. Tilting of the head may indicate curiosity or confusion, potentially reflecting the cognitive load involved in fabricating responses. However, it might equally demonstrate genuine attentiveness and openness. When the subject shakes their head, it is frequently seen as a denial or rejection, possibly used to deny false accusations or falsify claims. Yet, it might simply be an honest expression of disagreement or disbelief.

Lastly, their hands touching their head or body could be interpreted as signs of nervousness or self-soothing behaviors, often linked to the stress of deception. Conversely, these gestures might also be habitual or culturally influenced actions with no bearing on truthfulness. Without further contextual information, it remains challenging to definitively attribute these behaviors to either deception or honesty, underscoring the necessity of a holistic evaluation that integrates verbal cues, baseline behaviors, and situational factors.

The individual’s direct gaze toward the interlocutor may be interpreted in different ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, sustained eye contact can suggest honesty and openness, indicating that the person is engaged and confident in what they are communicating. Conversely, it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear trustworthy or to mask deceit, as some individuals maintain strong eye contact to overcompensate for feelings of guilt or fabrication. Similarly, the palms-up gesture is often seen as a sign of sincerity and willingness to be transparent, which might support an interpretation of truthfulness by signaling openness and non-defensiveness. However, this same gesture can be employed strategically to evoke empathy or to persuade, potentially functioning as a subtle tool of manipulation. Without additional contextual cues or behavioral information, these indicators alone cannot definitively clarify whether the person is being truthful or deceptive, underscoring the importance of considering the whole interaction and other signals before drawing conclusions.

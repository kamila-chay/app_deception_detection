The individual’s scowl could be interpreted as a sign of frustration or discomfort that might arise from the stress of fabricating information. However, it could just as easily reflect genuine displeasure or confusion about the topic being discussed, without any deceptive intent. Their raised eyebrows may signal surprise or disbelief, which might suggest that they are reacting to unexpected questions while trying to maintain a fabricated story. Conversely, raised eyebrows can also indicate genuine engagement or an attempt to better understand the interlocutor’s perspective, demonstrating honesty rather than deceit.

Maintaining gaze towards the interlocutor often indicates confidence and openness, which supports the possibility that they are being truthful. However, steady eye contact in some cases can be consciously maintained as a strategy to build trust while hiding inconsistencies beneath the surface. The head tilting behavior adds another layer of complexity; it might be a subconscious cue of uncertainty or attempting to process information while devising a response. Yet, head tilting is also commonly associated with active listening and genuine interest, pointing to a truthful disposition.

Further, head shaking could be interpreted as a nonverbal denial or rejection, potentially reflecting an effort to distance themselves from a lie they have just told. On the other hand, it can simply be a natural reaction to disagreement or an emphatic gesture supporting their verbal statements. Lastly, shrugging can convey ambiguity or an unwillingness to commit, which might hint at evasiveness tied to deception. Alternatively, a shrug might just express honest uncertainty or lack of knowledge about a particular detail. Ultimately, these behaviors require additional contextual information to accurately determine whether the individual is being truthful or deceptive.

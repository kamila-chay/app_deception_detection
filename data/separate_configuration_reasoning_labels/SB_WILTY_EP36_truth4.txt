The subject's raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might signify surprise or emphasis, potentially revealing an attempt to highlight honesty or convey sincerity. Conversely, raised eyebrows can sometimes be a subtle signal of doubt or incredulity, which might suggest they are masking uncertainty or discomfort associated with deception. Their chin moving upwards similarly offers dual interpretations. It might reflect confidence and openness, reinforcing the impression of truthfulness, or alternatively, it could be perceived as a defensive posture, subtly distancing themselves from the topic at hand.

The subject’s gaze patterns further complicate the analysis. Direct gaze towards the interlocutor often conveys engagement and transparency, supporting the possibility that they are being truthful. However, in some contexts, sustained eye contact may be consciously maintained to compensate for deceit, as individuals try to appear credible. Similarly, their glance downward could indicate momentary hesitation or fear of detection, which might hint at deception, yet it can also be a natural pausing gesture used to gather thoughts or recall accurate information.

Nodding while speaking usually acts as an affirmation, signaling agreement or honesty, suggesting the subject is earnest in their communication. On the other hand, nodding might serve as a learned social cue to persuade or elicit agreement from the listener, potentially masking underlying falsehoods. Finally, the openness of their arms generally projects approachability and openness, characteristics consistent with truthful behavior. Nevertheless, open arm gestures can also be deliberately employed to foster trust and disarm suspicion, which could be part of a deceptive strategy.

In sum, each behavior provides plausible evidence on both sides of the truthfulness spectrum. Without additional context or corroborating cues, these nonverbal signals alone remain ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.

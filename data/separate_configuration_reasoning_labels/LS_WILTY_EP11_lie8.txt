The person’s lip corners turning upwards might suggest a genuine smile, which could indicate sincerity and comfort in the interaction. However, this same expression might also be a controlled, polite smile designed to mask true feelings or to manipulate the perception of honesty. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor generally reflects engagement and openness, often associated with truthful communication. On the other hand, maintaining eye contact can sometimes be a deliberate tactic to appear convincing and trustworthy when one is actually being deceptive.

The occasional sideways glance introduces further complexity to the interpretation. It could signal discomfort or evasiveness, traits often linked to deception when someone is trying to avoid direct confrontation or scrutiny. Conversely, such glances might simply reflect cognitive processing or attempts to recall information, showing the person is thoughtful rather than deceitful. Head tilting is another ambiguous cue; it often indicates interest and active listening, suggesting the person is engaged and sincere. Yet, this same gesture can be employed strategically to appear more agreeable or empathetic, potentially serving as a subtle tool to deflect suspicion.

Ultimately, these behaviors carry dual meanings depending on the broader context and baseline of the individual’s typical behavior patterns. Without additional information, it is difficult to conclusively label the person as truthful or deceptive solely based on these visible cues.

The subject’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, sustained eye contact might suggest honesty and engagement, reflecting a willingness to communicate openly. Conversely, it could also be an attempt to overcompensate for deceit, as some individuals use direct gaze strategically to appear credible. The forward movement of their head might indicate attentiveness and an eagerness to contribute to the conversation, which supports the notion of truthfulness. However, such a gesture could also be a subtle sign of assertiveness used to dominate or manipulate the interaction, potentially masking evasiveness.

Similarly, the backward movement of the head introduces ambiguity. This gesture might hint at discomfort or hesitation, possibly signaling evasiveness or the discomfort of fabricating information. Yet, it could equally be a natural, reflexive response, such as reacting to a sudden thought or physical sensation unrelated to deception. The subject’s head shaking adds another layer of complexity; a shake can express denial or disagreement, which could be straightforward if the subject is indeed truthful. On the other hand, it might serve as a defensive mechanism, intended to reinforce a false narrative convincingly.

Finally, the palms-up gesture is often associated with openness and honesty, symbolizing a lack of concealment or an appeal for trust. Nevertheless, in some contexts, this same gesture can be employed manipulatively, acting as a calculated display to elicit sympathy or persuade the listener despite dishonest intentions. Each of these behaviors—when viewed in isolation—can support contrasting interpretations of truthfulness or deception, underscoring the importance of considering the broader context, baseline behaviors, and corroborative evidence before drawing conclusions.

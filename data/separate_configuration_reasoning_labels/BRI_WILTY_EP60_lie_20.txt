The individual is raising their eyebrows, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, this expression might suggest surprise or emphasis, possibly signaling an attempt to convince or elicit trust from the interlocutor. Such a gesture can sometimes be associated with someone trying to appear more sincere or forthcoming. On the other hand, eyebrow raising could simply be a natural response to the conversation or a habitual mannerism that bears no relation to deceit. Without further context, it remains ambiguous whether this action reflects genuine emotion or a calculated attempt to influence perception.

Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways. Direct eye contact is often seen as a sign of honesty and engagement, suggesting openness and confidence in what is being communicated. However, it can also be consciously maintained to mask discomfort or to project credibility, especially if the individual is attempting to deceive. Conversely, the sideways glances could indicate avoidance or distraction, behaviors frequently linked with deception due to potential cognitive load or anxiety. Yet, these same sideways looks might simply reflect moments of reflection or efforts to recall information, rather than evasion or dishonesty.

Ultimately, these visible behaviors each carry dual interpretations that hinge heavily on the larger context, including the person’s baseline conduct, the conversation’s content, and other nonverbal cues. They could be indicators of truthful communication or subtle signs of deceit, but without additional information, any conclusion would remain speculative.

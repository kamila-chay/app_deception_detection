The subject’s chin moving upwards can be interpreted in multiple ways when assessing truthfulness. On one hand, this gesture might signal defensiveness or a subtle attempt to assert dominance, potentially reflecting discomfort with the topic and a desire to control the interaction, which could hint at deception. On the other hand, it could simply be a natural posture or a moment of reflection, not necessarily connected to any intent to deceive. Similarly, the direct gaze towards the interlocutor might suggest attentiveness and honesty, as sustained eye contact is often associated with confidence and openness. Contrary to that, an intense or prolonged gaze could also be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate, used strategically to mask deceit. Their nodding behavior could be read as a sign of agreement or encouragement, reinforcing their sincerity and eagerness to engage truthfully. Conversely, it might be a rehearsed response to reinforce false statements or persuade the listener, rather than a genuine expression of assent. Finally, the head shaking presents a similar duality. It may indicate disagreement or discomfort with certain points, which could suggest genuine reactions rather than fabricated ones. Conversely, it might be used deliberately to deny or distance oneself from the truth, serving as a nonverbal form of denial. Ultimately, without additional context, each of these behaviors offers plausible interpretations both for and against the subject’s truthfulness, underscoring the complexity of accurately assessing deception based solely on visible cues.

The individual’s raised eyebrows could be interpreted in multiple ways when considering the possibility of deception. On the one hand, this expression might signal surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, which can be a conscious effort to convince the interlocutor of truthfulness. On the other hand, raised eyebrows can also serve as a subtle cue to mask discomfort or uncertainty, hinting that the person might be fabricating or concealing information. Similarly, the downward movement of the chin can be viewed through dual lenses. It might reflect a natural gesture of humility or thoughtfulness, suggesting engagement and earnestness in the conversation. Conversely, this gesture could also indicate submission or an unconscious attempt to shield oneself, potentially revealing feelings of guilt or vulnerability tied to deception. Maintaining direct gaze toward the interlocutor further complicates the interpretation. A consistent gaze can project confidence and transparency, reinforcing the impression of honesty. However, sustained eye contact may also be intentionally employed as a strategic means to persuade and distract, masking underlying dishonesty. Ultimately, without additional context to frame these behaviors, each action remains ambiguous, equally supporting interpretations of both truthfulness and deception.

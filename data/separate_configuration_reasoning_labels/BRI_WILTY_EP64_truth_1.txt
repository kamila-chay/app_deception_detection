The subject’s lips are protruded, a behavior that can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the broader context. On one hand, lip protrusion may signal discomfort or tension, possibly arising from the internal strain of concealing information or fabricating details. This subtle expression might be a subconscious attempt to control or mask anxiety related to deception. On the other hand, such a gesture could simply reflect a moment of concentration, thoughtfulness, or even a habitual physical mannerism unrelated to truthfulness. It might indicate that the person is pondering their response carefully or reacting to a stimulus in the environment without any deceptive intent. Without additional cues or contextual factors, the protruded lips alone offer ambiguous insights; they may hint at guardedness or uncertainty, but could just as plausibly be an innocuous, nonverbal expression with no connection to honesty or deceit.

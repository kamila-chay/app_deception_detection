Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gazing directly at them most of the time, which feels natural rather than forced. They're also nodding along, which usually shows agreement or attentiveness, not deception. And that subtle smile—just the corners of their lips lifting up, not a big grin—isn't the kind of fake smile people often use when lying; it looks relaxed, like they're genuinely comfortable.  

I don't see any of the classic "tells" for lying either: no frowning, no nervous blinking, no avoiding eye contact (they even glance sideways once, but that's normal when thinking, not hiding). Their hands are still, and they're not fidgeting or covering their face—things liars sometimes do. The way they speak seems smooth, too, with no awkward pauses where they'd be scrambling for words.  

But honestly, I can't be 100% sure. Sometimes people smile when they're nervous—like if they're trying to seem calm while lying—but here the smile feels light, not strained. And the sideways glance? Could mean they're just processing what they're saying, not hiding anything. I've seen people who are really good at hiding stress, so maybe they're just practiced. Still, the overall vibe feels more like someone who's telling the truth: they're present, they're listening (hence the nodding and eye contact), and there's no tension in their body language.  

If I had to guess without knowing the context, I'd lean toward them being truthful. But I’d also say it's hard to rule out lying entirely—some people are just really good at faking it. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but based on what's visible here, the signs point more toward truth than deception.

Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm overall—they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact, fidgeting with objects, or making any obvious nervous gestures. The only thing I notice is that they scratch their hands a couple of times, like maybe they're itching or just rubbing their palms together absentmindedly. Honestly, it's hard to pin down whether that's a sign of lying or just... well, a habit.  

On one hand, I know some people do scratch when they're stressed or lying, so it *could* be a red flag. If they were making up a story, that little habit might be their body reacting to the pressure. But then again, scratching is super common—maybe their skin’s dry, or they just have a nervous twitch that has nothing to do with truthfulness. I’ve seen people scratch while answering totally honest questions, like when they’re trying to think of a word. Plus, there’s nothing else going on: no weird pauses, no forced smiles, no shifting in their seat. If they were lying, I’d expect more tells, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting more intensely.  

The thing is, I’m not sure if scratching alone is enough to call it deception. It feels more like a random, harmless gesture. If I had to guess, I’d lean toward them being truthful because the rest of their behavior is so neutral—no signs of the classic "lying" body language we hear about. But I’d also be hesitant to say for sure, since everyone’s different. Maybe they’re just really itchy, or maybe they’re trying not to show they’re nervous, which ironically makes them scratch more. It’s one of those things where it’s easy to overthink it. Honestly, I’d need more context—like what they’re saying or the situation—to feel confident either way. For now, I’d say it’s probably not deception, but I wouldn’t bet on it.

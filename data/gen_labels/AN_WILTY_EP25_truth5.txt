From what I can see in the clip, the person is maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're speaking to—no shifting eyes, no looking away, and definitely no fidgeting or nervous habits like touching their face or crossing their arms. They're just sitting there, calm and focused, answering whatever's being asked. That kind of direct gaze without any of the usual "tells" (like excessive blinking or lip-biting) often makes me lean toward them being truthful. When people lie, they usually fidget or avoid eye contact, so the fact that they're not doing that feels... natural. Like they're just being honest and not trying to hide anything.  

But then again, I know some people can fake that calmness. If someone's practiced at lying or really wants to seem credible, they might consciously keep their eyes locked on the person and avoid moving. I’ve seen that before—like in interviews where someone’s trying too hard to look confident. So it’s not impossible. The lack of nervous energy could also just mean they’re comfortable in the situation, not necessarily truthful. Maybe they’re just not nervous about the topic at all.  

Honestly, though, the more I watch, the more it feels like they’re just being straightforward. No awkward pauses, no forced smiles, nothing that seems rehearsed or off. It’s the absence of the *usual* signs of deception that stands out to me—not that they’re doing anything "perfect" to seem truthful, just not doing anything that’d make me doubt them. I’m not 100% sure, but based on what I’m seeing, I’d guess they’re telling the truth. It’s not a slam-dunk, but it’s the most likely explanation I can see right now.

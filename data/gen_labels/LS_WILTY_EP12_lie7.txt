Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person's behavior feels a bit off, but I keep second-guessing myself because it's easy to misread nervousness as lying. They're definitely blinking a lot—like, way more than usual—and their eyebrows are raised a lot, which makes me think they're trying to seem engaged or maybe even a bit anxious. There's that little lip protrusion too, like they're holding something back, and their chin keeps dipping down like they're thinking hard or trying not to say something. They nod a lot, which usually feels like agreement, but it could also be a nervous tic. And their gaze? They look at the person talking to them sometimes, but mostly they're looking down or glancing sideways, which I've heard is a common sign of deception—like avoiding eye contact. But wait, I've also seen people look down when they're just shy or uncomfortable, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just really stressed about the situation, like they're being interviewed about something awkward.  

On the flip side, the nodding and the fact they're actually making eye contact sometimes (even if it's brief) feels like they're trying to seem honest. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or more obvious avoidance, but they're pretty still otherwise—no hands rubbing or covering their face, which I'd expect if they were hiding something. The head side-turn feels natural, like they're just shifting their weight, not like a deliberate signal. And the frequent blinking? Could be anything—maybe the lighting's bothering them, or they're just tired. I remember reading that nervous habits like that don't always mean deception; sometimes they just mean someone's in a high-pressure moment.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The cues lean toward deception—raised brows, gaze shifts, lip stuff—but they're not screaming "liar" to me. It could totally be them just being really nervous about the topic, not actually lying. Like, if I were asked something embarrassing on camera, I'd probably do all those things too. I wouldn't call it a definite "lie," but I'd be skeptical. Maybe it's deception, maybe it's just a really awkward moment. I'd need more context to feel confident. Right now, I'd say it's *possible* they're not being truthful, but I'm not sure enough to say for sure.

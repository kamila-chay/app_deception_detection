Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning a bit toward them not being entirely truthful. The way they keep looking down while still making eye contact with the person they're talking to feels a little off—like they're avoiding direct eye contact but trying to seem engaged at the same time. That downward gaze, combined with the head tilting and side-turning, makes me think they're processing something carefully, maybe even rehearsing their words. It’s not the classic "avoiding eyes" thing, but the combination feels a bit forced, like they're consciously adjusting their posture to seem calm while they're actually nervous.  

But here’s where it gets tricky—I could totally be misreading it. Head tilting and side-turning are super common when people are listening or thinking, not necessarily lying. And they’ve got their arms open *and* folded at the same time? That’s weird. It looks like they might have started with arms open to seem friendly but then crossed them defensively mid-sentence. That could just be them shifting around in their seat, not deception. Also, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, and they’re not smiling or laughing like someone might if they were hiding something. Maybe they’re just naturally a bit stiff when they talk, or maybe they’re genuinely focused on what they’re saying.  

I guess the thing that sticks with me is how their gaze *stays* on the other person but keeps dipping down—like they’re trying to look attentive while their eyes betray them. But I’ve seen people do that when they’re just shy or thoughtful, not lying. Honestly, it’s hard to tell. If I had to guess, I’d say *maybe* deception, but I’d want to see more of the context or hear the actual words before I’d feel confident. It’s the kind of thing where a second opinion would help, because body language alone is so messy.

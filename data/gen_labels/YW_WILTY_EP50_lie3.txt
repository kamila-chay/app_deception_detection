Hmm, this is a bit of a head-scratcher. I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Let me walk through what I'm seeing. They're definitely looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like it could be a sign of honesty—people often avoid eye contact when lying, right? But then there's that sideways glance too, which sometimes happens when someone's thinking or trying to recall something, not necessarily lying. And they're smiling, which is interesting. It's not a big, fake laugh, just a regular smile, and they're not frowning or looking tense at all. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" signs like fidgeting with their hands, blinking a lot, or avoiding eye contact completely. 

On the flip side, though, I know some people who are really good at lying—they might *not* show those obvious tells. Maybe that smile is actually a little forced, like they're trying too hard to seem calm. Sometimes when people are lying, they'll smile to seem friendly or to cover up their discomfort, even if they're not laughing. And the sideways glance could just be a natural habit, not a sign of deception. I'm also thinking, why would they smile if they're lying? It feels a bit counterintuitive. Most of the time, when I've seen people lie in real life, they seem more stiff or closed off, not smiling. 

But here's the thing: the absence of nervous behavior *does* make me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying and trying to hide it, I'd expect them to be more tense—maybe shifting in their seat, touching their face, or looking away more often. They're not doing any of that. Their gaze is mostly on the other person, which feels engaged, not evasive. So maybe they're just being honest, and the smile is genuine. But I can't rule out that they're a really practiced liar who doesn't show signs. It's hard to say for sure. 

Honestly, I'm not 100% confident either way. It seems *more likely* they're telling the truth because they're relaxed, making eye contact, and smiling without seeming off. But I'm not going to say "definitely truthful" because deception can be subtle. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's probably truthfulness, but I'd want to hear more context or see them in a different situation to be sure. It's the lack of red flags that's throwing me off—usually, when people lie, there's *something* that feels "off," but here it just feels... normal.

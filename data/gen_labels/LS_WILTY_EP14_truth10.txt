Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's a bit tricky to call outright, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I'd want to watch it again to be sure. They're looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me, not like someone dodging eye contact to hide something. And they're not doing any of those obvious nervous things—no frantic blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no fake smiles or laughing. The way their lips are just slightly pushed out, like they're thinking hard about what they're saying, actually seems pretty natural for someone just trying to recall or explain something clearly.  

But here's where I hesitate: they keep glancing down occasionally while they talk, and sometimes their head turns sideways a bit. I know some people say looking down can be a sign of lying, like they're avoiding scrutiny, but honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating or being respectful, especially in casual conversations. It might not mean anything at all—it could just be how they process thoughts. And the head turning sideways? That's super common when people are speaking, not necessarily deceptive.  

The thing that makes me more confident they're truthful is how calm they seem overall. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension—like their jaw tightening or shifting in their seat—but they're just sitting there, steady. No crossed arms or defensive gestures either. The absence of those classic "lie signs" feels more telling than the few neutral things they're doing. But yeah, I'm not 100% certain—people can be really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just used to being in front of a camera. Still, based on what I see, it seems like they're just telling the story they remember, not making it up. I'd say truth, but I'd want to hear the context too before I'd stake my whole opinion on it.

Hmm, looking at the clip, I'm not 100% sure, but here's what stands out to me. They're not smiling or frowning, which is interesting because when people lie, they sometimes force a smile or look tense. Instead, they seem pretty neutral but engaged—like they're actually listening to the question. Their eyes are locked on the person asking, and they've got palms up, which usually feels open and honest to me, like they're not hiding anything. They also don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which are common signs people associate with lying.  

But then again, I've heard that some people who lie *do* keep their palms up and maintain eye contact to seem trustworthy, so that could be a red herring. The eyebrows raised a bit too—could be surprise at the question, or maybe just natural expression. I'm not sure if that's a sign of truth or just nervousness. Honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to say. Like, if they're recalling something real, the lack of stress cues (no blinking, no awkward pauses) leans toward truth, but if they're rehearsed or used to being on camera, those "truth" cues might be faked too. I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because the behavior feels... calm? But I'm not confident—it's super easy to misread these things. Maybe it's just me, but it doesn't *feel* like they're hiding something.

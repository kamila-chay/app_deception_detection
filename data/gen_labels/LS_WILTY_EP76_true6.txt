Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's not super obvious at first glance. The person seems to be maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to most of the time—that "Gaze towards interlocutor: True" stands out. When people are lying, they often avoid eye contact or glance away a lot, so this feels a bit natural for someone being honest. But then there's that "Gaze down: True" too, which makes me pause for a second. Sometimes people look down when they're thinking or being modest, but it can also happen when lying, especially if they're trying to avoid scrutiny. 

What really sticks out to me is how calm they seem otherwise. There's no fidgeting—no hands rubbing, no exaggerated blinking, no tense facial expressions like frowning or lip-pulling. The description says "Lip corners down" is false, so they're not scowling or looking upset, which you'd expect if they were stressed about lying. And they're not making those "I'm lying" tells like avoiding eye contact entirely or nodding too much. Actually, the lack of nervous energy feels more consistent with someone who's just speaking truthfully and comfortably. 

But I should consider the counter: maybe they're a really good liar who's practiced staying calm, or maybe they're just naturally quiet. Some people look down while thinking, even when telling the truth—like when they're recalling something detailed. And while eye contact is often a truth indicator, it's not foolproof. A skilled liar might lock eyes to seem convincing. Still, the fact that they're not *avoiding* eye contact at all, combined with no other stress cues, makes me lean toward truth. It feels like the kind of behavior you'd see from someone who's just answering straightforwardly, not someone who's crafting a story. 

I can't say for sure, though—there's always room for doubt. But based on what I'm seeing, the calmness and steady eye contact, even with the occasional downward glance, seem more aligned with honesty than deception. It's not screaming "truth," but it's not screaming "lie" either, and the absence of red flags feels more telling than the presence of any single sign. So yeah, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth, but I'd still want to hear the full context to be certain.

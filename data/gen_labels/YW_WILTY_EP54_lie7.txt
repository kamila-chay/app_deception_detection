Hmm, this is tricky. From what I can see in the clip, the person seems a bit tense, but I'm not sure if it's because they're lying or just nervous in general. They're not smiling or laughing at all, which feels off for the situation—like they're holding back, but that could just be their natural demeanor. The thing that stands out most is how often they're shaking their head, like a definite "no" motion, and they keep touching their head or neck with their hand. I've heard people say head shaking and touching the face can be signs of deception, like they're trying to dismiss something or feeling uneasy.

But honestly, I'm not totally convinced. I've seen people shake their head a lot when they're just disagreeing or frustrated, even if they're being honest—maybe they're annoyed with the question or the situation itself. And that hand touching? Could be a nervous habit, like they have a headache or just fidget when they're thinking hard. I mean, I've done that myself when I'm trying to remember something, and I wasn't lying. Also, they're not avoiding eye contact or blinking a lot, which some people expect liars to do, so that's a bit confusing. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs like a forced smile or looking away a lot, but they're just... stiff, maybe? Like they're trying too hard to seem calm.

I guess I'm leaning toward maybe they're not being truthful, but it's really hard to tell without knowing what they're being asked about. Like, if someone asked them a question they genuinely didn't know the answer to, they might shake their head and fidget without lying. Or maybe they're just really uncomfortable in front of the camera. I'd probably need to hear the actual question and their response to feel more sure. Right now, it's a bit ambiguous—I'd say it's possible they're lying, but it's not a slam dunk. I'd want to see more of the interaction before I'd feel confident either way.

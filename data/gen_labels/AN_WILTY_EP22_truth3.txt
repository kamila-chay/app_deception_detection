Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They're keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to be sincere, and they're nodding along like they're following the conversation. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" tells—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiles. That absence of stress cues actually makes me lean toward them being truthful, because when people lie, they often get physically restless or show micro-expressions they can't control. But... I'm not 100% sure, because I've heard that some practiced liars actually *do* maintain eye contact and nod to seem more convincing. Like, maybe they've rehearsed this or are really good at hiding it. Also, the way they're nodding could just be a habit, not necessarily agreement—they might be nodding because they're listening politely, not because they're being honest. And honestly, without knowing the context—like, is this a high-pressure situation where they'd be more likely to lie?—it's hard to say for sure. If it's a casual chat, the calmness feels natural. But if it's something serious, that same calmness might feel *too* controlled. I'd say the behavior *suggests* truthfulness more than lying, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's just... the lack of obvious tension makes it feel more like they're just being themselves, not putting on a show. Still, it's a tough call—people are complicated.

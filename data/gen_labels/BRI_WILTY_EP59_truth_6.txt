Hmm, looking at this video clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "lie" or "truth" at me. Let me walk through what I'm seeing. 

First off, they're actually making pretty consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so they're not avoiding looking at the person, which is interesting because a lot of people assume liars won't meet your eyes. But they do have these frowning eyebrows and raised eyebrows going on at the same time, which feels a bit contradictory. Like, they're not smiling or laughing (which would be a relief if they were stressed), but they're not scowling either. It just looks... tense, maybe? Like they're really concentrating on what they're saying. 

Then there's the sideways glance—gaze sideways is true—but it's not constant. They're mostly looking at the person, just occasionally shifting their eyes sideways, which could just be natural movement, not a sign of deception. I've seen people do that when they're thinking or recalling something, even when they're being honest. The lack of other tells stands out too: no frequent blinking, no lip biting, no hands fidgeting, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed. Those are the classic "liar" cues people often point to, and they're all absent here. 

But wait—could they be a really good liar who's avoiding those obvious signs? Maybe. Skilled liars sometimes *do* maintain eye contact to seem credible, and the frowning could just be them trying to look serious or thoughtful to sell the story. The raised eyebrows might even be a nervous tic they're not controlling. I mean, I've definitely had moments where I've frowned while explaining something complicated, and it wasn't because I was hiding something. 

Still, the fact that they're not showing *any* of the other physical signs makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those other cues—like scratching their neck or avoiding eye contact entirely. The sideways glances feel more like someone who's just... human, maybe a little anxious but not deceptive. Like, they're not *acting*; they're just speaking with some natural tension. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying. But based *only* on the body language here, the absence of the usual "lie" signals seems to outweigh the frowning and raised eyebrows. It doesn't feel like deception to me, but I'm not 100% certain. It could just be them being naturally expressive while being honest. I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there are always exceptions.

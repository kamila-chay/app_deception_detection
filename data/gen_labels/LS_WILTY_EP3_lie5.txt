Okay, so I watched this clip, and honestly? I'm not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what stood out to me. The person seems pretty tense. Their eyebrows are kind of pulled down in a frown *and* raised up at the same time—like they're caught between being annoyed and confused. That’s weird, right? Usually, people don’t do both at once unless they’re really struggling with something. And their mouth is just... closed tight, like they’re holding back words, especially during those little pauses where they don’t say anything for a second too long. It feels awkward, like they’re searching for the right thing to say instead of just talking naturally.

Then there’s the way they’re looking. They keep glancing at the person they’re talking to (so gaze toward interlocutor is on), but their eyes are mostly down, like they’re avoiding direct eye contact. And they’re turning their head sideways a few times—like, not just a little nod, but a full side-turn. That feels like someone who’s uncomfortable or trying to distance themselves mentally. I’ve seen people do that when they’re nervous, but it’s also common if you’re just thinking hard.  

But here’s where I’m hesitating: maybe they’re not lying. Could be they’re just stressed about the situation—maybe it’s a tough topic, or they’re not used to being on camera. Gaze down isn’t always a lie; some people look down when they’re concentrating or being polite. And the head side-turn? Could just be a habit, or maybe they’re listening carefully and shifting their body to focus. The mouth being closed during pauses might just mean they’re being careful with their words, not necessarily hiding something.  

On the other hand, the mix of frowning and raised eyebrows *does* feel like internal conflict—like they’re trying to seem calm but aren’t. And the awkward pauses with the mouth shut? That’s the part that sticks with me. If they were just nervous, they might fidget or say "um," but this feels more like they’re *choosing* not to say something. I’d lean toward deception, but I’m really not certain. It’s easy to misread body language, especially without knowing the context. Maybe they’re just bad at interviews, or maybe they’re lying. I’d say it’s probably deception, but I’d want to see more of the conversation or hear the actual words before I’d be confident. It’s not a slam dunk, but the signs point that way for me.

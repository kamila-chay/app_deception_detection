Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn on whether they're being truthful or not. They're maintaining steady eye contact with the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels a bit unusual for someone who might be lying—most people I've noticed tend to look away or glance down when they're not being honest. But here, they're actually looking *at* the person while also occasionally glancing down (like maybe at their hands or the floor), and they're nodding along as if they're engaged. That consistent eye contact and nodding make me lean toward them being truthful at first glance.  

But then I start thinking—some people who are lying *practice* looking directly at someone to seem more credible, especially if they've been told that "liars don't make eye contact." So maybe they're doing that deliberately. And while they're not fidgeting or touching their face (which often happens when people are nervous), the fact that they're *not* showing any of those classic "nervous" cues could also mean they're calm because they're lying, not because they're telling the truth. Like, if they're rehearsed or confident in their lie, they might not show physical signs of stress.  

Also, their speech seems smooth—no awkward pauses or hesitation, which sometimes happens when people are fabricating stories. But again, that could just mean they've thought this through ahead of time. Honestly, I'm not sure. The video doesn't give me any clear red flags like a forced smile or avoiding eye contact, which would make me more certain they're lying. But it also doesn't have the "obvious truthfulness" signs either, like relaxed gestures or natural laughter.  

I guess I'd say it's ambiguous. It *feels* like they're being genuine because of the eye contact and nodding, but I can't rule out that they're just very practiced at hiding it. If I had to guess without any other context, I might lean toward "truthful," but I'd be hesitant to say for sure. There are too many ways this could go either way.

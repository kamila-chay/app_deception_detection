Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The person seems pretty calm while speaking—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or those little "tells" people often associate with lying, like excessive blinking or fidgeting with their hands. They're keeping their palms up, which feels open and non-defensive, and their face is pretty neutral—not scowling or smiling, but not tense either. It’s not like they're hiding anything behind their hands or avoiding looking at the camera.  

That said, I know it's tricky because sometimes people who are lying *do* try to seem calm and controlled, so the lack of obvious stress could actually be a sign they're rehearsing or suppressing emotions. Like, if they were lying, they might be working extra hard to not show any signs, so their calmness might be suspicious. But then again, I've seen a lot of people who are just naturally low-key or reserved—they don't get overly expressive when they're being honest. The way they're speaking seems steady, and there's no hesitation or awkward pauses that I'd expect if they were making things up.  

The thing that really makes me lean toward truth is that they're not *doing* anything to seem convincing. If they were lying, I'd maybe expect them to overdo the eye contact or add a little too much emphasis, but they're just... talking. Simple. Like they're not trying to sell anything. But yeah, I'm not 100% certain—people can be really good at faking calmness, and maybe they're just really good at hiding it. Still, based on what I see, it feels more like someone who's just being straightforward than someone who's trying to cover up something. It's not a huge red flag for lying, at least.

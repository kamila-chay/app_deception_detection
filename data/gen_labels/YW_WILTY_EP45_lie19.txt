Honestly, while some of their body language suggests openness—like the arms open and palms up and steady eye contact—their constant hand scratching and head touching catch my attention. These nervous fidgeting behaviors often appear when someone is uncomfortable or stressed, which can be a sign of deception. The mixed facial expressions, with raised eyebrows combined with an uneven smile and frown, add to the uncertainty and feel less like genuine confusion and more like an attempt to mask true feelings. The shrug at the end might indicate uncertainty, but it could also be a way to deflect or avoid giving a direct answer. Although the open posture and direct gaze generally signal honesty, these can sometimes be consciously used to appear trustworthy. Considering all these subtle contradictions, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that the person may not be entirely truthful, even if it’s not a certainty. The signals suggest some level of discomfort that could be linked to deception, though more context would be needed to be reasonably sure.

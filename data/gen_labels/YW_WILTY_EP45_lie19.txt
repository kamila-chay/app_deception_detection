Honestly, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—I'm trying to read this as objectively as I can. The way they're sitting with their arms open and palms up feels like they're trying to seem open and honest, which usually leans toward truth-telling, right? And they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which also feels like they're being straightforward. But then there's that constant hand scratching and touching their head—like they're fidgeting a lot. I've noticed that when people are stressed or nervous, they do things like that, and lying can make people nervous, so that's a red flag for me.  

But here's where I'm stuck: the raised eyebrows and that weird mix of lip corners up (like a smile) and down (like a frown) at the same time? That's confusing. If they were just confused or surprised, maybe that makes sense—like they're processing something unexpected. And the shrug at the end feels like they're saying, "I don't know," which could mean they're genuinely unsure, not hiding something. Plus, the open posture and direct gaze are strong indicators of truthfulness in my experience, so I keep doubting the nervousness. Maybe they're just a nervous person in general, or maybe they're actually answering honestly but feel awkward about the question.  

I guess it's a toss-up. The fidgeting and mixed expressions make me lean a little toward deception, but the open body language and eye contact feel too strong to ignore. Like, if they were lying, why would they keep their arms open and palms up? Some liars do that to seem trustworthy, but it's not the first thing I'd expect. Honestly, I'd probably say "truthful" if I had to guess, but I'm not confident at all. There's just too much mixed signaling—like they're either really stressed about something they're saying, or they're just a very expressive person who doesn't realize they're fidgeting. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation to be sure.

Watching this clip, I'm leaning towards the idea that the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. They maintain eye contact throughout, which traditionally suggests honesty, but since some liars deliberately sustain eye contact to appear trustworthy, that alone isn’t definitive. Their repeated eyebrow raises could indicate surprise or confusion, but might also be a way to mask discomfort or uncertainty. More notably, the way they lean back slightly and cover their mouth several times stands out. These gestures often signal nervousness or an attempt to hide something, which can be associated with deception. However, it’s also possible that these behaviors come from general nervousness or habit rather than dishonesty. Considering all this, while I’m inclined to suspect they may not be fully truthful, I wouldn’t say it’s certain—it feels like a subtle hint of deception rather than a clear sign. More context would definitely help clarify the situation.

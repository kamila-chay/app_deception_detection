Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward this person being truthful, but I won't say it's definite—there's always room for doubt with body language. They're smiling a lot, which feels genuine to me because it's not forced; their lip corners are up naturally, and they're not doing anything like covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands. They keep eye contact with whoever they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor), which usually means they're engaged, not hiding something. Plus, their arms are open, and they're nodding along—those are classic signs of openness and agreement, not someone trying to hide the truth. The way they glance down occasionally seems like they're just thinking, not avoiding eye contact to lie.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. People sometimes smile when they're nervous or trying to seem friendly, even when they're lying. And the downward gaze—while it could just be them concentrating—sometimes gets misread as a sign of deception. But in this case, they're not blinking a lot, their eyebrows aren't raised in surprise, and there's no awkward silence. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like touching their face or looking away more often. Here, everything feels calm and consistent. Honestly, the more I watch, the less it seems like deception—more like someone who's comfortable and honest. But I'm not 100% sure; you can't always tell just from a clip. It just *feels* like they're telling the truth based on how they're moving and interacting.

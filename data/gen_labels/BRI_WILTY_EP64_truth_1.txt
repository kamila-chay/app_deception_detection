Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there's not a ton of obvious body language going on. They're not smiling, not frowning, not avoiding eye contact (wait, actually, the video shows they're not looking at the person they're talking to—gaze is down or sideways, not toward the interlocutor—but I'm not sure if that's a big deal here). The only thing that stands out is they're sticking their lips out a little bit, like they're making a small pout or just holding their mouth in a neutral-but-slightly-pressed way. 

Now, I know some people think lip protrusion can be a sign of lying—like when someone's trying to hold back a comment or being stubborn—but honestly, I've seen that happen all the time when people are just thinking hard or annoyed, not necessarily lying. Like, if you're trying to remember something or you're frustrated with a question, you might do that without even realizing it. And there's nothing else that screams "deception" here: no nervous blinking, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to talk, no fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact in a way that feels forced. They're just... sitting there, maybe a little tense, but not the kind of tense that usually comes with lying. 

That said, I can see why someone might worry. If they're not looking at the person they're talking to, that *could* be a sign of dishonesty in some contexts, but I've also seen people not make eye contact because they're concentrating or just not used to it, especially if they're in a casual setting. And since there's no other nervous energy—no raised eyebrows, no head shaking, nothing—they seem pretty calm overall. 

I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because the behavior just doesn't match the classic "lie signs" I've heard about. It feels more like they're just being thoughtful or maybe a bit reluctant to answer, not like they're actively hiding something. But I'm not 100% sure—people can lie without any of these obvious tells, and without hearing what they're saying or knowing the situation, it's hard to be definitive. If I had to guess based on the video alone, I'd say it's more likely they're being truthful, but I'd want to hear the actual conversation to feel better about it. It's not screaming "lie," but it's not screaming "truth" either—just... quiet, neutral, and a little stubborn with those lips.

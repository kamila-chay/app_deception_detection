Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out myself. I watched the clip a couple times, and the person just seems... really calm. Like, they're sitting there with their hands still, eyes mostly steady on the person they're talking to, no fidgeting, no shifting in their seat, and they're not even blinking much more than usual. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect to see *something*—like maybe looking away, or fidgeting with their hands, or that little hesitation where people pause awkwardly. But here, they're just speaking normally, like they're just telling a story they actually remember. It feels like the opposite of the "nervous liar" stereotype.

But then I keep thinking, "Wait, maybe they're just really good at lying." I've heard some people can stay completely still and even make eye contact while lying—they practice it. So the fact that they're not showing any of those classic signs might not mean they're telling the truth; it might just mean they're hiding it really well. Like, if they were making it up, they'd probably be extra careful to seem relaxed, right? So that calmness could actually be a red flag for deception, not a sign of honesty. It's tricky because we usually assume liars are jumpy, but not everyone is. Some people are just naturally composed, and maybe they're just a calm person, not a good liar.

I guess what sticks with me is how *even* they sound. No sudden changes in tone, no pauses where they seem to be searching for words—they're just... flowing. Like they're answering a question they've thought about before. If they were lying, I'd expect a little more effort in the delivery, but it just feels effortless. Still, I can't rule out that they're faking that effortlessness. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're talking about. But based on what I see, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, just because the lack of tension feels genuine, not forced. Though I'd still want to hear more before I'd be totally sure.

Honestly, while it’s hard to be completely sure, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might not be telling the whole truth. Their eyes are blinking a lot more than usual, and they keep sticking their lower lip out like they’re holding something back. That lip movement, combined with raised eyebrows and the subtle head shaking, feels a bit off—definitely not the calm, steady eye contact you’d expect from someone being straightforward. The way they touch their head a few times seems like a self-soothing gesture, which often shows stress about what they’re saying.

That said, some things don’t quite fit a clear picture of deception. Their open arms and the fact they maintain direct eye contact could be attempts to appear honest. The head shaking might just be a natural way of expressing denial rather than a sign of lying. It's possible they’re nervous about being recorded or genuinely upset about the topic, which can explain some of their behaviors without implying deceit.

Still, balancing these cues makes me lean more toward the possibility they’re not fully truthful, even if I can’t say that with certainty. The nervous habits, paired with their other subtle signals, suggest they might be hiding something. I’d prefer to see more or hear their exact words to feel more confident, but based on this alone, I tend to think there’s more going on than just stress or discomfort.

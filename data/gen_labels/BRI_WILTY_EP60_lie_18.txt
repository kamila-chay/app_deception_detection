Watching the clip, I'm actually a bit torn on this one. The person is definitely making eye contact with the camera the whole time—like, they're consistently looking right at the interviewer or whoever they're speaking to, which feels a bit intentional. But then they keep glancing down, almost like they're checking their notes or just avoiding direct focus for a second. I've seen that before with people who are being really careful about what they say, but honestly, I've also seen it with people who are just naturally a bit fidgety or thoughtful, not necessarily lying.  

On one hand, the downward gaze *could* be a sign of discomfort or evasion—some studies suggest people look down when they're fabricating stories, especially if they're trying to control their expression. And since they're not doing any of the usual "tells" like fake smiling, fidgeting, or avoiding eye contact entirely, the fact that they're *mostly* looking at the camera but slipping down might feel like a subtle attempt to seem honest while actually being nervous. That’s the deception angle.  

But here’s where I hesitate: they’re not doing anything else that screams "liar." No awkward pauses, no excessive blinking, no lip movements or nervous gestures. If they were lying, I’d expect at least one of those. Maybe they’re just really focused on what they’re saying, or maybe they’re from a culture where looking down while speaking is normal, not a red flag. I’ve even heard that some people look down when they’re telling the truth because they’re processing information, not hiding it.  

Honestly, without more context—like what they’re saying or if there’s a known fact they’re denying—I can’t lean too hard either way. The eye contact seems deliberate, but the downward glances might just be their natural speaking rhythm. I’d probably say "maybe" on deception, but I’d be really cautious about calling it a sure thing. It’s the kind of thing where if I heard the actual words, I’d feel more confident, but just from the body language? I’m still on the fence.

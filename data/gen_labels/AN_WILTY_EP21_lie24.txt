Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while talking. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're speaking to—like they're really listening—and they're nodding along as they talk, which often feels like a sign of engagement or agreement. Their arms are open, not crossed or folded, which usually gives off a "I'm not hiding anything" vibe. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, and there's no obvious sign of nervousness like quick blinking or touching their face. To me, that combination—eye contact, nodding, open posture—usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, especially since they're not doing any of those classic "lie signs" we hear about, like avoiding gaze or covering their mouth.

But honestly, it's not totally clear-cut. I've heard that some people who are lying actually *practice* looking calm and attentive to seem honest—they might rehearse nodding or keep their arms open to avoid suspicion. Maybe they're just really good at controlling their body language, or maybe they're used to being in situations where they need to seem trustworthy. The fact that they're not showing any of those "nervous" cues could also mean they're not stressed about lying, which would actually point toward deception. I mean, if they were genuinely upset about something, they might fidget or look away, but here it's the opposite—everything's smooth. It's a bit tricky because the absence of "lie signs" doesn't always mean truth; sometimes it means the person's just really practiced at it.

I guess what's throwing me off is that they're not doing anything *unusual*—no exaggerated gestures, no odd pauses, nothing that stands out as "off." That makes me think they might be telling the truth, but it's also possible they're just so used to this that they don't show any tells. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Like, it feels like they're being straightforward, but you can't always tell just from body language alone. It's one of those cases where you'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to piece together if this person seems genuine. What stands out first is how they're holding their posture—they've got their arms fully open, which usually feels like an unconsciously relaxed or welcoming gesture, not something someone would do if they were trying to hide something. Then there's the eye contact: they're consistently looking right at the person they're talking to, not glancing away or down like I've seen in some "telling a lie" moments. And yeah, they're raising their eyebrows a few times—like when they're processing something or reacting to a question—but it doesn't feel forced or exaggerated, just natural. That makes me lean toward them being honest, especially since their body language isn't screaming "nervous" or "on guard."  

But I can see why someone might second-guess it. Raising eyebrows *can* sometimes happen when people are lying—like if they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical to cover up a story. And yeah, I know some folks keep steady eye contact when lying because they're trying too hard to seem sincere, so that part alone isn't foolproof. Also, the arms open thing... I've seen people do that even when they're stressed, just out of habit. Like, maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, not necessarily trying to prove they're telling the truth.  

Still, the combo of open arms, direct gaze, and no other "tells" like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact feels more aligned with someone being at ease. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension—like tightening their jaw or shifting around, but they're just standing there relaxed. It's not 100% conclusive, obviously, but based on what I'm seeing, it seems like they're probably telling the truth. I mean, I'm not saying I'd bet money on it, but the cues here are pretty consistent with someone being open and honest. Maybe it's just their normal way of talking, but it doesn't read as "fake" to me.

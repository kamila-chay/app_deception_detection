Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, though it's a bit tricky. The main thing that stands out is how they're looking down while still facing the person they're talking to—like, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely, but their gaze is directed downward, maybe at their lap or the floor. I've heard that people sometimes look down when they're being deceptive, like they're trying to hide something, but I've also seen that truth-tellers do it when they're thinking or feeling uncomfortable, especially if they're just a quiet or shy person. The thing is, there aren't any other classic "lie" signs here: no nervous blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no fake smiles, no awkward pauses where they're just staring at the floor with their mouth shut. They seem pretty calm and composed overall.  

That said, I can see why someone might think they're lying. If they're deliberately avoiding direct eye contact by looking down, it *could* be a sign they're not being honest—like they're uncomfortable with what they're saying. But honestly, the lack of other physical cues makes me doubt that. If they were really lying, I'd expect to see more signs of stress, like twitching or forced smiles, but they don't seem tense at all. Maybe they're just a naturally reserved person who tends to look down when they're speaking, and it's not about deception at all.  

I guess the real question is whether looking down in this context is a red flag or just their normal way of talking. Without more context—like what they're saying or the situation—I can't be sure. It feels like it might be a case of overthinking the gaze, especially since they're still making some eye contact (the "gaze towards interlocutor" is marked as true). So yeah, I'm not convinced they're lying, but I'm not ruling it out completely either. It's one of those moments where the behavior is ambiguous, and you'd really need to hear the words to be certain.

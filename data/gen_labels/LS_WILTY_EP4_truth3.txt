From what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They're smiling naturally (lip corners up), making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, and nodding along like they're really listening or agreeing. Their head is tilted slightly, which often feels like a sign of openness or interest, not tension. I don't see any of the classic "nervous" cues—no frowning, no rapid blinking, no hands fidgeting or covering their face. They're just sitting there, relaxed, and responding with those small, genuine nods. It feels like they're comfortable with what they're saying, which usually lines up with someone being truthful.  

That said, I'm not 100% certain. Sometimes people who are lying can *also* look calm if they're practiced or in a high-stakes situation—like if they're rehearsed or just really good at hiding it. But the way they're smiling and maintaining eye contact feels more like natural engagement than a forced performance. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe a bit more stiffness or those subtle avoidance cues (like glancing away or touching their face), but there's none of that here. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because absence of nervousness isn't *proof* of truth—it's just consistent with it. But between the two, the behavior leans way more toward them being genuine. I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'd still want to hear the full context to be sure.

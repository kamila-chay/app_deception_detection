Honestly, based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that feels like it could be an attempt to seem trustworthy, which actually makes me wonder if they're trying *too* hard. But then their arms are folded the whole time, which often signals defensiveness or discomfort, and that's a bit of a red flag. I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I know that's not always true—some people use intense eye contact to seem convincing, so that alone isn't definitive.  

On the flip side, they don't seem nervous in other ways: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or laughing. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tells," like touching their face or avoiding gaze, but they're not doing any of that. Maybe they're just naturally reserved or comfortable with the situation, and the folded arms are just their usual posture. I've seen people fold their arms when they're listening carefully or just feeling a bit closed off, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

The thing that sticks with me is the lack of *other* cues. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those other signs—like a slight hesitation or a nervous gesture—but there's nothing. So it's possible they're just being straightforward, and the folded arms are a total red herring. But then again, some people who lie *do* manage to stay calm and make eye contact while folding their arms, so I can't rule it out either.  

Honestly, I'd lean toward them being truthful just because the behavior doesn't match the usual deception patterns I've seen, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to second-guess—like, maybe they're just good at hiding it, or maybe I'm overthinking the folded arms. Without more context, it's really hard to say for sure. My gut says they're probably not lying, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to be certain.

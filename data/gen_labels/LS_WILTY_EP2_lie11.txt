Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's tricky because body language alone isn't a perfect lie detector, but I'll share what stands out. The person seems pretty tense—like, their eyebrows are pulled down in a frown, and their lips are kind of pulled down too, not smiling at all. They're blinking a lot, which I've heard can signal stress or trying to think, but it could also just mean they're tired or the lighting's bothering them. Their chin keeps lifting up a bit, like they're tilting it slightly upward, and their head moves back a little when they're speaking, which feels a bit defensive. They're also nodding while they talk, and their eyes stay fixed on the person asking the question, which is interesting because I've heard some people say liars avoid eye contact, but they're actually looking right at them. 

On the flip side, though, I wonder if they're just uncomfortable with the question—not necessarily lying. Maybe they're nervous about the topic, or they're genuinely frustrated with how it's being asked. The frequent blinking and frown could just be them processing something they find annoying or confusing, not deception. And that chin movement? Could be a natural habit, like they do that when they're concentrating, not because they're hiding something. I've seen people act like this when they're just being honest but stressed, like when they're trying to give a clear answer but feel pressured. 

But... the way they're avoiding any kind of smile or relaxed expression, combined with that tightness around the mouth and the constant blinking, makes me lean toward them not being fully open. It doesn't feel like they're comfortable in the moment. I'm not 100% sure though—maybe they're just having a bad day. But if I had to guess based on what I see, it feels like they're holding back something, so I'd say deception is possible. Still, I'd want to hear more context before I'd be confident about it. Like, what were they being asked about? Sometimes the situation changes everything.

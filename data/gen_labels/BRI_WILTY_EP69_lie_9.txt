Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'd lean toward them not being deceptive—though I can see why someone might think they are. The person raises their eyebrows a couple of times when answering, which sometimes happens when people are processing a question or feeling a bit thrown off, but it’s not a guaranteed sign of lying. They also keep looking sideways a lot instead of directly at the person asking, which *can* be a red flag for deception in some contexts. But honestly, I’ve seen people do that just because they’re shy, distracted, or even just naturally not great at maintaining eye contact—like maybe they’re thinking hard about the answer or just uncomfortable in the setting.

What makes me hesitate is that they don’t have any of the stronger "lie tells" I’ve heard about, like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact completely, or looking down a lot. Their head actually moves backward a bit when they talk, which I’ve read can sometimes signal discomfort, but it could also just be a relaxed posture shift—like they’re leaning back to get comfortable. And they’re not smiling or laughing, which feels a bit odd for a true story, but it’s not unusual for someone to be serious or hesitant. If they were lying, I’d expect more nervous energy—like more blinking or shifting around—but they seem pretty still otherwise. 

That said, I’m not ruling it out entirely. Maybe they’re just really bad at hiding their stress, or maybe the question was genuinely surprising, making them raise their eyebrows and look away. I’ve also seen cases where people *do* look sideways when lying, so it’s possible. But all things considered, the lack of other classic signs makes me think they might be telling the truth, or at least not actively deceiving. It’s hard to say for sure without more context, but my gut says it’s probably not deception—just someone being a bit awkward or thoughtful. Still, I’d want to hear more of the conversation to feel confident.

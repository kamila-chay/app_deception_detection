Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing. In the clip, the person is looking straight at the camera the whole time—like they're making deliberate eye contact—while answering. That's one thing that makes me lean toward them being truthful, because people often avoid eye contact when they're lying. But then they're shaking their head "no" pretty consistently while they talk, which feels a bit odd if they're just stating facts. Like, if they were being honest, why keep denying something? And their eyebrows are raised a lot—almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, which doesn't quite match the calmness of the rest of their posture.  

On the flip side, though, their hands are open with palms up, which usually signals honesty or openness—like they're trying to seem transparent. That's the opposite of what I'd expect if they were lying. And they're not fidgeting, laughing, or smiling unnaturally, which are common signs of deception. Maybe they're just nervous about the question, not lying. I've seen people shake their heads like that when they're confused or trying to clarify, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

The head shaking is really throwing me off—it feels like a key clue, but it's hard to pin down. If they were lying, why not just say "no" without the extra head movement? But if they're telling the truth, why would they keep shaking their head like they're disagreeing with themselves? Honestly, I'm stuck between two interpretations. The open palms and direct eye contact make me think truth, but the head shaking and raised eyebrows make me wonder. I'd probably say it's more likely they're being truthful, but I'm not confident at all—this feels like one of those moments where the behavior could go either way depending on context. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation first.

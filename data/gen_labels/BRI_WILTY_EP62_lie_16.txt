Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn on whether this person is lying or not. The main thing that stands out is that they keep raising their eyebrows—like, really consistently—whenever they're answering the question. It's not a big, dramatic lift, but it's noticeable enough that I'd catch it on a second watch. Now, I know raised eyebrows can mean a lot of things: sometimes people do it when they're genuinely surprised or trying to process something, or even just to seem more engaged. Like, maybe they're not expecting the question and it's catching them off guard in a neutral way. That could totally be why they're doing it, and not because they're hiding something.

But then again, I've read that when people lie, especially if they're trying to be smooth about it, they might unconsciously show micro-expressions like that—like a flicker of tension or uncertainty. And the thing is, they're not doing *anything else* that screams "lying" to me. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses or forced smiles. Normally, if someone's deceptive, you'd see more signs like that—maybe a little too much blinking or shifting in their seat. But here, they're just sitting there, talking normally, with just those raised eyebrows. So that actually makes me think it might be something else, like they're genuinely confused by the question or just have a habit of raising their brows when they're thinking.

On the flip side, though, if this is a high-stakes moment—like they're being asked something they don't want to answer—those eyebrows might be their only tell. Maybe they're trying so hard not to show nervousness that it's just that one tiny thing slipping through. But honestly, the lack of other cues is throwing me off. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* other physical reaction, even if it's subtle. So I'm leaning toward it being a red herring—like, they're not lying, but the eyebrows are just a quirk. But I can't rule out deception entirely because sometimes people lie without showing obvious signs. It's really hard to say for sure without knowing the context of the conversation. I'd say it's possible they're being deceptive, but it's equally possible they're just being thoughtful, and the eyebrows are a coincidence. I'd need to see more of the clip or hear what they're saying to feel confident about it.

Based on the clip, I’m leaning toward the possibility that this person might be lying, though I can’t say that with complete certainty. One thing that really stands out is their consistent eyebrow raising while answering the question. It’s subtle, but noticeable enough that it seems deliberate or at least more than just a random expression. While raised eyebrows can mean many things—surprise, confusion, or engagement—there’s also research suggesting that such micro-expressions can surface when someone is uneasy or trying to conceal something. 

What complicates things is that the usual signs of deception, like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, awkward pauses, or forced smiles, aren’t present here. They appear calm and collected overall, which would typically cast doubt on the idea that they’re lying. However, the absence of these other cues makes the eyebrow raise stand out even more, as though it’s the one tell they can’t hide. If this is a high-pressure situation, that subtle tension in their expression could be their only slip.

While it’s also possible that the eyebrow movement is just a habitual or thoughtful gesture, the consistency and context slightly push me toward suspicion. I wouldn’t confidently say they’re lying, but the evidence leans more in that direction than not. Without additional context or more of their behavior, it’s hard to be sure, but my instinct is that there’s at least some deception going on here.

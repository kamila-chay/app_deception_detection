Watching the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're not smiling, frowning, or doing any of those nervous little gestures like fidgeting or covering their face. The thing that stands out is that they keep looking down, not making eye contact with whoever they're talking to. At first glance, that makes me think maybe they're avoiding the question, which people often do when they're lying. But then I remember that looking down isn't always a sign of deception—it can just be how someone naturally acts when they're shy, thoughtful, or even just not used to being on camera. 

I'm also noticing they don't seem rushed or stressed. No quick blinking, no awkward pauses where their mouth's shut tight, nothing that screams "this person is hiding something." If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic signs—like fidgeting or a forced smile—but they're just... steady. Maybe they're actually being honest and just have a habit of looking down when they speak. It's hard to say for sure though, because eye contact (or lack thereof) is super subjective. Some cultures or personalities just don't make eye contact naturally, so it could be totally normal for them. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, they might be really good at hiding it, which is possible. But the absence of other nervous behaviors makes me lean toward them being truthful. Still, I can't rule out the possibility that they're just very composed under pressure. Honestly, without more context—like what they're saying or the situation—it's tough to pin down. My gut says they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just feels more like they're just... being themselves, not trying to pull a fast one.

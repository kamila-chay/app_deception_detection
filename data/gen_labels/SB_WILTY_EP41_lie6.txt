Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying, but I can share what stands out to me. The person seems pretty tense—there's a consistent scowl and those furrowed eyebrows, like they're genuinely upset or frustrated about whatever they're talking about. Their lips are pulled back tightly, almost like they're biting back words, and their chin is pointed down slightly, which feels like they're holding tension in their jaw. They keep glancing sideways instead of looking directly at whoever they're talking to, and their head is tilted a bit to the side, which makes me wonder if they're trying to avoid eye contact because they're uncomfortable. The awkward pauses where their mouth stays closed also feel a bit off—like they're searching for words, but I'm not sure if that's because they're making something up or just struggling to explain something difficult.

On the flip side, though, that scowl and the tension could easily just mean they're annoyed about the *topic* they're discussing, not necessarily that they're lying. Maybe they're upset about the situation they're describing, or they're just naturally expressive when they're serious. I've seen people look like that when they're being honest but frustrated—like when they're trying to correct someone or explain something they find irritating. The sideways glance and head tilt might just be their normal way of thinking or processing, not a sign of deception. And honestly, avoiding eye contact isn't a great lie detector; some people just don't like direct eye contact even when they're telling the truth. 

I guess what's really making me lean slightly toward deception is that combination of the tight-lipped expression, the awkward pauses, and the avoidance of direct gaze—those feel like they line up more with the classic "signs of stress" people show when they're not being truthful. But I keep second-guessing because the whole thing could just be them being really stressed about the subject, not lying about it. Without knowing what they're saying or the context, it's super hard to tell. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it based on this alone. It's definitely not clear-cut.

Looking at the video, I find myself leaning more toward the possibility that they might be lying, though I can’t be entirely sure. Their repeated eyebrow raises and excessive blinking, especially with the exaggerated closing of the eyes, come across as classic signs of nervousness, which often accompany deception. The slight downturn of the lip corners and the way the chin moves upward as if bracing for impact also suggest underlying tension. While it’s true that they maintain eye contact and nod frequently, which is somewhat uncommon for someone lying, their gaze flickering down and to the side indicates distraction or discomfort—behaviors that could reflect an internal struggle with dishonesty. The steady eye contact might even be an overcompensation to mask their deceit, rather than genuine openness.

However, I hesitate to be entirely certain because their engagement and head movements could equally be signs of anxiety over the situation rather than outright lying. It’s possible they are simply stressed or eager to seem credible, which can mimic deceptive cues. Without hearing what they actually say, it’s difficult to pinpoint whether the tension stems from deception or just nervousness. Still, given the combination of subtle but telling signals, I tend to lean toward the conclusion that they probably aren’t being fully truthful, though I wouldn’t call it definitive.

Looking at the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are a few things that make me lean toward it, but others that definitely complicate things. The way they kept raising their eyebrows and blinking a lot, especially with that exaggerated eye closing, feels like classic nervous energy. It’s the kind of thing I’ve seen people do when they’re trying to seem calm but are actually stressed, like they’re overcompensating. And the lip corners pulled down, almost like a slight frown, plus the chin moving up like they’re bracing themselves—it all adds up to tension. They were nodding a lot while looking at the person they were talking to, which is interesting because liars often avoid eye contact, but here they’re actually making it. Still, their gaze kept flicking down and sideways too, which feels off—like they’re not fully present, maybe because they’re rehearsing what they’re saying.

But here’s where I hesitate: that consistent eye contact with the interlocutor is a strong counterpoint. If they were lying, I’d expect more avoidance, not this steady (if a bit tense) focus. Maybe they’re just really anxious about the situation—like if they’re being interviewed about something sensitive, not necessarily lying. The head tilting and nodding also read as engaged, not deceptive. It could be they’re genuinely trying to be honest but are overwhelmed, so their body language is just showing that stress instead of deception. I’ve seen people act this way when they’re scared to disappoint someone, not when they’re hiding something. Honestly, the blinking and eyebrow stuff could just be them being naturally expressive or tired, not a sign of lying. I’d want to hear the actual words they’re saying to be sure, because without context, it’s really hard to tell if the tension is from guilt or just the weight of the conversation. I’m leaning toward them *not* lying, but I’m not confident at all—there’s too much that could be misinterpreted.

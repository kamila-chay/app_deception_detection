Looking at the video, my first impression is that the person seems pretty steady—no obvious fidgeting or nervous ticks. They're mostly looking directly at whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. Like, when people lie, they often avoid eye contact or look away a lot, but here they're keeping that gaze pretty consistent. The only thing that stands out a little is that occasional sideways glance—they're not staring dead ahead, but glancing off to the side once or twice. I wonder if that's just them thinking or maybe glancing at something in the room, not necessarily lying.  

But then again, I've heard that some people who lie actually overcompensate with too much eye contact, so maybe that's why they're looking so directly. Still, the sideways look feels more like a natural pause than a tell. And honestly, there's nothing else going on—no fake smiles, no lip-biting, no frantic blinking. If they were making it up, I'd expect at least a hint of tension in their face or hands, but everything seems relaxed.  

On the flip side, I can't totally rule out lying just because they're looking at the person. Some people are really good at hiding it, and that sideways glance could be a subtle sign they're not fully present. Maybe they're rehearsing what to say next, which isn't the same as lying, but it's not exactly "natural" either. I mean, if I were lying, I'd probably fidget more, but everyone's different.  

Honestly, though, the lack of other red flags makes me lean toward them being truthful. The eye contact feels genuine, and the sideways look doesn't seem forced—it's subtle, like how people look away when they're just thinking. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. People are complicated, and without more context, it's hard to be sure. If I had to guess based on what I see, I'd say they're telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain. It just feels... calm.

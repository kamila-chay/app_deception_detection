Looking at the clip, I’m inclined to think that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their eyes are opened unusually wide at times—almost exaggerated—which can come across as a deliberate attempt to appear more attentive or sincere than they truly feel. Additionally, the way they maintain unwavering eye contact throughout the conversation feels somewhat forced. From what I understand, people who are being deceptive often overcompensate by overdoing eye expressions and staring directly at others to avoid seeming evasive.

That said, I still hesitate to be fully certain. It’s possible that this person is simply expressive or that they naturally maintain steady eye contact when speaking. There’s also no obvious signs of lying like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or fake smiles, which makes me question whether the wide eyes are really a reliable indicator here.

Still, the combination of the exaggerated eye expression and intense gaze seems off in this context and leans me toward thinking deception is more likely than not. Of course, without more context or additional behavior to analyze, I can’t say for sure. People can be complex, and these cues might just be part of their usual mannerisms. Overall, I would say there’s a notable chance they’re not entirely honest, though I wouldn’t rule out other explanations just yet.

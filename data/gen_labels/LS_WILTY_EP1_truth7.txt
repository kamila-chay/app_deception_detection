Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels like they're probably telling the truth. They were smiling and laughing pretty naturally throughout—like, not forced or overly stiff—which usually makes me lean toward sincerity. Their eyes were wide open (exaggerated, but in a way that seemed genuine surprise, not like they were trying to look innocent), and they kept their palms up with arms open, which feels like an open, non-threatening posture. No fidgeting either—like no hands rubbing or touching their face—which often happens when people are nervous about lying. And their gaze was mostly on the person they were talking to, with some down and sideways glances that just looked like they were thinking, not avoiding eye contact.  

But I can see why it might be tricky. Sometimes people who are lying *do* smile more to seem friendly, or they might overdo the "surprise" to seem convincing. That raised eyebrow and wide eyes could be rehearsed, like they're trying too hard to look truthful. And the slight frown they had—well, it wasn't a scowl, but it looked like they were genuinely processing something, which could just mean they're concentrating, not lying. I also wonder if the context matters—if they were sharing something emotional, the frown might just be sadness, not deception.  

Still, the lack of classic "nervous" tells (no blinking, no arm-crossing, no head-shaking) and the relaxed, open body language really stands out. Most of the time, when people are lying, they have *some* subtle tension—like touching their neck or avoiding eye contact. Here, it just felt... effortless. Like they were just sharing a story without hiding anything. But yeah, I'm not ruling out that they might be a really good actor. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the situation, but based on the video alone, it leans truthful to me. I'd say "probably true," but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

From what I can see in the clip, the person seems engaged in the conversation—they're making consistent eye contact with the other person, nodding along, and tilting their head slightly, which often reads as attentive or curious. That part feels pretty natural, like they're genuinely listening. But then there's this thing with their blinking—like, they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying to avoid looking directly at something or just can't seem to settle their eyes. I've noticed that when people are stressed or faking it, they sometimes blink a lot, but it could also just be dry eyes or the lighting being harsh. 

The smile they're wearing is there too—lip corners up, no frowning or scowling—so it doesn't look forced in a way that screams "fake," but I wonder if it's a bit too steady. Like, when people are really comfortable, their smiles shift a little, but this one seems kind of fixed. And the head tilt? That’s usually a sign of interest, but it’s hard to tell if it’s because they’re trying to seem sincere or just genuinely curious. 

On the flip side, they’re not doing any classic "lying" tells—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no nervous hands. If they were trying to cover something up, I’d expect more of those signs. Maybe they’re just nervous about the conversation, not lying. But the frequent blinking sticks with me—it’s such a small thing, but it feels off in a way that makes me lean toward deception. Still, I’m not sure. Could be they’re just tired, or the camera’s making them squint. Honestly, without knowing what they’re talking about, it’s really hard to say. I’d guess they might be hiding something, but I’d feel way more confident if there were more clear signs, like a shaky voice or inconsistent gestures. Right now, it’s just... a gut feeling with a lot of "maybe."

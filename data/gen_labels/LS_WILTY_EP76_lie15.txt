This is a bit complicated, but leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying seems reasonable. While they do maintain some eye contact, which typically signals honesty, the frequent glances downward suggest they’re not fully comfortable or straightforward. Avoiding direct eye contact during conversation can sometimes hint at deception, and here it feels like that might be the case. Their palms-up gesture could indicate openness, yet it might also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere and mask dishonesty. The tilted head might be a thoughtful or casual gesture, but combined with the other cues, it could also be part of an act.

Although the absence of obvious nervous habits—no fidgeting or excessive blinking—could suggest they’re truthful, it’s also possible they’re simply skilled at hiding signs of lying or naturally composed even when deceptive. The calm demeanor doesn’t entirely rule out deception; some people manage to keep their composure while being untruthful.

Given these mixed signals—the downward glances, the potentially strategic palms-up gesture, the composed behavior—I find myself leaning more toward thinking they might be lying, though I’m not entirely confident. The evidence isn’t definitive, but there’s enough here to suspect they may not be telling the whole truth.

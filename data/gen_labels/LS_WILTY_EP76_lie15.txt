Hmm, this is tricky. So I'm watching someone talk, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. They seem to be making eye contact with the person they're talking to—which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But then they keep glancing down a lot, like they're not quite meeting the gaze fully. I've heard that when people avoid direct eye contact while speaking, it can sometimes signal discomfort or deception, but I'm not 100% sure that's the case here. They also have their palms up, which often looks like someone trying to seem open or sincere—like they're not hiding anything. But then there's that head tilt to the side; I've seen people do that when they're thinking or being playful, not necessarily lying.  

On the flip side, the lack of nervous habits stands out. No fidgeting, no over-the-top expressions, no weird blinking—just calm, steady speech. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells, like touching their face or shifting around. But maybe they're just really good at hiding it? Or maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure. I mean, some people don't show stress at all when they're being deceptive, especially if they're practiced.  

The palms-up thing is really throwing me off. If they were trying to seem honest, why would they do that? But it could also just be a natural gesture they do when they're talking—like they're emphasizing a point. And the head side-turn... I don't know, maybe they're just gesturing while speaking, not avoiding anything.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The down gaze makes me lean toward "maybe lying," but the palms up and lack of nervousness make me think "probably not." It's like the video's giving me mixed signals. I'd say it's closer to truth, but I can't rule out lying entirely. There's just not enough clear evidence either way. If I had to guess, I'd say they're telling the truth, but I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. It's one of those moments where the behavior feels neutral, not obviously deceptive.

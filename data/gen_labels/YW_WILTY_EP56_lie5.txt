Looking at the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn because the person seems to be doing a lot of things that *usually* make me think someone's being truthful. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is marked true—and they're nodding along while they speak. Plus, there's a subtle smile (lip corners up), which feels natural, not forced. I don't see any of the classic "nervous" signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or rapid blinking. If anything, the way they're engaging—leaning in slightly with that nod and steady gaze—reads like they're genuinely trying to connect or be convincing, which often happens when people *are* telling the truth.  

But then I start second-guessing myself because I know lying can look calm too. Maybe they're a practiced liar who's learned to keep eye contact and nod to seem credible, especially if they're rehearsed or in a high-stakes situation. The smile might even be a little too smooth—like they're trying too hard to seem friendly to cover up the lie. I’ve heard that some people overcompensate with "positive" gestures when they’re nervous, so that could be a red flag if it feels off.  

The tricky part is that all these "truthful" signs (eye contact, nodding) are actually *more* common in truthful people than in liars, according to what I’ve read. But I also know that context matters—maybe they’re just naturally expressive, or the situation is one where they’d *want* to seem sincere. Without hearing the actual words, it’s hard to tell if they’re dodging questions or just answering straightforwardly.  

Honestly, I’m leaning toward them being truthful just based on the absence of deception cues, but I can’t rule out that they’re a good liar. It’s the kind of thing where if I had to guess, I’d say "truth" because the behavior doesn’t scream "lying" to me, but I’d want to hear the conversation to be sure. Like, maybe they’re smiling because they’re happy about what they’re saying, not because they’re hiding something. Still, it’s not a slam dunk—I’d say it’s a maybe, but probably not deception.

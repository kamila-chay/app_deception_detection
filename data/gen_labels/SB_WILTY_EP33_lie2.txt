Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly not 100% sure if they're lying or not, but I can see why someone might think they are. The person seems really fidgety—like they're blinking way more than normal, almost like they're trying not to look at the camera. Their eyebrows are raised a lot, which usually feels like surprise or maybe even confusion, but it could also be a sign they're nervous about answering. And that mouth thing? They open it really wide when they talk, but then it snaps shut awkwardly, like they're struggling to get the words out. It’s kind of jarring, and the lips are pushed out a bit too, like they're tensing up. Then there's the head stuff—they keep tilting it sideways and shaking it, and their eyes are mostly down, not meeting the camera. That makes me lean toward deception, because people often look away or fidget when they're not being straight.  

But here’s where I hesitate: I’ve seen people act like this when they’re just stressed or tired, not necessarily lying. Maybe they’re just bad at being on camera, or they’re genuinely upset about the topic. The raised eyebrows could be real surprise—they might’ve been caught off guard by the question, not trying to hide something. And the head shaking? It could be a "no" to something else entirely, like disagreeing with a point, not denying a lie. The awkward pauses with their mouth closed might just mean they’re thinking hard, which happens when telling the truth too. I mean, I’ve had to pause like that when I’m trying to remember details, and I wasn’t lying.  

Honestly, the cues are mixed. The gaze down and the fidgeting are red flags for me, but they’re not impossible to explain away. If I had to guess without any other context, I’d say deception is possible, but I wouldn’t bet on it. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want to hear the actual answer or see more of the conversation to be sure. Like, maybe they’re just not a natural speaker, and all this is just them being uncomfortable. I’d say it’s *leaning* toward deception, but I’m not convinced enough to say for sure. It’s easy to misread body language, especially when it’s subtle like this.

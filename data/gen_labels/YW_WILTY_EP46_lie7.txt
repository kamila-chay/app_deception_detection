Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video. I'm watching someone who's got their arms open and palms facing up—like they're being completely transparent, which usually leans toward honesty in my experience. They're also looking directly at the person they're talking to, not avoiding eye contact, and their chin is tilted up just slightly, like they're leaning in to listen or emphasize something. Those open gestures and direct gaze make me think they're trying to seem genuine, which honestly feels more like truth-telling than lying.  

But then I keep circling back to that chin movement. I've heard some people say a subtle chin lift can be a nervous tic—like when someone's rehearsing or trying too hard to seem calm. Maybe they're overcompensating because they *are* lying, and the open posture is just a cover. It's weird because usually, liars cross their arms or hide their hands, so the open arms and palms feel counterintuitive for deception. Still, I know some people fake openness to seem trustworthy, so I can't rule that out.  

Also, the way they're speaking—no awkward pauses, no fidgeting—makes me lean toward truthfulness. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical tells like blinking a lot or touching their face, but that's not happening here. Though... maybe they're just really good at controlling themselves? People who lie often practice, so it's possible.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The cues mostly point to honesty (open posture, steady gaze), but that chin thing nags at me. It's hard to say for sure without hearing the content of what they're saying—maybe they're just passionate about the topic. I'd say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth based on what I see, but I wouldn't bet money on it. Deception is so nuanced, and body language alone can be misleading. I'd want to see more context before I'd feel confident either way.

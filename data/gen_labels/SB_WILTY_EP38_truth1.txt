Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them being truthful, but honestly? It's tricky to say for sure just from behavior alone. What stands out to me is how steady their gaze is—they're looking directly at the camera (what I'd assume is the person they're talking to), which often feels more natural when someone's being honest. There's no fidgeting, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to speak, and no nervous tells like excessive blinking or covering their mouth. The head tilt they do feels like a natural, engaged thing—like they're listening or thinking, not like they're trying to fake something. 

That said, I know some people can be really good at hiding nervousness, especially if they've practiced or are just naturally calm. Maybe they're rehearsed, or maybe they're just not the type to show stress when they're lying. The "gaze up" detail is interesting too—some research suggests people look up when recalling real memories, which might support truth-telling, but it's not a hard rule. Honestly, the absence of classic "lying" cues here makes me think they're probably being genuine, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just feels... relaxed, in a way that doesn't scream "I'm hiding something." Still, without more context, it's hard to be certain—people are complicated.

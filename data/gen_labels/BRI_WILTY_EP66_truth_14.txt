Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from watching a clip. The person is definitely looking directly at whoever they're talking to the whole time—no looking away, no glancing down or sideways. That's the first thing that stands out to me. I've heard that avoiding eye contact can sometimes be a sign of lying, so the opposite might suggest they're being honest? But honestly, I'm not sure if that's a solid rule. Some people just naturally make eye contact, and others might be good at faking it even when they're lying. Like, maybe they're just really focused on the conversation or trying to seem trustworthy, not necessarily because they're telling the truth.

On the other hand, there's nothing else going on that I'd usually associate with deception. No nervous fidgeting, no weird smiles or frowns, no awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words. They just seem calm and composed, holding that gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe some tension—like lips tightening or fingers twitching—but there's none of that. It's almost... too steady? Like they're not even thinking about it. But then again, if someone's practiced at lying, they might suppress all those signs on purpose. I mean, I've seen people who can keep a poker face perfectly while saying something completely false.

The thing is, I don't know the context. What are they talking about? If it's something super personal or high-stakes, even a truthful person might get nervous and look away. But here, they're not. So maybe that *does* lean toward truth? But I'm also second-guessing because I've learned that body language is super subjective. Maybe they're just really good at acting, or maybe they're not even lying about anything serious. Like, if they're just confirming a simple fact—say, "I had coffee this morning"—they wouldn't need to fake it, so the calm eye contact makes sense. But if they're denying something big, I'd expect more signs... or maybe not, if they're confident.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The steady eye contact feels like a point in favor of truth, but it's not definitive. I'd probably lean toward them being truthful just because there's no obvious "tells," but I'd also want to hear the actual words they're saying to get the full picture. Without that, it's just a gut feeling based on what I'm seeing, and gut feelings can be wrong. I'd say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet on it—there are too many ways for someone to hide it or for the situation to be different than it seems.

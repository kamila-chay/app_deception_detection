Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but I'll walk through what I'm noticing. The person in the video keeps looking upward—like they're staring at the ceiling or off to the side—throughout most of the clip. That's the only thing really standing out to me. Now, I know people often look up when they're trying to remember something, which could mean they're being truthful and just thinking hard. Like, if someone asks you where you left your keys, you might glance up while mentally retracing your steps. But I've also heard that when people fabricate stories, they sometimes do the same thing—looking up to "construct" a false memory. So that's a bit of a toss-up for me.  

What throws me off a little is how calm they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no shifting eyes like they're avoiding the question. They're not even blinking a lot or touching their face, which are things I'd expect if they were nervous about lying. If they were really making it up, I'd almost expect them to seem more tense, but they just seem... focused. Like they're genuinely processing the question.  

On the flip side, though, if they *were* lying, they might be trying too hard to seem relaxed—which could explain why they're not showing classic signs. Maybe they're practiced at it? Or maybe the upward gaze is just a habit for them, not related to deception at all. I mean, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking about something, not necessarily lying.  

So yeah, it's really hard to pin down. The upward gaze is the only thing that feels *slightly* off, but it's not a sure thing. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward "not lying" just because they seem so composed, but I'd be nervous about calling it a solid truth. It's possible they're deceiving me, but it's also totally plausible they're just someone who thinks by looking up. Honestly, without more context—like what they're being asked about—it's almost impossible to tell. I'd want to see the whole conversation before I felt confident either way.

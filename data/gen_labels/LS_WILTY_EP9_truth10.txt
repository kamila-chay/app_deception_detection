Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from body language alone. The way they're holding their gaze directly at the person they're talking to feels natural—like they're genuinely engaged, not avoiding eye contact, which often happens when someone's being deceptive. Their mouth is relaxed too, with the corners slightly up and lips just... there, not tight or forced like I've seen in some "fake" smiles. They're even tilting their head a little, which usually signals curiosity or openness, not suspicion.  

That said, I keep circling back to the frequent blinking. I know people often blink more when they're stressed or lying, so that caught my eye. But then I thought—maybe they're just naturally a fast blinker, or maybe they're in a bright room, or even just concentrating hard on what they're saying. If they were lying, I'd expect more of the other signs: fidgeting, tense jaw, avoiding eye contact, or that stiff "lip corners down" look. But none of that's here. The absence of those things feels more telling than the blinking alone.  

I guess the counterargument is that some really practiced liars can mask all the obvious signs, so the blinking might be the only clue. But honestly, the way they're interacting—no awkward pauses, no hands covering their face, just a calm, steady presence—makes me think the blinking is probably just a habit. Like, maybe they're just tired or have something in their eye, not that they're hiding something. It’s hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying, but based on the video alone, I’d say the behavior lines up more with someone being truthful than not. Still, I wouldn’t bet the farm on it—body language is never perfect, and I’m not a lie detector.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues are subtle. What stands out to me is that they keep raising their eyebrows really high—almost like they're surprised or trying to emphasize something—and their eyes open up super wide, almost exaggeratedly. At first glance, that makes me wonder if they're trying too hard to seem honest, like they're overcompensating. I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes do things like that to appear open or innocent, so it feels like a possible sign of deception. But then I also think, maybe they're just naturally expressive? Some people have that "big-eyed" look when they're talking, especially if they're nervous or excited about something, not necessarily lying. 

The thing that makes me hesitate is how *calm* they seem otherwise. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact (wait, actually, the video shows they're not looking directly at the person they're talking to—gaze is down or sideways, which can sometimes mean they're avoiding truth—but they're also not doing things like biting their lip, scratching, or shifting around, which I'd expect if they were stressed about lying). If they were lying, I'd probably expect more nervous energy, like frequent blinking or hands moving, but here it's just those two things with everything else pretty still. That makes me think maybe they're just being a little awkward or distracted, not necessarily deceptive. 

I also keep wondering if the context matters—like, are they telling a story about something they're genuinely unsure about, or is it a high-pressure situation? If it's the latter, the exaggerated eye opening could just be their way of coping with stress, not lying. And honestly, I've read that people often misread these cues because we all have different baseline behaviors. Maybe this person always talks with their eyebrows raised, and it's nothing to do with truthfulness at all. 

So yeah, I'm leaning a little toward "maybe deception" because of the eyebrow and eye cues, but I'm not at all sure. It could just be their normal way of talking, or they could be genuinely confused about the question. Without more context or other behaviors, it's really hard to say for certain. I'd say it's a close call, but I wouldn't bet on it either way.

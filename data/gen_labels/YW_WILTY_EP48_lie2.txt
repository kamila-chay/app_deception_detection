Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip... the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They're making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really listening—and they keep leaning in slightly, like they're fully present in the conversation. I don't see any of the usual stuff people might expect if someone's lying: no fidgeting with their hands, no nervous blinking, no looking away a lot, not even a single awkward pause where they seem stuck. They're just... talking normally, like they're comfortable with what they're saying.

But here's where I hesitate: I know some people are really good at hiding it, right? Like, they might not show any of those classic signs because they're practiced or just naturally chill under pressure. Maybe they're not lying, but they're also not super emotional about it—just giving a straightforward answer. Or maybe they *are* lying, but they're so focused on not giving themselves away that they're actually *too* composed. I've heard that some skilled liars actually *over*-control themselves, making them seem unnaturally calm. So the fact that they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact could *also* be a sign they're rehearsed or trying too hard to seem honest.

Honestly, the thing that stands out the most is that steady gaze and the leaning in—they feel like signs of genuine engagement, not someone dodging the truth. But I can't rule out that it's just a very good performance. Like, maybe they're not lying, but I'm not going to swear on it either. It's the kind of thing where if I had more context—like what they're actually saying—I might feel more confident. As it is? I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'd say "maybe" instead of "yes." It doesn't *feel* like deception to me, but I know it's easy to be fooled. The absence of nervous tells makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying, but it doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth. Hard to say for sure without more to go on.

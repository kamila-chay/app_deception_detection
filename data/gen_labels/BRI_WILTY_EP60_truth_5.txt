Hmm, this is tricky because it's hard to tell from just the video, but based on what I'm seeing... Okay, so the person is looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me—people often avoid direct eye contact when lying. But they also have their head turned slightly to the side, which I've heard some people say means deception, though honestly, I'm not sure if that's reliable. They raised their eyebrows a few times too—like when they're surprised or processing something, which could go either way. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous stuff, like fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact completely, but they don't seem to be doing any of that. Their face is pretty neutral, no fake smiles or scowling, which actually feels more relaxed than someone trying to cover up a lie. 

On the flip side, though... maybe they're just really good at hiding it? Like, some people don't show obvious tells, so the lack of nervous gestures might not mean anything. And that head tilt—could be just a natural way of listening, or it could be a subtle sign they're not fully engaged. I mean, I've seen people do that when they're trying to remember something, which could be a lie, but it could also just be them thinking. Honestly, the most convincing part for me is the steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—they're not darting their eyes around or looking down like they're avoiding something. That makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I can't be 100% sure. It's possible they're just calm under pressure, or maybe they're used to being questioned. I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'd still be a little unsure because it's so hard to read someone's mind from just a video clip. Like, it *feels* genuine, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

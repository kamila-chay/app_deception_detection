Honestly, while there are no glaring signs of deception—no obvious fidgeting, no stiff or forced expressions, and no classic giveaways like lip biting or excessive blinking—the way they frequently look down and glance sideways, along with the repeated head tilts, does raise some questions. These behaviors often suggest discomfort or an attempt to hide something, which can be associated with lying. It’s true that people might look away or tilt their heads when concentrating or feeling nervous without any intent to deceive, but combined with those gaze shifts, it slightly nudges me toward suspecting they might not be entirely truthful. They don’t display the typical stress cues, which might mean they’re either a very calm liar or simply reserved, but without additional context, such as what they are saying or the stakes involved, it’s hard to be certain. Still, based on the subtle but consistent indicators in their body language, I would lean somewhat toward the possibility that they are being deceptive, even if the evidence isn’t definitive.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly not 100% sure if they're lying or not—it's really tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall, which is interesting because I often expect liars to fidget or avoid eye contact, but here they're actually making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels a bit counter to what I'd expect. They're also tilting their head slightly while they speak, and their eyebrows are raised quite a bit, almost like they're processing something or trying to seem engaged. The chin moving upward is another thing I keep noticing—they're lifting their chin just a little when they talk, which I've heard can sometimes signal uncertainty or an attempt to appear more confident, but it's subtle.

On the other hand, there's nothing really *off* about their body language in a way that screams "deception." No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no obvious signs of stress like rapid blinking or covering their mouth. The head tilt and raised eyebrows could just be natural habits—they might be someone who naturally tilts their head when listening or has expressive eyebrows without meaning to. I've seen people do that all the time when they're just trying to be polite or thoughtful, not necessarily lying. Plus, the fact that they're maintaining eye contact makes me wonder if the "deception" label might be a bit of a misread, because most of the classic "lie" cues (like looking away or fidgeting) aren't there.

But then again, sometimes people who lie *do* try to appear overly attentive—like they're overcompensating by staring directly at you and tilting their head to seem sincere. The raised eyebrows could also be a sign of nervousness disguised as surprise, especially if they're trying to recall a story. I'm really split on this one. It's hard to say without knowing what they're even talking about. If they were just describing a boring event, the head tilt might mean nothing. But if they're making up something specific, those little cues could add up. Honestly, I'd lean toward them being truthful just because the lack of other "red flags" feels stronger to me than the few things I *do* notice. But I'm not confident at all—body language is so context-dependent, and I could easily be missing something obvious. Maybe it's just their natural way of talking.

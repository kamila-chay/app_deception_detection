The person in the video displays several behaviors that make me lean toward the possibility they're not being entirely truthful. Their increased blinking and consistently raised eyebrows suggest discomfort, which can sometimes be a sign of deception. Additionally, their frequent sideways glances and the way they turn their head slightly while nodding seem somewhat evasive and atypical for someone fully at ease. While these cues alone don't confirm dishonesty, they collectively create a picture that raises suspicion. 

It's true that blinking a lot might be due to fatigue or irritation, and looking away can simply be a natural response when thinking or feeling awkward on camera. The fact that their arms remain open could indicate an attempt to appear relaxed and honest, which complicates the interpretation. However, the head-turning gesture is often associated with deception, even if that's not always reliable, and their nodding could reflect internal conflict or uncertainty rather than straightforward truthfulness. 

Given these mixed signals, while I can't say for certain that the person is lying, the overall pattern of body language makes me incline more toward the idea that they might be withholding the full truth or feeling uneasy about it. Without additional context or verbal cues, it's difficult to be sure, but my impression leans toward some degree of deception.

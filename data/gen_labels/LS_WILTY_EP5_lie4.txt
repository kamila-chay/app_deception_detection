Hmm, this is tricky. From what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems a bit fidgety—like they're blinking a lot more than usual, and their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently while they're talking. They also keep looking sideways a bit, not directly at whoever they're speaking to, and they turn their head slightly to the side while nodding. At first glance, those things *do* make me lean toward them not being fully comfortable, which sometimes happens when people are being cautious or... well, not entirely truthful. But honestly, I'm not sure.  

I mean, blinking a lot could just mean they're tired, or maybe they have something in their eye—people do that all the time without it meaning anything. And the sideways glance? I've noticed some folks naturally look away when they're thinking, or maybe they're just not used to being on camera. I've seen my own family do that when they're trying to remember something, and they were totally honest. Plus, they keep their arms open the whole time, which usually feels like they're trying to seem approachable or relaxed—like they're not hiding anything. If they were lying, I'd expect them to cross their arms or fidget with their hands, but they're not doing that at all.  

The head turning to the side is weird though—I've heard people say that's a sign of deception, but I don't know if that's actually reliable. Maybe they're just gesturing naturally, or the camera's making them feel awkward. And the nodding? That's usually a sign of agreement, so if they're nodding while saying something they're not sure about, it might be confusing, but it doesn't *prove* they're lying.  

Honestly, I think I'm overthinking it. People act differently when they're being filmed, and these little things don't add up to a clear "lie" for me. It could be they're just nervous about the situation—not because they're hiding something, but because they're stressed or unsure how to answer. I'd need to see more context, like what they're actually saying, to feel confident about this. Right now, I'm leaning toward "maybe not lying," but I wouldn't bet on it. It's just hard to tell from body language alone—there are too many other reasons for those signs.

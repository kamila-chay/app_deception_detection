I watched the clip a couple times to be sure, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. What stood out most was how they kept staring right at the person they were talking to—no looking away, no shifting eyes. And they had this tight frown, like they were genuinely annoyed or frustrated, with their lips pulled down instead of smiling. At first glance, that direct eye contact makes me lean toward them being truthful, because when people lie, they often avoid eye contact or seem nervous, right? Like, I'd expect more blinking or fidgeting, but they didn't seem to fidget at all—just stayed still, locked in that scowl.  

But then I started second-guessing myself. Maybe the frown is part of the lie? Like, they're trying to seem angry to cover up they're lying, or maybe they're just really upset about the situation and that's why they're frowning. I've seen people fake anger to deflect when they're hiding something. And honestly, the fact that they *didn't* do the classic "lie signs" (no awkward pauses, no lip-biting, no avoiding eyes) is weirdly suspicious—it's almost *too* calm. Sometimes really good liars are unnervingly composed, so maybe they're just that confident.  

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth and genuinely frustrated, the frown and eye contact would make sense—like, they're upset about whatever they're saying, not hiding it. And the absence of nervous tells usually points to truth, not deception. I keep going back to that gaze: if they were lying, I'd expect them to look away or glance down, but they didn't. It feels like they're trying to be honest, even if they're not smiling.  

I'm not 100% sure, though. It's hard to say without knowing the context—like, what were they even talking about? If it was something super personal or upsetting, that frown could be real emotion, not a mask. But if it was a simple question they didn't want to answer, the lack of nervousness makes me wonder. Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear the actual words before I'd feel confident. It's one of those clips where the behavior *looks* truthful, but you can't rule out that they're just really good at it.

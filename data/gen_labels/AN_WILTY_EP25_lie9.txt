I watched the clip a couple of times, and while it's tricky to be certain, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying. They maintained strong eye contact throughout, which at first made me think they were truthful since people who lie often avoid eye contact or seem nervous. But the fact that they showed no typical signs of nervousness—no blinking, no fidgeting—almost comes across as unnervingly calm, which can sometimes indicate that someone is trying too hard to appear honest.  

That tight frown and the serious expression could be genuine frustration, but it also might be a deliberate attempt to mask deception. I've seen people fake anger or frustration to deflect suspicion when they’re hiding something. So the combination of an intense gaze and a controlled, almost rigid demeanor makes me question their sincerity.  

If they were telling the truth and genuinely upset, the absence of nervous tells would make sense. But the fact that they avoid the usual subtle signs of lying by being overly composed could mean they’ve rehearsed this or are particularly skilled at hiding it. Without the context of what they were saying, it’s hard to be sure, but the overall impression I get leans more toward deception than honesty. I wouldn’t say I’m confident, but I find myself suspecting they might not be entirely truthful.

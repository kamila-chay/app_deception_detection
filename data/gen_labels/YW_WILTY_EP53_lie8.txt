Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone who's speaking to another person, and the first thing that stands out is how steady their eye contact is—they're really looking right at the other person the whole time, no shifting eyes or looking away. That's interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I also know that's not always true. Sometimes people who are lying might stare extra hard to seem honest, so that could actually be a red flag. But on the flip side, if they were genuinely nervous or lying, I'd expect to see some fidgeting—like tapping fingers, playing with hair, or even just that slight twitch of the face. But here, they're totally still. No blinking too much, no awkward pauses where they stop talking, no weird mouth movements or head tilts. They just... talk normally while looking at the other person.

I'm leaning a bit toward them telling the truth just because they seem so relaxed. If I were guessing, I'd say someone who's really lying often gets tense—like their hands might start moving, or their voice might crack. But this feels calm, almost too calm. Wait, though... that calmness could be the opposite of what I'd expect. Like, maybe they've practiced this so much they're not showing any signs, and the fact that they're *too* composed is suspicious. But honestly, I'm not sure. I've seen people who are super good at hiding it, but I've also seen people who are just naturally chill and don't fidget at all, even when they're being honest. Without hearing what they're saying or knowing the context, it's hard to tell. The absence of nervous tells usually makes me think truth, but I keep second-guessing because deception can look so uneventful. I guess I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's just not enough to go on. If I had to put it in words, I'd say "this looks like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying," but I can't rule out that they're just really good at pretending.

Looking at this clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, but honestly? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, they kept looking down and sideways a lot—like, whenever they weren't directly making eye contact, they'd glance away or down, which often feels like someone avoiding the truth. I've noticed that in real life, people who're nervous or hiding something tend to do that, especially if they're talking to someone they're trying to convince. And they were tilting their head a bit, which sometimes comes off as disingenuous when it's not natural—like they're trying too hard to seem engaged.  

But then there's the open-armed thing. They had their arms wide open the whole time, which usually screams "I'm being genuine!" You don't see that when people are lying—they tend to cross their arms or fidget. And they never broke character with a smile or a laugh, which feels odd if they were just making stuff up. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a tiny smirk or a nervous chuckle, but they just stayed calm and quiet. Plus, they were actually looking at the person they were talking to—just not directly, which could just mean they're shy or thoughtful, not deceptive.  

I keep going back and forth because the absence of obvious tells (like fidgeting or forced smiles) makes it hard to pin down. Maybe they're just a naturally awkward person who avoids eye contact, or maybe they're really good at hiding it. The fact that they didn't seem flustered or rehearsed at all also leans toward truthfulness. But then... why the sideways glances? It's frustrating because it's not clear-cut. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's equally plausible they're just being themselves. Honestly, I'd need more context—like what they were even talking about—to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward "not lying," but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's one of those cases where you just can't tell for sure.

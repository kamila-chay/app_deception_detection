Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm while speaking—they're maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels intentional, and there's a small, consistent smile on their face. They also keep glancing upward a bit, like they're thinking or recalling something, and they don't seem to fidget or avoid looking at the camera. Those things usually make me lean toward them being truthful because when people are lying, they often avoid eye contact, look away more frequently, or show nervous habits like touching their face or fidgeting with their hands. Here, they're not doing any of that. The smile especially feels natural, not forced—like they're genuinely engaged in the conversation.

But I'm not 100% sure, because sometimes people smile even when they're lying, especially if they're trying to seem friendly or relaxed. And that upward gaze... I've heard some people say looking up can be a sign of deception in certain contexts, though I think that's more of a myth. It might just mean they're thinking hard about what they're saying, which could happen whether they're telling the truth or not. Also, maybe they're just naturally expressive or rehearsed their lines, so the calmness isn't necessarily a sign of honesty. I've seen people who are very good at hiding lies, so the absence of obvious nervousness doesn't *prove* they're truthful—it just makes me less suspicious.

Honestly, the more I watch, the more it feels like they're being genuine. No red flags like darting eyes or awkward pauses, and the eye contact feels steady. But I can't rule out the possibility that they're just a really good performer. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. It's just hard to say for certain based on body language alone.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. I see the person smiling a bit (lip corners up), which is interesting because they're not laughing, which feels a bit off—like maybe they're forcing it to seem calm. Their eyebrows are raised quite a bit, and they keep moving their chin up slightly, almost like they're trying to hold themselves steady or push something away. I also noticed they're looking at the other person most of the time, but then their eyes flick sideways a few times, like they're checking something else or just not fully engaged. 

At first glance, the smile and the chin thing make me lean toward deception—people often smile when they're trying to seem friendly while hiding something, and that chin movement feels like a nervous habit I've seen before in tense situations. The raised eyebrows could also be surprise, but it seems a bit too consistent for that. 

But wait—maybe I'm overthinking it. Smiling could just be them being polite or genuinely responding to something, and the sideways glances might just mean they're thinking hard or are naturally fidgety. I've known people who always look away when they're concentrating, not lying. The raised eyebrows might just be a reaction to a question they found unexpected, not deceptive. And the chin moving up... honestly, I've seen that in people who are just tired or just trying to keep their posture, not necessarily lying. 

I'm not 100% sure, but the combination of the forced smile, the chin movement, and those little sideways glances feels like it adds up more to deception than coincidence. It's not screaming "liar," but it's enough that I'd be suspicious if I was the one asking the questions. Still, it could easily be just them being a little stressed or awkward. It's hard to say for sure without more context—like what they were actually talking about. But based on what I saw, I'd guess they're probably not telling the whole truth, though I wouldn't bet my life on it.

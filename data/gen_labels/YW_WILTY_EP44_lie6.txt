It's a bit difficult to be certain just from observing, but there are some signals that make me lean toward the idea that the person might be deceiving. The slight smile, with the corners of the lips turned up but without any genuine laughter, comes across as somewhat forced, as if they're trying to appear calm. Their eyebrows are raised quite noticeably and stay that way consistently, which feels a bit unusual—perhaps an attempt to mask surprise or discomfort. The subtle, repeated upward movements of the chin also suggest some kind of tension or nervousness, rather than a natural posture adjustment. 

They mostly maintain eye contact with the other person, yet their eyes occasionally flick sideways, which could indicate distraction or an attempt to avoid direct engagement. While these cues could have innocent explanations—like politeness, thoughtfulness, or fatigue—the overall combination seems to point more toward concealment than sincerity. 

I'm not entirely convinced they're lying, and some of these behaviors might just reflect stress or awkwardness. However, taken together—the controlled smile, the persistent raised eyebrows, the chin movements, and the side glances—they raise enough suspicion that I would lean toward the conclusion that the person is probably not being fully truthful. It's not definitive, but I find the signs more suggestive of deception than genuine openness.

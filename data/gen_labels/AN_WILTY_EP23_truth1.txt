Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're consistently looking at the person they're talking to—like they're actually listening and not avoiding eye contact, which sometimes happens when people are nervous or lying. Their head stays up straight, and they don't seem to be fidgeting or touching themselves at all, which is interesting because a lot of people do those things when they're stressed or trying to hide something. They also don't smile or make any exaggerated facial expressions, which makes it feel... steady, I guess? Like they're just speaking plainly without trying to sell anything.  

But honestly, I'm not 100% sure. I mean, some people are just naturally calm, right? Like, maybe they're used to being in front of cameras or they've rehearsed this so much that they don't show any of the usual "lie signs." And that occasional glance down—could that be them thinking about what to say next, or maybe they're just uncomfortable? It doesn't scream "lying" to me, but it's not a perfect red flag either. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any visible tells, so just because they're not doing the "obvious" nervous stuff doesn't *prove* they're being honest.  

Still, the fact that they're holding eye contact consistently while staying still feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. If they were making it up, I'd expect at least a little hesitation or a shift in their posture, but they seem relaxed. It's not a slam-dunk, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. Though I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying too—sometimes the content gives it away, even if the body language looks fine. Yeah, I think they're probably being truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just... feels like they're in their head, not their body.

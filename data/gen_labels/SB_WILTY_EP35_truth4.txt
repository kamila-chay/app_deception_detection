Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the behavior. They seem to be smiling a little—like, just the corners of their mouth up, not a big grin—and they're mostly looking at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like someone trying to be honest. But then, they keep covering their mouth with their hand, like they're trying to hold something back, and they also glance sideways a few times while talking. That sideways look makes me wonder if they're thinking about what to say next, which could be a sign they're not being straightforward.  

On the other hand, they don't seem overly nervous in other ways—no frowning, no frantic blinking, no laughing like they're trying too hard to seem calm. The smile they have feels kind of natural, not forced, and they're not avoiding eye contact completely, which sometimes happens when people lie. Maybe they're just a bit anxious about the conversation, and the hand covering is just them fidgeting, not lying. Like, I've done that myself when I'm trying to think of the right words, even when I'm telling the truth.  

The sideways glance could also mean they're recalling something, not fabricating it. And the fact that they're touching their head or face gently—like, not aggressively—makes me think it's more about discomfort than deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs, like a tighter smile or avoiding eye contact altogether. But here, it's all pretty subtle.  

Honestly, I'm not sure. The mouth-covering is the biggest thing that makes me lean toward "maybe not truthful," but the rest of their behavior feels too calm for someone actively lying. It could just be them being a little shy or stressed about the situation. I'd say it's probably truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there are too many ways this could go either way. If I had to guess, I'd say they're being honest, but I'd want more context to feel confident.

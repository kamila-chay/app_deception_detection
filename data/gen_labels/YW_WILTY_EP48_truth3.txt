Looking at the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn on this one. The person's behavior is pretty subtle, so I don't feel super confident either way. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no looking away or avoiding gaze, which usually leans toward truthfulness in my experience. They also have this little head shake, but it doesn't feel aggressive or dismissive; more like a hesitant "I'm not sure" or just a nervous tic, not a clear "no." Their eyebrows are raised and furrowed at the same time, which is weird—it's like they're processing something hard or feeling conflicted, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're trying to remember details honestly, not when they're fabricating.

But then, the head shake *is* a bit of a red flag for me. People often shake their heads when they're denying something, even if it's unconscious. And the furrowed brows could just as easily mean they're stressed about the situation, not that they're lying. I keep wondering if they're just really anxious about being on camera, which would explain the tension without any deception. Also, they're not doing any of the classic "lying" stuff—no fake smiles, no lip biting, no awkward pauses. That makes me lean away from "lying," but it's not a guarantee. Sometimes people who lie are *too* calm, so the lack of stress cues could actually be suspicious too. Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think the head shake might just be a habit or an involuntary reaction to the question, not a deliberate sign of deception. I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure—maybe 60-40 truth? It's just so quiet and low-key, it feels more like someone being genuinely thoughtful than someone trying to cover up. But yeah, I could easily be wrong. It's hard to tell without more context.

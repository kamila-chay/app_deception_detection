Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful here. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't super obvious. On one hand, they're keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—like they're not avoiding looking at you. They're also nodding along while they speak, which seems natural for someone engaged in conversation, not something I'd immediately associate with lying. And their arms are open, not crossed or closed off, which often reads as approachable or sincere. Those things make me lean a little toward them being truthful, especially since they're not showing any of the classic "nervous" signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or over-smiling.  

But then there's that chin thing—kind of a back-and-forth up-and-down motion while they're talking. I've heard some people say that can be a subtle sign of stress or trying too hard to seem calm when lying, but honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It could just be a habit they have while thinking, like how some people tap their fingers or tilt their head. I mean, I've seen people do similar things when they're just being thoughtful, not necessarily deceptive. And since they're not doing anything else weird—no exaggerated expressions, no awkward pauses, no lip-biting—it's hard to say if that chin movement is meaningful or just part of their normal way of speaking.  

The other thing is, I don't know the context of what they're saying. If they're talking about something really sensitive, even a truthful person might act a bit tense, right? Like, if they were explaining a mistake they made, they might not seem as relaxed, but that doesn't mean they're lying. So I guess I'm stuck between "this feels like normal conversation" and "maybe that chin thing is a tiny red flag." I'd probably say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth based on the openness and eye contact, but I wouldn't bet on it. There's just not enough clear deception cues here to feel confident either way. It's one of those cases where you'd want to hear the actual words to be sure, not just watch the body language.

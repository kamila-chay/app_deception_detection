Watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. They maintain eye contact, which often suggests honesty, but that could also be a deliberate effort to appear truthful. The awkward pause and hesitation in their speech stand out more strongly; those breaks are commonly associated with someone fabricating information or struggling to keep their story straight. Their raised eyebrows, which could signal surprise, might also indicate nervousness, as if they're uncomfortable with the question or hiding something.

While their palms are open and they tilt their head—both signals that can imply openness or curiosity—these gestures might also be part of a strategy to appear sincere and deflect suspicion. The subtle smile doesn't feel overly friendly or warm enough to completely dispel doubts; it could be a controlled expression meant to mask discomfort. It's possible the person is just anxious, which can cause similar behaviors, but the combination of hesitation, eyebrow raises, and the general demeanor suggests they're less likely to be fully truthful. 

Without more context, I can’t say definitively, but based on these cues, I tend to think there’s a good chance they’re holding something back or not telling the whole truth. The evidence isn't conclusive, but the signs nudge me more toward deception than honesty.

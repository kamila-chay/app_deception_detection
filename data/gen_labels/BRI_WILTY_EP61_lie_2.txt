Watching the clip, I'm kind of torn. The person seems to be maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to, which feels like it could be a sign of honesty—like they're trying to be direct. But then there's this awkward pause where they keep their mouth closed, like they're struggling to find words or hesitating. That's the part that sticks out to me; when people are lying, they often have those little breaks in their speech, especially if they're fabricating something. They also raised their eyebrows a few times, which I've noticed can happen when someone's trying to seem surprised or caught off guard—maybe they're nervous about the question.

But here's where I get confused: their palms are up, which usually reads as open and genuine, like they're being transparent. And they're tilting their head a bit while they talk—sometimes that's just curiosity, like they're listening carefully, not necessarily deception. I mean, people do that all the time when they're trying to understand something, even when they're telling the truth. The smile they have is pretty subtle too, not a big grin, so it doesn't feel like they're trying to be overly friendly to cover something up. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the awkward pauses might make sense—they're mentally constructing the lie and it's causing hesitation. But I keep thinking, maybe they're just stressed about the situation? Like, maybe they're not lying, but they're genuinely anxious about answering, so their speech gets choppy. The head tilt could be part of that nervous energy too. I've seen people do all these things when they're just trying hard to be honest, not when they're hiding something. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The cues aren't screaming "liar" or "truth-teller"—they're kind of mixed. The pauses and the slight smile make me lean toward deception, but the open palms and steady eye contact keep me from being sure. I'd want more context, like what the question was about or how they usually act. Without that, I'm just going by body language, which is tricky because so many things can look similar. Maybe they're just a bit flustered, not deceptive. But yeah, I'm leaning a little more toward them not being entirely truthful, though I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's one of those moments where it feels like they're holding back something.

Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. Watching the clip, the person seems pretty calm at first glance—no fake smiles or forced laughter, which is good. But I kept noticing they were blinking way more than usual, almost like they were trying not to make eye contact. That’s a bit of a red flag for me because people often blink faster when they’re stressed or covering something up. Their chin was also moving down a lot, like they were tensing their jaw, and their eyes kept drifting downward instead of staying on the person they were talking to. That kind of gaze avoidance can feel like they’re avoiding truth, especially if they’re nervous.  

But here’s where I second-guess myself: their arms were wide open the whole time, which usually signals openness or honesty, not deception. And they didn’t seem to be fidgeting—no hands rubbing or covering their face, which often happens when people are lying. Their head was nodding a bit too, like they were genuinely engaged, not just trying to bluff. I’ve seen people blink a lot when they’re just tired or have dry eyes, and maybe the downward gaze was just them thinking hard, not hiding something.  

The thing that sticks with me is the combination—those nervous little tics (blinking, chin tension) mixed with calm, open body language. If they were lying, I’d expect more contradictions, like a smile that doesn’t reach their eyes or fidgeting. But since they didn’t do any of that, it’s making me lean toward them being honest. Still, I can’t rule out that the blinking was just nerves from the situation, not lying. Honestly? Hard to say for sure without hearing what they’re actually saying. My gut says truth, but I’d want to hear the context to feel more confident.

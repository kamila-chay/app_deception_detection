Looking at the video, I'd say it's really hard to tell for sure, but I'm leaning toward them being truthful—not because they seem super relaxed, but because their behavior doesn't match what I'd expect from someone lying. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to be sincere, not avoiding it. Their head's tilted and turned a bit sideways like they're engaged in the conversation, not faking it. And even though they're blinking a lot, that's super common when people are just nervous or thinking, not necessarily lying—I've done that myself while trying to answer a tough question honestly.  

But here's where it gets tricky: their lips are pulled down at the corners, and they're sticking their lips out a bit, which does look like they're stressed or frustrated. If I were guessing, I'd wonder if they're upset about the topic they're discussing, not that they're lying. Like, maybe they're recalling something painful and that's why their face looks tense. The chin moving down a little could just be them focusing hard, not hiding something.  

On the flip side, you could argue that the lip movements and frequent blinking *do* seem off—like they're trying too hard to control their expression. But honestly, I don't see any classic "lying" tells: no fake smiles, no frowning, no avoiding eye contact, no hands covering their mouth or nervous gestures. People often think liars look away or fidget, but this person seems pretty still otherwise. The fact that they're not doing those things makes me doubt it's a lie.  

Honestly? I think the stress they're showing is probably from the situation itself—like they're telling a hard truth, not making one up. But I'm not 100% sure. If I had to bet, I'd say truth, but it's really close. It could also just be their natural way of talking when they're serious, and I'm overthinking the lip thing. Either way, I don't feel like they're actively deceiving anyone.

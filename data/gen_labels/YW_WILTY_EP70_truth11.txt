Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. They're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to pretty steadily, which feels genuine—people often avoid eye contact when they're lying, but here they're actually looking at the other person most of the time. There's also this moment where they glance down a few times, but it doesn't seem nervous or forced; it almost looks like they're thinking or recalling something, which makes sense if they're being truthful and trying to remember details. 

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Some folks might interpret the downward gaze as a sign of deception—like they're avoiding the truth—but I've read that looking down can also just mean someone's concentrating or being thoughtful, especially in cultures where direct eye contact isn't the norm. And honestly, they don't seem stressed at all: no fidgeting, no weird facial expressions, no over-the-top gestures. If they were lying, I'd expect some of those little tells—like nervous blinking or touching their face—but there's nothing like that here. 

The thing is, though, the absence of "lie signs" doesn't *prove* they're truthful either. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe the question they're answering isn't something that would make them nervous. I'd want to know more context—like what exactly they're being asked about—to feel more confident. But based on the behavior alone, the lack of stress cues and the consistent eye contact with the other person makes me think they're being honest. Still, I'm not ruling out the possibility they're just very calm under pressure. It's tricky, but yeah, I'd probably say truth.

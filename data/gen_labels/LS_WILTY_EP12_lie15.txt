Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. From what I can see, they're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time—which feels a bit unusual if they're lying, since people often avoid direct gaze when deceptive. But then they keep glancing down occasionally, which *can* be a sign of discomfort or trying to recall something, and that makes me pause. They also have this slight upward chin movement—like they're holding their head up a bit stiffly—and a subtle smile where the corners of their mouth lift but it doesn't really reach their eyes. That smile feels a little forced, honestly, like they're trying to seem pleasant but it's not quite natural. 

On the other hand, they're tilting their head while talking, which usually means they're engaged or curious, not necessarily lying. And they don't seem fidgety at all—no rubbing hands, no awkward pauses, no blinking like crazy. If they were really nervous about lying, I'd expect more of those classic signs. Maybe they're just naturally a bit stiff when speaking, or maybe they're genuinely trying to be polite while answering something they're not super comfortable with. The gaze down could also just mean they're thinking carefully, not hiding something. 

I'm leaning slightly toward them being truthful because the lack of other red flags (like fidgeting or obvious avoidance) feels more consistent with someone being honest but maybe a bit reserved. But I can totally see why someone else might think they're lying—especially that chin movement and the slight smile, which *do* sometimes show up in deceptive behavior when someone's trying too hard to seem calm. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're talking about. If it's a casual conversation, I'd probably trust them more. If it's about something sensitive, the gaze down might tip me toward deception. But based *just* on the video, I'm not 100% sure—these cues are just... ambiguous. I'd need to hear the actual words or see more of the situation to feel confident.

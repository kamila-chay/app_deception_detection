Watching this clip, I'm kind of torn. On one hand, the person's frowning a bit and glancing sideways a few times while they talk—it feels like they're not fully engaged, which sometimes happens when people are trying to hold back or think of a response. The sideways glances especially made me pause, because I've noticed in other videos that when people avoid direct eye contact like that, it can signal they're not being 100% honest. Plus, they're nodding and keeping their arms open, which usually reads as calm or open, but maybe that's just them trying to seem relaxed while they're actually stressed.  

But then again, I'm not sure. They're still looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, and the way they nod feels natural—not like they're overcompensating. The open arms also seem genuine, not forced, which makes me wonder if they're just nervous about the topic, not lying. Like, maybe it's a personal question that's making them uncomfortable, so the frown is just from being upset, not deception. I've seen people get that way when they're being truthful but upset about something.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The sideways glances and frown lean toward deception, but the other cues don't fully back it up. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward them being a little off-kilter—maybe not outright lying, but not 100% at ease either. But I could easily be wrong; sometimes people just have a bad day or are naturally expressive. I wouldn't bet the farm on it either way.

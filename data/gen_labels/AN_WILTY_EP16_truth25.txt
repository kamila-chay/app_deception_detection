Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the video, but here's how I'm leaning after watching it. The person's behavior doesn't scream "lying" to me—actually, it feels more like they're just processing something or maybe a bit caught off guard. Like, their eyebrows are raised and their eyes are really wide open, which usually happens when someone's surprised or trying to emphasize a point, not when they're faking something. I've seen people do that when they're genuinely thinking through a question or reacting to something unexpected. And the way they're looking sideways instead of at the person they're talking to? That could just be how they think—like they're mentally gathering their thoughts, not avoiding eye contact to hide something.  

But I get why someone might think they're lying, too. If you're used to thinking "no eye contact = lying," the sideways gaze might raise a red flag. And the exaggerated eye opening could feel like they're overdoing it to seem sincere, like they're trying too hard to convince you. I've noticed people do that when they're nervous, which *could* be a sign of lying, but it's not a sure thing.  

What really makes me lean toward truth, though, is how *little* other nervousness there is. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or frowns—just those few natural reactions. If they were making it up, I'd expect more of those classic "tells," like touching their face or shifting around. The fact that their behavior feels mostly calm and focused (even if the gaze is sideways) makes me think they're just being themselves, not trying to pull something.  

Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's possible they're lying and just really good at staying calm, or maybe the sideways look is a coincidence. But based on what I'm seeing—no obvious stress cues, just some genuine surprise reactions—I'm probably more inclined to believe them than not. It's not 100%, but it feels like the more likely read.

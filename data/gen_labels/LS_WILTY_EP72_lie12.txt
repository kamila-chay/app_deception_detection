Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's really hard to tell just from body language alone, especially without knowing what they're actually saying. From what I'm seeing, they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is interesting because some people avoid eye contact when they're lying, but others do it to seem more convincing. They also have their head moving backward a bit, like they're pulling away slightly, and they're shaking their head—kind of a subtle "no" motion while they're speaking. Their eyebrows are raised too, which often happens when someone's surprised or trying to seem sincere, but it could also be nervousness.  

On the one hand, those head movements and raised eyebrows do feel a little off for someone being completely relaxed. If they were telling the truth, I'd expect them to seem more at ease, maybe with fewer shifts in posture or less deliberate head shaking. The fact that they're maintaining eye contact while doing that *could* be a sign they're rehearsing or trying to seem honest, which sometimes happens when people are lying.  

But then again, I've seen a lot of people raise their eyebrows naturally when they're thinking or responding to a question, even when they're being truthful. And head shaking isn't always a lie—it could just be a reflexive gesture, like they're disagreeing with their own thoughts or emphasizing a point. They're not fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or doing anything super obvious like covering their mouth, which are things I'd expect if they were nervous about lying. If they were being deceptive, I might expect more signs of discomfort, like shifting in their seat or touching their face, but they're pretty still otherwise.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The behavior *could* fit a lie, but it also fits someone who's just being a little cautious or thoughtful while answering. Without knowing the context—like what they're being asked or how they're phrasing their words—it's almost impossible to be sure. I'd lean slightly toward them not lying, just because the eye contact and lack of other "tells" feel more consistent with someone being genuine, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's one of those cases where you'd need to hear the actual conversation to feel confident.

Hmm, I'm not totally sure, but I've been watching this clip a few times and I'm leaning toward them being deceptive, though I'm really not certain. What stood out to me was how often they'd raise their eyebrows—like, pretty consistently throughout the conversation, almost like they were trying to look extra innocent or surprised. I've read that sometimes when people lie, they do that unconsciously as a way to mask their emotions, but I know it's not a hard rule. Then there was that moment where they kept leaning their head forward slightly, like they were really trying to engage with the other person. It felt a bit forced, like they were overcompensating to seem sincere. 

But here's why I'm hesitating: they never looked away—they kept steady eye contact the whole time, and that's usually what people associate with honesty. I mean, I've seen a lot of "truth-telling" examples where people maintain eye contact, so that part feels like it's pulling the other way. Also, their face was pretty neutral—no fake smiles or frowns, which sometimes happens when people are being truthful and not trying too hard. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're just really focused on the conversation. I don't know if that head movement was nervous energy or just them being attentive. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The eyebrow thing makes me lean toward deception, but the eye contact is giving me second thoughts. If I had to guess without knowing anything else, I'd say maybe deception, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context—like, what were they even talking about?—to be sure. I guess I'm just not seeing clear signs of it, but I also don't feel completely convinced they're being honest either. It's weird how one little thing can make you second-guess everything.

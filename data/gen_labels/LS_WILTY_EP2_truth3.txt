Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly? It's a bit of a toss-up, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. Let me explain why I'm not 100% sure though.

First, the eye contact—gaze directly toward the person asking the question. That feels significant. When people lie, they often avoid eye contact, especially if they're nervous, but this person is holding it pretty steady. They're not looking away or down like someone might if they're trying to fabricate something. And they're nodding, which usually matches agreement or understanding—like they're genuinely processing the question, not just trying to buy time.

But then there's the frown—lip corners down, and that slight chin lift. It doesn't look like a full scowl, more like they're concentrating or maybe a bit frustrated with the question itself. I've seen people frown when they're trying to recall something accurately, not when they're lying. Still, it's a bit off-putting. And the arms folded with the shrug... that's the part that makes me pause. Folding arms can be defensive, but the shrug feels more like "I don't know" or "I'm not sure," which might just mean they're being honest about not having the answer, not that they're hiding something. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous tells—like hands fidgeting, or avoiding eye contact even more. But they're not doing that. No frequent blinking, no covering their mouth, no exaggerated gestures. Those are classic signs of deception people often show, and they're missing here.

On the flip side, though, maybe they're just naturally expressive. Some people frown when they think, or fold their arms when they're calm but serious. The chin moving up could just be a habit, like how some people lift their chin when they're speaking firmly. And the shrug—maybe they're genuinely confused about the question, not lying. I've seen truth-tellers shrug when they're trying to be clear. 

I guess the thing that tips me toward truth is the *combination* of steady eye contact, nodding, and the *absence* of the usual nervous tells. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those little fidgets or evasions. The frown and posture feel more like they're processing something hard, not constructing a story. But I'm not ruling out that they could be a really good liar who doesn't show the classic signs. It's possible they're just naturally like that. Still, based on what I saw, I'd say it's more likely they're being honest. I'd be cautious, but I don't see strong evidence of deception here.

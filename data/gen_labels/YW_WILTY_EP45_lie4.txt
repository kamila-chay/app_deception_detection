After watching this clip several times, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. At first glance, they seem engaged—they make eye contact and nod along, which usually suggests sincerity. However, the repeated eyebrow raising feels a bit exaggerated, almost as if they're trying too hard to appear attentive. The frequent blinking stands out as well; since blinking can be a sign of stress or discomfort, it raises some doubts about their honesty.

The conflicting body language is particularly telling. They nod "yes" but simultaneously shake their head "no," which is confusing and may indicate a subconscious attempt to contradict their words. Although the palms-up gesture typically signals openness, it can also be a strategic move to appear trustworthy when they're actually not. While some signs—like the relaxed smile and eye contact—could point toward truthfulness, the inconsistent signals, especially the head shaking coupled with nodding, seem to suggest otherwise.

It's possible that nervousness or habit is influencing their behavior, and sometimes people do display increased eyebrow movement or sideways glances when thinking rather than being deceptive. Also, the blinking could have other explanations like tiredness. Still, these cues combined make me lean more toward the suspicion that they might be withholding the truth. Without more context, I can't be certain, but the mixed signals do make me somewhat doubtful of their honesty.

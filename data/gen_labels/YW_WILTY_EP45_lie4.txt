Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I've been watching this clip a few times and trying to piece together what I'm seeing. The person seems pretty engaged at first—like they're making eye contact with the other person and nodding along, which usually feels like someone who's listening or being sincere. But then there's this thing with their eyebrows: they keep raising them, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem extra attentive, and their eyes are blinking a lot more than usual. I've heard that frequent blinking can sometimes be a sign of stress or discomfort, which people might show when they're not being fully honest.  

Then there's the head shaking and the sideways glance—they're nodding yes but shaking their head "no" at the same time? That feels a bit confusing. It's like they're contradicting themselves physically, which makes me wonder if they're trying to say "yes" but subconsciously signaling "no" because they're lying. The palms-up gesture is interesting too—it's usually seen as open and honest, so that leans toward truthfulness. But I've also read that people sometimes do that when they're trying to *seem* trustworthy, even when they're not.  

On the flip side, maybe they're just nervous or used to fidgeting. I've seen people with a lot of eyebrow movement when they're really focused, not necessarily lying. And the sideways gaze could just mean they're thinking, not hiding something. The lip corners up might be a genuine smile—they seem relaxed in other ways, like the nod and the eye contact. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like frowning or avoiding eye contact completely. But the head shaking and the blinking are nagging at me.  

It's really tricky because these cues don't always mean deception. Maybe they're just tired or have dry eyes, and the blinking's a coincidence. Or maybe they're being truthful but stressed about the topic. I'd lean toward deception because of the mismatched signals—like the head shaking while nodding—but I'm not confident at all. Honestly, without knowing the context or what they're talking about, it's hard to say. I'd say it's a maybe, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

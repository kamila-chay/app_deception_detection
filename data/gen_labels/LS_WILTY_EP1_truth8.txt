Hmm, looking at this clip, it's honestly a bit tricky to call. On one hand, the person seems pretty relaxed—like, they've got a genuine smile going (lip corners up, no frowning or scowling), and their arms are open, which usually feels like someone who's not hiding anything. They're also making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to, even if their head is tilted a bit sideways—sometimes people do that when they're listening or thinking, not necessarily avoiding eye contact. The fact that they're not fidgeting, no nervous blinking, and their mouth is closed with natural pauses instead of looking super strained... that all leans toward them being honest. Like, when people lie, I often see more "tells" like touching their face, avoiding eyes, or forced smiles—but here, the smile looks soft, and they're not covering their mouth or anything.  

But I can see why someone might question it. That "mouth closed (awkward pauses)" thing... sometimes people pause when they're lying, trying to think of the next part. And the sideways gaze could look like they're not fully engaged, though it's also possible they're just naturally shifting their head while listening. I've noticed even truthful people do that when they're processing something. Also, the lips retracted (pulling back a bit) with the smile—that might seem a little odd at first, but it's not like a fake grin where lips are stretched tight; it feels more like a comfortable, real smile.  

Honestly, the cues here are mostly "truthy," but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. People lie in all sorts of ways—some are super calm, and this person seems calm. The lack of classic "lie" signals (like hands fidgeting or avoiding gaze) makes me lean toward truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's the kind of thing where if I heard the words they're saying, it might feel clearer, but just watching the body language... yeah, it feels more like someone being honest than someone trying to hide something. I'd say truth, but I'd still want to hear the actual content before I'd feel totally confident.

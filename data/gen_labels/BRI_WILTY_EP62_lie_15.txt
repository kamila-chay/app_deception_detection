Watching the clip, I’m honestly not 100% sure if they’re lying or not. On first glance, they seem really calm—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no weird eye movements or facial tics. They’re making steady eye contact, answering directly, and their posture is relaxed. If I were guessing based on typical "lying" cues, this feels more like someone who’s telling the truth because they’re not showing the usual signs of stress or evasion. Like, most people who are hiding something might blink a lot, avoid eye contact, or seem tense, but here? Nothing. Just a steady, neutral presence.  

But then I think, *wait, maybe that’s the problem*. I’ve heard some people are really good at lying without showing anything—like they’ve practiced so much they don’t even get nervous. If they’re being deceptive, they might be so controlled that the lack of tells is actually the *sign* of deception. Like, if they were lying, they’d have to work hard to seem normal, and that could look unnaturally calm. So the fact that they’re *too* composed might be suspicious, not reassuring.  

Also, it’s possible they’re just naturally calm or in a situation where they’re not stressed—like if they’re rehearsed or genuinely not worried about the topic. Truth-tellers can be relaxed too, right? I mean, if I’m answering a simple question about my day, I wouldn’t be fidgeting either. So the absence of "deception" cues doesn’t *prove* they’re honest—it just means I’m not seeing the red flags I’d expect.  

Honestly, I’m stuck between two ideas. If I had to lean, I’d say it feels more like truth-telling because the behavior matches what I’d expect from someone comfortable with what they’re saying. But I’d be hesitant to say for sure because deception is tricky—some liars are masters at hiding it. I’d want to hear more context or see if their story holds up under follow-up questions. Without that, I’d just shrug and say, "Hard to tell, but the video doesn’t scream 'liar' to me."

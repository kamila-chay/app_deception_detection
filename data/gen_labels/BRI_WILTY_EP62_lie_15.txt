Watching the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might actually be lying, though I can’t say for sure. At first, they appear very calm—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no unusual eye movements or facial ticks. They maintain steady eye contact, respond directly, and hold a relaxed posture. These are typically signs that suggest honesty since there’s no obvious stress or evasiveness.

However, that very calmness could be a red flag. Some people are skilled liars who manage to control their behavior so well that they don’t display the normal signs of nervousness. In fact, their composure might seem almost too perfect, as if they’re deliberately presenting an image of calm to mask deception. It feels possible that this unnatural steadiness could actually be a sign that they’re trying hard to appear credible, which makes me suspicious.

Of course, it’s also possible that they’re just naturally calm or confident, or maybe they’ve rehearsed their answers. Truth-tellers can be relaxed too, and the absence of classic “lying” cues doesn’t guarantee honesty. Still, given how controlled this person seems, I tend to lean toward thinking there might be some deception involved. Without more information or follow-up questions to test their story, it’s hard to be certain, but overall, my impression is that they could be hiding something rather than being completely truthful.

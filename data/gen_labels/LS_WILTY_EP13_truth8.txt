Hmm, this is tricky. From what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty tense—like they're really focused on whatever they're saying, but not in a good way. Their eyebrows are furrowed, and their lips are pulled down with that slight protrusion, like they're holding back frustration or just... uncomfortable. They keep glancing down at the floor instead of looking at whoever's talking to them, and their head's tilted back a bit, almost like they're trying to physically distance themselves from the conversation. It feels like they're bracing for something, which honestly *does* make me think maybe they're not being fully straightforward. But then again... I've seen people act like that when they're just really stressed about a topic, not necessarily lying. Like, if they're explaining something awkward or embarrassing, they might look down and tense up without it being about deception. The fact that they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact *completely* (they're not looking up or sideways, but they're not actively dodging it either) also makes me hesitate. If they were lying, I'd expect more classic signs—like fidgeting, too much blinking, or a forced smile—but they're not doing any of that. It just looks like they're genuinely struggling to say what they're saying, maybe because it's hard to admit something. So yeah, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but the tension is real. It's not like they're relaxed or anything, but that doesn't automatically mean they're lying—it could just mean they're being honest about something they find tough. I'd say it's a maybe, but the lack of "obvious" lying cues makes me think they're probably not lying here. It's just... heavy.

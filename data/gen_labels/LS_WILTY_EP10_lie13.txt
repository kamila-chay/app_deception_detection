Honestly, watching this clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or just really nervous about something. The first thing that stands out is how often they're blinking—like, way more than normal. I've noticed that sometimes when people are stressed or trying to think of something, they blink a lot, but it's also a common sign people associate with deception, so that makes me pause. Then there's the way they're looking around: not at the camera much, glancing down and sideways a lot. That kind of gaze shift feels off to me—it's like they're avoiding direct eye contact, which I've heard is a red flag for lying, but I also know some people just get anxious in interviews or recordings and do that naturally.  

Their head's tilted and turned to the side a few times, which feels a bit like they're trying to seem engaged, but it also makes me wonder if they're uncomfortable. And they keep touching their head or face with their hands—like, brushing their hair or rubbing their temple. That kind of fidgeting often makes me think someone's trying to cover up something, but honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just tired or overthinking, not necessarily lying.  

On the flip side, their arms are open the whole time, which usually feels like someone being relaxed or honest—like they're not hiding anything. If they were lying, I'd expect them to cross their arms or seem closed off, but that's not happening here. And they're not smiling or frowning, which is weirdly neutral for a conversation. Maybe they're just trying to be polite or calm, but it feels a bit forced?  

I guess the biggest tug-of-war for me is the blinking and gaze stuff versus the open arms. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward deception because of the avoidance and fidgeting, but I keep second-guessing because the arms open thing doesn't fit. Like, maybe they're not lying about the *content* but are just really stressed about the situation. It's not clear-cut at all—people can act nervous for all sorts of reasons, and I don't know the context. Honestly, I'd need to see more of the conversation or hear what they're saying to feel confident. Right now, I'm just... not sure. It feels like they might be hiding something, but it could also just be stage fright.

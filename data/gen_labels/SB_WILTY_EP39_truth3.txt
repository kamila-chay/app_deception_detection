Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone, but I'll try to break it down as I'm watching. So the person is talking to someone, and they're definitely looking directly at them the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is true, which feels like a good sign. I've heard that avoiding eye contact is a common sign of lying, so this actually makes me lean toward them being truthful. But then there's that frequent blinking they're doing—way more than normal, like almost constant. I know people often blink more when they're stressed or lying, so that part makes me pause. Like, maybe they're nervous about something, but is it because they're hiding something or just because they're in a bright room or their eyes are dry? 

I'm also noticing they don't have any other obvious signs of deception. No fidgeting, no crossed arms, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or scowling—just steady eye contact and that blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more tells, right? Like, maybe they'd shift in their seat or touch their face, but they're completely still otherwise. That makes me think the blinking might not be about lying—it could just be them concentrating hard on being honest, or maybe they're just tired. 

On the flip side, some people who lie *do* force eye contact to seem sincere, so that steady gaze might not mean much. But combined with no other nervous habits, it feels less like a "liar trying to seem truthful" and more like someone who's just... being themselves while they talk. The blinking's the only thing that sticks out, and honestly, it's not a huge red flag on its own. I've blinked like that when I'm trying to remember a detail, and I wasn't lying. 

So yeah, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I can't say for sure. The eye contact is reassuring, and the lack of other signs is a big plus. The blinking is nagging at me a little, but it's probably not enough to outweigh the rest. Maybe they're just a fast blinker, or the lighting's weird. I'd say it's more likely truthful than not, but I'd want to see more context to be comfortable with that call. It's hard to pin down with just this clip.

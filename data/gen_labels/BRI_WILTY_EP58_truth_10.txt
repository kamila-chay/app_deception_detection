Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd say it's really hard to be 100% sure, but the behavior seems more consistent with someone telling the truth than lying. The person is making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gazing directly at them while also looking up occasionally, which often happens when someone's recalling a memory or thinking carefully. That feels natural, not like they're avoiding eye contact, which is a common sign people associate with lying. They also have a slight head tilt and raised eyebrows, which usually read as curiosity or engagement, not deception. Plus, their hands are just touching their head or face casually—like they might be adjusting their hair or wiping a bit of sweat—without any fidgeting or covering up, which you'd expect if they were nervous about lying.

That said, I wouldn't rule out the possibility they're lying just because it *looks* calm. Some people are really good at hiding it, and the head tilt could be a subtle way to seem thoughtful while they're making something up. Also, the lack of smiles or laughter might seem odd at first, but it could just mean they're in a serious moment or not feeling particularly happy about the topic. I've seen people who lie without any obvious "tells," so absence of those signs doesn't *prove* truthfulness. But combined with the direct eye contact, the natural head movement, and no signs of stress like rapid blinking or covering their mouth, it leans toward them being honest. Honestly, it's tricky—videos can be misleading without context—but based on the cues I see, I'd be tempted to say they're telling the truth. Still, I'd want more to go on before being certain.

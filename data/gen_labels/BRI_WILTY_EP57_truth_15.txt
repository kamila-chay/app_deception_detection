Watching the clip, I'd say the person seems pretty tense but engaged. They're not smiling or laughing, which makes sense if they're talking about something serious, but their eyebrows are both frowning and raised—like they're really concentrating or maybe frustrated. Their mouth is downturned, and their chin's moving up and down a bit, which feels like nervous energy, not the relaxed calm you might expect from someone lying. 

What stands out is how they keep looking directly at the person they're talking to—they're not avoiding eye contact, which often makes me lean toward truth because liars usually glance away. But then they keep darting their eyes sideways too, which *could* be a sign of discomfort or even lying. I'm a bit torn on that. 

On the flip side, they're not doing any classic "lying" stuff: no awkward pauses, no covering their mouth, no fidgeting with hands. They seem to be speaking steadily, and the chin movements might just be them processing what they're saying, not trying to hide something. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those nervous habits—like rubbing hands or looking up a lot. 

Still, I can't rule out truth entirely. Maybe they're genuinely upset about the topic, which would explain the frown, downturned mouth, and the chin movements. People get tense when they're being honest about something hard. The sideways glance might just be them thinking, not deception. 

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The eye contact is reassuring, but that sideways gaze keeps me second-guessing. If I had to guess? I'd lean toward them being truthful, but it's not a slam dunk. It feels like they're just stressed, not trying to pull one over on anyone. But yeah, I could easily be wrong—nervousness looks similar to lying to the untrained eye.

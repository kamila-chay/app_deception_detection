Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm actually a bit torn because the person seems really calm and composed, which makes me lean toward them being truthful—but I know that's not always reliable. They're holding steady eye contact the whole time, looking directly at whoever they're talking to, and they don't seem fidgety or nervous at all. No avoiding gaze, no weird facial expressions, no hand gestures that seem off. If I were just going by common stereotypes about lying—like people avoiding eye contact or fidgeting—I'd probably say they're being honest. But I've learned that's a trap; some people lie really well while keeping eye contact, and others who are truthful might naturally avoid it because they're shy or just not used to being on camera.  

That said, the *absence* of nervous cues here is kind of surprising. If they *were* lying, you'd expect maybe some subtle signs—like a slight hesitation, a forced smile, or even just a little more blinking—but there's nothing like that. Their face is pretty neutral, they're not shifting in their seat, and their voice (from what I can hear) sounds steady. Honestly, the lack of red flags makes me wonder if they're just very calm or maybe even rehearsed. But then again, if they were lying and super practiced, they might *avoid* those signs on purpose.  

I guess the thing that keeps me from being sure is that deception is so hard to spot just by behavior. The video doesn't show *why* they're saying what they're saying—maybe they're just answering a straightforward question about their day, which would explain why they seem relaxed. If it were something high-stakes, like denying a serious accusation, I'd expect more tension. But since it's not clear from the clip, I can't really tell. I'd lean toward "truthful" because of the direct gaze and calmness, but I'd also be cautious—because I've been fooled before by people who looked super sincere while lying. So yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but if I had to guess based on what's visible, I'd say they're probably telling the truth. Still, it's definitely not a slam-dunk.

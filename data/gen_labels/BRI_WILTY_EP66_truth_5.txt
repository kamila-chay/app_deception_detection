Looking at this clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. The person's not smiling or laughing, which sometimes happens when people are being careful, but it's not a sure sign of lying—could just be serious. What stands out to me is that they keep raising their eyebrows and tilting their head while looking sideways, not at the person they're talking to. I've heard people say avoiding eye contact means someone's hiding something, but I also know that truth-tellers often glance away when they're thinking or recalling details, so that might not mean much. 

Then there's the head shaking—it's happening consistently, and it's hard not to wonder if that's a nervous habit or a "no" gesture, but without knowing what they're responding to, it's tricky. Their palms are up, which usually feels open and honest to me, like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything. But I've also seen people do that when they're trying to seem sincere, even if they're lying. The head tilting and side-turning feel like they're processing what they're saying, which again, could be either truth or deception—people do that when they're being thoughtful or when they're fabricating a story. 

On the flip side, they're not frowning, scowling, or doing anything like frequent blinking or covering their mouth, which are things I've heard are more common in liars. If they were really stressed about lying, I'd expect more of those physical tells. The fact that they're not showing obvious signs of anxiety makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not totally convinced. It's possible they're just a calm person who doesn't get flustered easily, or maybe they're used to lying so it doesn't affect them. 

Honestly, the biggest thing keeping me from being sure is the sideways gaze and head shaking—they feel a bit off, but not enough to override the lack of other stress cues. If I had to guess based on just this, I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth, but I'd want to see the full context of the conversation first. Like, what are they even talking about? If it's a simple question they've already thought about, the head movements might just be natural. But if it's something they're making up on the spot, those gestures could be a sign. I'm just not confident enough to call it for sure.

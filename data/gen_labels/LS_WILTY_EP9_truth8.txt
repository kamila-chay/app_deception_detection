Looking at the clip, I'm really trying to figure this out. At first glance, the person has this pretty heavy frown—eyebrows knotted, lips pulled down—and they're not smiling or laughing at all. That actually makes me pause because I've heard people say liars sometimes force smiles, but here they're looking genuinely upset or frustrated. I'm wondering if they're lying about something they're clearly stressed about, or if they're just telling the truth but the topic is making them feel bad.  

Then there's the way they're looking around—sometimes at the person they're talking to, but often glancing sideways and tilting their head. I've read that sideways glances can be a sign of lying, like they're avoiding eye contact to hide something. But the head tilting feels more like they're thinking or trying to process what they're saying, not necessarily being deceptive. And they're not fidgeting or blinking a lot, which are classic "nervous liar" signs. If they were making it up, I'd expect more of that restless energy, but they seem pretty still.  

The other thing that sticks out is the lack of exaggerated expressions—no big eye rolls or mouth movements, which sometimes happen when people are trying too hard to seem convincing. Their face just looks... tired or serious, not performative. Maybe they're not lying; maybe they're just recounting something difficult and that's why they look so down. But honestly, I'm not totally sure. It's easy to misread frowns—they could be angry about the situation, not the story itself. And sideways glances *can* be deceptive, even if they're not super obvious.  

I guess I'm leaning toward truth because the absence of typical "liar tells" (like nervous gestures) feels more telling than the negative expressions. But I'd need more context—like what they're actually saying—to be confident. If this were a real conversation, I'd probably ask for clarification instead of guessing. It's one of those cases where the behavior *looks* suspicious at first, but the lack of the expected "nervous" cues makes me think they might be telling the truth, just in a pretty grim mood. Still, I'd hesitate to say for sure.

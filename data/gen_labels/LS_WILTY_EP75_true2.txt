Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is that they're not making much eye contact—they're looking up, not at the person they're talking to, which I've heard is sometimes a sign of recalling actual memories, not fabricating something. Like when you're trying to remember a detail, you tend to glance upward, right? And their eyebrows are raised—kind of like they're surprised or processing something, which feels more like genuine confusion than someone trying to cover up a lie. 

But then, their lips are retracted, like they're pulling them back a bit, which can sometimes happen when someone's tense or trying to hold back an expression. I've seen that in people who are nervous, which could lean toward lying. However, they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact entirely (they're just looking up, not away), and there's no obvious signs like excessive blinking or shifting around. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "nervous" cues, like touching their face or looking around a lot, but they're pretty still otherwise. 

On the flip side, though, maybe they're just naturally expressive or stressed about the topic, not lying. The raised eyebrows and lip retraction could just be their normal reaction to being asked something unexpected, not deception. And honestly, the gaze up thing is making me lean toward truth—it's one of the few consistent signs I've heard about in lie detection studies, though I know it's not foolproof. 

So yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're actually trying to remember or think through what they're saying, not making it up. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it—people can be really good at hiding tells, or maybe they're just naturally awkward. It's hard to say for sure without more context, but the absence of clear deception signs is making me think they're probably telling the truth.

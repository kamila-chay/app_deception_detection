Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it *feels* like they're being truthful. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually means they're engaged and not avoiding eye contact—that’s a good sign. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which seems more like curiosity or surprise than nervousness, and they have their palms up, which often reads as open or non-threatening. I don’t see any of the classic "tells" like frowning, avoiding gaze, or touching their face—things that usually pop up when someone’s being deceptive.  

That said, I’m not completely ruling out lying. Sometimes people who lie *do* look at you directly to seem sincere, and the raised eyebrows could just be a nervous habit. The gaze down might actually be a sign of discomfort—like they’re thinking hard about what to say, which could mean they’re fabricating something. And palms up isn’t a foolproof sign; I’ve seen people use it on purpose to seem honest, even when they’re not. Plus, without knowing the context—like what they’re talking about or how they usually act—it’s hard to say.  

I guess my gut says it’s more likely truth because the behavior feels calm and consistent with how someone would act when they’re being honest. But I’d need more to go on to be certain. It’s the absence of *clear* deception cues that makes me lean that way, not any strong "yes, they’re truthful" signs. Like, it’s not that they’re *proving* they’re honest—it’s that they’re not doing anything that makes me doubt them. Still, I’d hesitate to call it a slam dunk.

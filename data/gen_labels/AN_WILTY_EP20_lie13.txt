Watching this video, I'm inclined to think that the person might be lying, though I'm not entirely certain. While they maintain consistent eye contact, which is unusual since many liars tend to avoid looking directly at the camera, other subtle cues suggest some level of discomfort. Their small hand movements—rubbing their hands together and occasionally touching their face—could indicate nervousness, which sometimes accompanies dishonesty. Of course, these gestures might also stem from simple fidgetiness or unease about being on camera, not necessarily deception.

They don’t exhibit the classic signs of lying like fake smiles, excessive blinking, or avoiding side glances, but their restless hands stand out enough to raise a slight suspicion. It feels less like blatant lying and more like they might be withholding or concealing something. Still, these indications are subtle and could just as easily be signs of stress or discomfort in the situation. Given the lack of more overt tells, I wouldn't say they're definitely lying, but the hand movements and overall demeanor lean me toward suspecting some level of deception. Without additional context, it’s hard to be sure, but my impression tilts slightly toward the possibility that they’re not fully truthful.

Hmm, so I'm watching this video and trying to figure out if this person is lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's actually kind of surprising since I've heard so many people say liars avoid eye contact. But here they're looking right at the camera, so that's one thing that doesn't fit the typical "deception" script. 

What stands out to me more are those little hand movements. They're rubbing their hands together and touching their head or face a few times—like, not super dramatic, but definitely noticeable. I've seen people do that when they're nervous or trying to calm themselves down, which sometimes happens when someone's not being completely honest. But then again, I've also seen people do that just because they're fidgety or maybe even just adjusting their hair or something. Like, maybe they're just uncomfortable in the room, not necessarily lying about anything. 

The other thing is, they're not doing any of the obvious "lie signs" we often hear about—no fake smiles, no excessive blinking, no avoiding gaze sideways. They're just... sitting there, a bit restless with their hands. That makes me think it's not a full-blown deception, but maybe they're hiding something? Or maybe they're just really stressed about the whole situation. Like, if I were being asked a tough question, I might rub my hands too, even if I was telling the truth. 

I keep going back and forth. On one hand, the hand behaviors feel like they could be nervousness tied to dishonesty. On the other, it's so subtle—no big tells like a scowl or a shaky voice—that it could just be their normal reaction to being on camera. I don't feel super confident either way. If I had to guess, I'd lean a little toward deception because of those hand actions, but I'd definitely want more context—like what they're actually saying or what the situation is. It's not like they're sweating or shifting around a lot; it's just those small, quiet gestures. So yeah, I'm not sure, but I'd say it's possible they're not being entirely truthful, even if it's not super obvious. Like, it's the kind of thing where you'd say, "Hmm, they seem a bit off," but not "Oh, they're definitely lying."

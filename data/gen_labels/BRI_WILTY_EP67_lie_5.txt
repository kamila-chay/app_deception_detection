Judging from the video, there are some subtle cues that make me lean toward the possibility that the person might be lying, though it's not certain. Their frequent eyebrow raises and consistent avoidance of direct eye contact—looking down or sideways—could be interpreted as signs of discomfort or evasion, which sometimes align with deception. While these behaviors can also indicate nervousness or thoughtfulness, the combination here feels a bit off, especially since they’re supposed to be responding directly. The lack of smiling, fidgeting, or other typical nervous gestures might suggest they’re trying to maintain control, which some people do when concealing the truth. On the other hand, it’s possible they’re just naturally reserved or uneasy, and some individuals simply aren’t great at maintaining eye contact under pressure. Without additional context, it’s hard to be definitive, but given the gaze avoidance and facial expressions, I find myself leaning slightly toward the conclusion that there may be some deception involved, though I remain cautious about this interpretation.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone. So, watching the clip, the person's main thing that stands out is they're raising their eyebrows quite a bit—like, consistently, almost like they're surprised or questioning something. And their eyes are mostly looking down or sideways, not at whoever they're talking to. That gaze avoidance feels a bit off to me, especially if they're supposed to be answering a direct question. I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes look away to avoid eye contact, so that *could* be a sign. But then again, I've also seen people look down or sideways when they're just thinking hard about an answer, or maybe they're just nervous in general—not necessarily lying. Like, if I was being asked something I wasn't sure about, I'd probably do the same thing, right? And they're not smiling, laughing, frowning, or doing anything else that usually screams "deception" in my experience—no weird blinking, no lip movements, nothing like that. So it's not like they're fidgeting or making obvious tells.  

It's also possible they're just not very comfortable with the situation, or maybe they're genuinely confused by the question, which would explain the raised eyebrows and the gaze shift. I mean, we all look away when we're trying to remember something or feel awkward. The fact that they're not doing *other* things people often do when lying—like covering their mouth or shifting in their seat—makes me wonder if it's just them being naturally reserved or stressed, not lying. But then, some people are really good at hiding deception, so maybe they're not showing the classic signs because they're practiced. Honestly, without knowing the context—like what the question was or what they're supposed to be saying—it's really hard to be sure. I'd lean a bit toward them not being deceptive just because the behavior seems more like nervousness than a deliberate act, but I'm not at all confident. It could easily be deception masked by calmness, or it could just be someone who's not great at eye contact. I'd need more to go on before I'd feel comfortable saying for sure either way.

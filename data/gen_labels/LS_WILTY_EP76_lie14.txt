Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they don't seem super nervous—like, they're keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually makes me think they're being honest. Most people who lie tend to look away or fidget, but here they're just... looking at the person, no big deal. And they raised their eyebrows once or twice, which I guess could be surprise or just a natural reaction to the question, not necessarily a sign of lying. Like, maybe they were genuinely taken aback by what was asked.

But then again, I've heard that some people who lie actually *try* to hold eye contact to seem sincere, so maybe that's what's happening here. And the eyebrow thing—sometimes when people are putting on a front, they'll raise their brows a little too much to seem "engaged" or "surprised," even if they're not. It’s subtle, though. I mean, they didn't smile, laugh, or look away, which are things I'd expect to see if they were lying. But on the flip side, the fact that they didn't do those "nervous" things could also mean they're really good at hiding it. Like, they might be practiced at this.

I guess I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because of the eye contact and lack of fidgeting, but I'm not totally sure. It’s not like they're sweating or avoiding the question—those are the classic red flags I’d look for. Still, it’s possible they’re just a calm liar, and the eyebrow thing was just a habit. Honestly, without more context, like what they were saying or the situation, it’s hard to tell. I’d say it’s probably truth, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re being honest, but I can see how someone else might think differently.

I'm watching this clip now, and while the person seems calm and straightforward, holding steady eye contact without nervous gestures, that very composure makes me wonder if they might be hiding something. Normally, people who lie show some signs—like fidgeting or awkward pauses—but this person’s smooth speech and neutral expression could just be a practiced, deliberate way to appear trustworthy. It’s possible they’re intentionally maintaining calmness to avoid giving anything away. There aren’t any obvious tells like lip biting or raised eyebrows, but sometimes the absence of such signs, especially paired with unusually steady behavior, can itself be a red flag. Without more context or knowing what they’re saying, it’s hard to be sure, but based on just the behavioral cues, I tend to lean toward the idea that they might be deceiving us, even if it’s not blatantly obvious. The calmness feels a little too controlled, suggesting that they could be putting on a good poker face rather than being completely honest.

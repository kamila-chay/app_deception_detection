I'm watching this clip now, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems really calm and straightforward while they're talking. They're holding steady eye contact with whoever they're speaking to—no looking away, no fidgeting with their hands, nothing like that. They don't seem nervous at all; no quick blinking, no awkward pauses where they're just... stuck with their mouth closed. They're actually speaking smoothly, and their face is pretty neutral—no fake smiles or scowls, just a relaxed expression. That makes me lean toward thinking they're being honest because, you know, most people who lie *do* show some kind of nervous tic or mismatched expression, even if they're trying to hide it.  

But then I keep thinking, *what if they're really good at this?* Like, some people practice keeping eye contact and staying calm when they lie—they might even *want* to look direct to seem trustworthy. I've seen that before, where someone's super composed but you just *know* they're not being straight with you. And honestly, the video doesn't give me *any* clear signs of deception—no raised eyebrows, no lip biting, nothing that screams "this person is lying." So maybe it's just that they're genuinely not hiding anything.  

Still, it's hard to say for sure. Without more context—like what they're saying or the situation—it's easy to misread calmness as truthfulness when it might just be a really good poker face. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to feel more confident, but based on just the behavior... yeah, it feels like they're being truthful. But I'm not gonna claim I *know* it. It's possible they're hiding it well, but the lack of tells makes me think they're probably telling the truth. I'd say it's leaning toward truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

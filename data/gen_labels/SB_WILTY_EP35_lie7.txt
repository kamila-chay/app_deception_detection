Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are a few things that stand out, but they could easily be explained in other ways too. At first glance, they seem pretty engaged with the person they're talking to, like they're maintaining eye contact (gaze towards interlocutor is true), which usually makes me think they're being honest. But then there's this constant, almost nervous blinking—they're doing it way more than usual, like they're really fidgety. I've heard that excessive blinking can be a stress sign, which might happen if they're lying, but it could also just be because the room is bright or they're tired. 

Then there's the head and chin stuff. They're moving their chin up and down a lot, and their head's tilting side-to-side while they're talking, which feels a bit off. When people are stressed or trying to remember something, they sometimes do that, but I've also seen people do it naturally when they're just thinking out loud. And they keep glancing sideways—like, they look directly at the other person, then quickly shift their gaze away. That makes me pause because liars often look away when fabricating a story, but truth-tellers might do it too when recalling details, so it's not a clear sign. 

On the flip side, they're not smiling or laughing, which is interesting. If they were being playful or relaxed, I'd expect more of that, but the absence of those might just mean they're serious or uncomfortable—not necessarily lying. They're also not touching their face or fidgeting with their hands, which some people associate with deception, so that actually leans toward them being calm. 

Honestly, the biggest thing that makes me lean toward "maybe lying" is the combination of the frequent blinking and the sideways glances. It feels like they're trying to stay composed but it's not quite working—like their body's betraying them a little. But I could totally be wrong. Maybe they're just really anxious about the situation, or maybe they're a naturally expressive person who fidgets a lot when they talk. Without knowing what they're saying or the context, it's hard to tell. I'd say it's a maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it either way. If I had to guess, I'd say deception is possible, but it's not definitive.

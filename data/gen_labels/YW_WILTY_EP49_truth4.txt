Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video, honestly. The person's body language seems pretty neutral overall—no obvious signs like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or fake smiles that I'd usually associate with lying. They're actually making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which often suggests openness, and their arms are open, which feels like a natural, relaxed posture—not the kind of stiff, defensive stance I'd expect if they were hiding something. The fact that they're raising their eyebrows a bit while speaking also seems like a genuine reaction to what they're saying, like they're processing or emphasizing something, not a forced "lie sign."  

But then there's the head shaking and the gaze down. I'm not 100% sure what the head shake means here—it could just be a small, unconscious "no" while they're talking, or maybe they're just gesturing naturally while disagreeing with a point they're recalling. And the gaze down... that's a bit confusing because sometimes people look down when they're being truthful (like when they're thinking), but other times it's a sign of discomfort or evasion. I've seen both in real life, so it doesn't really tip the scale for me either way.  

The thing that keeps me leaning toward them telling the truth is the lack of *any* classic deception cues. No lip biting, no rapid blinking, no crossed arms, no awkward pauses—they seem pretty comfortable and engaged. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *one* of those nervous tells to show up, especially if it's a high-stakes moment. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure. I mean, I've known people who lie without blinking, so the absence of those signs doesn't *prove* truthfulness.  

Honestly, I'm split. The open posture and direct eye contact feel like strong indicators of honesty, but the head shake and downcast gaze leave me second-guessing. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just... the video doesn't scream "lie," and it doesn't scream "truth" either—it just feels like a normal, calm conversation. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person who happens to raise their eyebrows a lot. Gotta go with the balance here: the evidence points more toward truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd be certain.

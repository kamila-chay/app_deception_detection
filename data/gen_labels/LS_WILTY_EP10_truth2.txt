Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though it's really tricky. The person's eyes are constantly moving toward the person they're talking to, which feels like genuine engagement, and they're nodding along while their head bobs forward and back like they're processing what's being said. That kind of natural head movement usually happens when someone's listening or agreeing, not when they're making something up. Plus, they're not avoiding eye contact at all, which often gets flagged as a lie sign, but I know that's not always reliable—some people just naturally hold eye contact even when they're being honest.  

But then there's the frequent blinking and the way their lips are pulled down at the corners. Blinking a lot *can* signal stress or discomfort, which people sometimes associate with lying, but it could also just be from the bright lights in the room or them being tired. And the lip corners down... that looks like they're maybe frustrated or just in a neutral, slightly tense mood—not necessarily deceptive. I've seen people do that when they're concentrating on answering a question honestly, not when they're lying.  

The thing that makes me hesitate is the chin moving up and down—like they're subtly tilting it while talking. That can sometimes happen when someone's rehearsing or thinking hard, which *could* hint at fabrication. But honestly, it also feels like a natural part of speaking, like they're emphasizing points without even realizing it. And there's no fidgeting, no hands covering the face, no obvious signs of nervousness like sweating or shifting around—those are usually bigger red flags for lies, but they're absent here.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tell" signs: maybe more blinking, avoiding eye contact, or that stiff "smile" people fake. But they're not doing any of that. Their expression is actually pretty flat—no forced smiles or exaggerated reactions—which feels more like someone being straightforward than someone trying to hide something.  

So yeah, I'm leaning toward truth, but I can't rule out that the blinking is just them being tired, or the lip thing is unrelated. It's easy to overread body language, and I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure. But based on the movements alone? It feels more like they're being genuine than deceptive. I'd say "truth" with some uncertainty, not 100% certainty.

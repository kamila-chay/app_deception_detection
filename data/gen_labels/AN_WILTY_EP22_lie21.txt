Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not 100% sure. The person seems pretty tense. They're scowling the whole time, eyebrows knotted down, and their lips are pulled down at the corners – that's pretty intense. They're also shaking their head side-to-side pretty firmly, and their palms are facing up, open. Honestly, that combination of a frown, head shake, and open palms feels... off. It's not the kind of relaxed body language you'd expect if they were just telling a straightforward story. It almost looks like they're pushing back against something, like they're disagreeing or frustrated.

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're not lying *at all*. Could be they're genuinely upset about what they're being asked or what they're talking about. Like, maybe they're upset about the question itself, or they're just having a bad day, and that's why they're scowling and shaking their head. I've seen people get that defensive when they're just annoyed by the situation, not because they're hiding something. And the fact that they're keeping eye contact (gaze towards the interlocutor) makes me think it's not just them avoiding looking at the person – they're actually engaging with the question, just in a negative way. The palms up could even look like they're trying to seem open or honest, which is the opposite of what you'd expect from someone lying.

Also, they're not doing the classic "lie signs" like blinking a lot or looking away. No awkward pauses, no nervous fidgeting with hands. So it's not like they're acting super guilty. It feels more like they're actively resisting or disagreeing with the topic, not necessarily fabricating a story. Maybe they're telling the truth but are really angry about it? Or maybe the question was phrased in a way that made them defensive.

Honestly, I'd lean toward it being deception just because of the intensity of the negative expressions combined with the head shake – it feels like they're trying to forcefully reject something. But I'm not confident at all. It could easily be just someone who's genuinely frustrated and not lying. Without knowing the context of what they're saying or why they're being asked, it's really hard to tell if that scowl is from guilt or just pure annoyance. I'd say it's possible, but I wouldn't bet on it – it's just one of those things where the body language screams *something* is up, but I'm not sure what.

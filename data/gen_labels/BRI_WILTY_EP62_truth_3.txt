Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out just by watching the clip, and it's a bit tricky. The person is making pretty steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really focused on the other person, not looking away or up. That part feels like it leans toward truthful to me, because when people lie, they often glance around or avoid eye contact, right? But I know that's not a rule—some really practiced liars will lock in eye contact to seem convincing, so I can't just go by that alone.

What's really interesting is how calm they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no touching their face or hands, not even shifting in their seat. They're just sitting there, talking plainly, with their mouth closed like they're thinking carefully about what to say. To me, that stillness feels more like someone being genuinely engaged or thoughtful, not like they're hiding something. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a tiny bit of tension—like a forced smile or a quick head shake—but there's nothing like that here.

But I keep second-guessing myself because... well, the opposite could be true. Maybe they're just really good at faking calm. Like, if they've rehearsed this story a hundred times, they might not show any signs of stress at all. I've seen people do that in interviews or on TV—super composed while lying. And honestly, the lack of any expression at all (no smile, no frown) feels a little off for a natural conversation. If they were telling a true story about something emotional, you'd expect a tiny bit of reaction, even if it's subtle. But maybe this is just a dry, factual statement, and they're naturally quiet.

I guess what makes me lean toward truthful is that the eye contact feels *consistent*—not just a quick glance, but steady and directed. And the total absence of nervous tells is unusual for a liar, though not impossible. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure. Without that context, I'm just going by behavior, and it feels more like someone who's not hiding anything than someone who is. But I'm not 100% certain—I'd say it's a maybe, but leaning toward truthful. Like, if I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

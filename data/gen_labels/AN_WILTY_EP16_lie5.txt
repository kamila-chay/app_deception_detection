Looking at this clip, I'm honestly a bit torn. On one hand, the person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever's asking the question, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. They're also nodding along while they talk, which often suggests agreement or confidence in what they're saying. Those cues alone might make me lean toward thinking they're being truthful.

But then there's this other stuff that's bugging me. They keep raising their eyebrows a lot, almost like they're surprised by their own words, and their hands are constantly fiddling—scratching their head and touching their neck or face. I've seen people do that when they're stressed or trying to hold something back, not just when they're nervous about the situation. It's not like they're shifty-eyed or avoiding contact, but the physical signs feel a bit off for someone who's just relaxed and telling the truth. I've had friends who scratch their neck when they're lying, but I know it can also just mean they're tired or uncomfortable in the room.

The tricky part is that all the "honest" cues—eye contact, nodding—are pretty strong here, which makes me wonder if they're deliberately trying to seem trustworthy. Sometimes people who lie *overdo* the eye contact or nodding to seem credible. But then again, maybe they're just naturally expressive or really into the conversation. The raised eyebrows could just be their normal reaction to the question, not a sign of deception. I mean, I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're thinking hard about an answer, not necessarily when they're lying.

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The scratching and head-touching are the strongest red flags for me, but they're not definitive. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward deception because of those physical tells, but I'd be really hesitant to call it a solid "yes." It could easily be just someone who's naturally fidgety or anxious about being on camera. I'd want to see more context—like the actual question they're answering or their overall demeanor in other parts of the clip—before I'd feel confident either way. Right now, it's a maybe, but the fidgeting makes me lean toward "not entirely truthful."

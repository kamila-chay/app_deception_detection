Watching the clip, I notice the person is frowning—eyebrows pulled down tight—and shaking their head side-to-side in a clear "no" motion. They’re not smiling, laughing, or doing anything like covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands, which I’d usually expect if someone was trying to hide something. The way they’re looking straight ahead while shaking their head feels pretty direct, like they’re just stating a fact they disagree with, not crafting a story.  

But honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. Frowning can mean a lot of things—maybe they’re just annoyed or concentrating hard, not necessarily lying. And head shaking *could* be a nervous tic, especially if they’re stressed about the question. I’ve seen people shake their heads when they’re being truthful but frustrated, like when someone’s being stubborn about a simple answer. On the flip side, if they *were* lying, they might frown because they’re worried about getting caught, but the lack of other tells—no fake smiles, no awkward pauses, no avoiding eye contact—makes me lean away from deception.  

Still, I’m not 100% certain. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive or had a bad morning. But overall, the way they’re reacting feels more like genuine disagreement than the kind of strained performance I’d associate with lying. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re being truthful, but I’d want to see more context—like what the question was—before I’d feel totally confident. It’s the kind of thing where you just have to trust your gut after watching it a few times, and this one feels… honest.

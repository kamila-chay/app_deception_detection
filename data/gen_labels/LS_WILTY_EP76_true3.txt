Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm overall—they're not smiling, laughing, or frowning, and they're not fidgeting with their hands much. The thing that stands out is that they keep their eyes down, like they're looking at the floor or their hands instead of meeting the camera. And they have their hands covering their mouth or face a few times, like they're trying to hide it or maybe just wiping something off. 

Now, if I were trying to guess if they're lying, I'd think about why someone might look down or cover their face. Sometimes people do that when they're nervous or trying to avoid eye contact, which *could* be a sign of lying. But honestly, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking, feeling shy, or even just adjusting their glasses—nothing necessarily deceptive about it. Like, if they're answering a question they're not sure about, they might look down to gather their thoughts, and covering their mouth could just be a habit. 

On the flip side, the *absence* of other classic "lying" cues is interesting. They're not blinking a lot, not shifting around, not nodding too much, and they're not smiling or laughing like they'd be if they were trying to seem friendly while lying. If they were making something up, I'd expect more signs of tension—like tight lips or a shaky voice—but here they seem pretty relaxed. Maybe they're just a naturally quiet person, or maybe they're telling the truth and the downcast eyes are just how they talk. 

I'm not 100% sure, though. It's easy to overread body language, especially with something as subtle as a gaze down. It could be innocent, or it could be a nervous tic. But since they're not doing anything *obviously* off-kilter—like avoiding eye contact *extremely* hard or covering their face *constantly*—I'd lean toward them being truthful. Still, it's not a slam dunk. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to say it for sure. It just feels like they're being genuine, not like they're hiding something.

Hmm, looking at this clip, it's really tricky to call. On one hand, the person keeps raising their eyebrows and blinking a lot—those often make me think someone's stressed or trying to seem convincing, like they're overcompensating. And the lip corners are pulled up a bit, which feels a little forced, not like a natural smile. You'd think someone lying might avoid eye contact, but here they're actually looking right at the other person the whole time, and they're tilting their head like they're genuinely engaged. That part makes me pause because truth-tellers often do that too when they're listening. 

But then again, I've seen people blink like crazy when they're just nervous about the situation, not necessarily lying—maybe they're tired or the lighting's bad. And raised eyebrows? Could just be surprise at the question, not deception. Honestly, the lack of other "classic" signs like fidgeting or avoiding gaze makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to misread these things. If I had to guess without the label, I'd say maybe they're not lying, but I'd want to hear more context before I'd feel confident about it. It just doesn't *feel* like the textbook "lie" I'd expect.

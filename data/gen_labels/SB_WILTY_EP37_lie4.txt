Based on what I'm observing, there are some subtle signs that lean toward the person possibly not being entirely truthful. While they do maintain eye contact and keep their arms open, which generally suggests openness, certain behaviors stand out as somewhat suspect. For instance, the repeated eyebrow raises and the head shaking when denying something come across as potentially exaggerated, almost like they’re trying too hard to convince. This kind of overemphasis can sometimes indicate nervousness or an attempt to mask deception.

At the same time, some gestures, like the head tilting and nodding, can be natural parts of a thoughtful conversation and don’t necessarily point to dishonesty. The absence of classic signs such as fidgeting or avoidance of eye contact also makes it less clear-cut. However, those overly deliberate signals—the eyebrow raises without a clear reason and the forceful "no" with head shakes—raise some doubts. While it’s not definitive, these cues make me lean toward suspecting they might not be fully truthful, even if it’s just a slight deception or omission. More context would definitely help, but right now, the evidence nudges me to be cautious about taking their words at face value.

Based on what I'm seeing here, it's a bit tricky to call. The person seems pretty engaged—looking right at the person they're talking to, nodding along, and keeping their arms open like they're trying to seem approachable. That part makes me lean toward them being genuine, honestly. But then there's that eyebrow raise they do a few times, and the head shaking when they're saying "no" to something—it feels a little... rehearsed? Like they're overdoing the "no" to make it stick. I've seen people do that when they're trying to seem convincing, especially if they're nervous.  

On the flip side, though, the head tilting and the way they're nodding could just be natural conversation stuff—like they're genuinely thinking about what's being said, not necessarily lying. And the fact they don't seem fidgety or avoid eye contact (which is a classic sign people think liars do, but it's not always true) makes me wonder if they're just calm or maybe even a little bored, not deceptive. The arms being open definitely feels like they're trying to project openness, but that could just be their default.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The eyebrow thing nags at me a bit—like, why raise them so much when they're not even surprised? But maybe it's just how they talk. If I had to guess, I'd say *maybe* they're not telling the whole truth, but it's not obvious. It could just be them being extra expressive. I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. Right now, it's one of those "hmm, not sure" moments where the cues aren't screaming "liar" or "truth-teller."

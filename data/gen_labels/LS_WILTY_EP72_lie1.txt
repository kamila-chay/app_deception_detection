Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure, but I'd lean toward thinking they might be being a bit evasive. The way they keep raising their eyebrows while they're talking stands out—like they're surprised or trying to gauge my reaction, which sometimes happens when people are piecing together a story. And that sideways glance while still mostly looking at the person asking the question? That feels a bit off, like they're not fully engaged in the conversation. Plus, the head tilting back slightly and moving backward a bit—almost like they're creating a little space for themselves—seems like a subtle sign of discomfort, which I've noticed before when people are holding back.

But honestly, it's really hard to say for sure. I've seen people with really natural mannerisms do exactly that—raise their eyebrows when they're thinking, or glance sideways when they're trying to recall something. Maybe they're just nervous about being on camera, or maybe they're genuinely processing the question without any ulterior motive. The fact that they're still making eye contact most of the time (gaze toward interlocutor) actually makes me question the deception angle a bit, because liars often avoid direct eye contact more consistently. And there's no forced smile or frowning, which sometimes you see in lies, so that's a bit of a counterpoint.

So yeah, the behavior *could* fit a lie—those head movements and the raised brows feel a bit loaded—but it could just as easily be their normal way of thinking. Without knowing the context of what they're talking about or their usual habits, I'd say it's a maybe. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't rule it out either. It's one of those clips where you just can't tell for sure without more info.

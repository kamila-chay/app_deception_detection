Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. They're making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to—which usually leans toward truthfulness, right? Like, liars often avoid eye contact, so seeing them look straight at the interlocutor feels a little counter to that. But then they're also looking down a lot, which sometimes happens when people are nervous or avoiding scrutiny. I've heard that looking down can be a sign of deception, especially if it's frequent, but it could also just be them being thoughtful or even respectful in their culture. It's hard to pin down.

Then there's the hand thing—touching their head or body, like adjusting their hair or neck. That's a subtle gesture, and some studies link it to stress or discomfort, which might hint at lying. But honestly, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just tired or fidgeting with their clothes, not necessarily because they're hiding something. The rest of their behavior seems pretty neutral: no fake smiles, no awkward pauses, no obvious signs of nervousness like rapid blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tells," but it's not there. That makes me wonder if they're actually telling the truth and just seem a bit distracted.

On the flip side, the gaze down could still be a red flag. Maybe they're lying and using the eye contact to seem credible while secretly avoiding direct engagement with their own guilt. Or maybe they're just bad at controlling their gaze when they're stressed, whether lying or not. I'm also not sure if "gaze towards interlocutor" being true means they're locked in or just occasionally glancing up—without seeing the full clip, it's hard to tell how consistent that eye contact is. 

Honestly, I keep circling back to the fact that deception cues are super messy. People don't always act the way the books say they will, and context matters way more than isolated gestures. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward they're telling the truth—because the lack of strong nervous signs feels more like a calm person than a liar—but I wouldn't bet money on it. The hand touch and gaze down are nagging at me, but they could just be random habits. I'd need to hear the actual conversation or see more of the video to feel confident. For now, I'm just not sure.

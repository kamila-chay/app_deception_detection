Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m leaning somewhat toward the person possibly being deceptive, though it’s not completely clear. They maintain direct eye contact throughout, which can be unusual since people who are lying often avoid eye contact or glance away. However, their consistently raised eyebrows stand out—they could be a sign of stress or an attempt to appear sincere, which might indicate some underlying discomfort with what they’re saying.

On the other hand, they don't show other common signs of lying, like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or forced smiles; they seem calm and steady in their demeanor. This calmness could suggest truthfulness, but it’s also possible that they’re simply skilled at masking their nervousness. The sustained eyebrow raise, especially combined with steady eye contact, feels like it might be an effort to appear honest rather than a natural expression.

Overall, while I can’t say for sure they’re lying, I find the eyebrow behavior enough to raise suspicion that they might be trying to convince rather than genuinely conveying the truth. Without knowing more context or hearing what they’re actually saying, I’m inclined to lean toward deception but with caution—it’s not a definitive conclusion, just a possibility that weighs slightly more heavily than the alternative.

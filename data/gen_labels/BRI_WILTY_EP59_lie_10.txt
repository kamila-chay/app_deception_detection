Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's kind of ambiguous. They're looking directly at the camera the whole time, which feels a bit unusual for someone who might be hiding something, since I've noticed liars often glance away or avoid eye contact. But their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently, which I've heard can sometimes happen when people are trying to seem sincere or are stressed about what they're saying. Like, maybe they're nervous about the question and it's showing in their face without them realizing it. 

On the flip side, though, they're not doing any of the other classic "liar tells" I've seen in videos—no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or forced laughs. They're just sitting there, calm and eye contact steady, with those eyebrows up. That actually makes me lean a little toward them being truthful because if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, and maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows—like, they might do that when they're thinking hard about an answer, not necessarily because they're lying. 

I guess the thing that's throwing me off is that the eyebrow thing. If it was just a quick raise, I'd think it was normal, but it's sustained, and they're not looking away. It's making me wonder if they're trying too hard to seem honest, which sometimes happens when people *are* lying. But I'm not gonna rule out the possibility that they're just a naturally expressive person. Without knowing what they're actually saying or the context, it's really hard to tell. Honestly, I'd say it's probably closer to truthful than deceptive, but I'm not at all confident—there's just not enough clear evidence either way. If I had to guess, I'd say "truthful," but I'd need to see more of the conversation to feel sure.

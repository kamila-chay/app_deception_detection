Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—truth be told, it's a bit of a toss-up. The person isn't smiling or laughing, which might make some people think they're being evasive, but they also don't have those classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or over-the-top gestures. Instead, they've got these raised eyebrows and a slight frown, which honestly feels more like they're confused or trying to process what they're being asked, not like they're hiding something. I've seen people look like that when they're just genuinely thinking through a question, especially if it's unexpected.  

The head shaking is interesting—it's a clear "no" motion, but in the context of the video, it seems more like they're emphasizing a point they're making (like "No, that's not right") rather than nervously denying something. If they were lying, I'd expect them to maybe avoid eye contact more or have more physical tension, but they're not doing any of that. The description says their gaze isn't toward the person, which could lean toward deception for some, but I've also seen people look away while thinking, especially if they're being direct about something they believe is true.  

On the flip side, though, if they *were* lying, they might be really good at hiding it—some people don't show stress cues at all. And the lack of smiles or laughter could just mean they're serious about the topic, not that they're lying. Like, if someone's telling a sad story or explaining something mundane, they wouldn't smile, right? So it's not impossible they're being deceptive, but the absence of clear red flags makes it feel less likely. Honestly, without knowing the actual question they're answering, it's hard to say. To me, it reads more like someone who's just being thoughtful or maybe a little frustrated with the question, not someone who's weaving a story. But I'd be hesitant to call it "truth" for sure—I'd need more context, like what they're saying versus what they're doing. At face value, though, the behavior doesn't scream "liar" to me.

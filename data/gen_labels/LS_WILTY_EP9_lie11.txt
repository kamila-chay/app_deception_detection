Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where the cues kind of point in different directions. On one hand, the way they're moving their head a lot stands out: they're shaking it side to side, tilting it, and even turning it sideways while they're talking. And they're shrugging a lot too, which often feels like someone trying to say "I don't know" or "I'm not sure," which can happen when people are being evasive. Their eyebrows are raised and furrowed at the same time, and their lips are pulled down, which seems tense—like they're not relaxed, maybe even a bit stressed. The exaggerated eye opening makes them look wide-eyed, which sometimes happens when people are trying to seem innocent or surprised, but it could also just be them being animated. 

But then there are things that make me hesitate. They're keeping their gaze directly on the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually feels more like honesty—liars sometimes avoid eye contact, though not always. And they're not smiling or laughing, which is interesting because I've heard some people say liars try to smile more to seem friendly, so the lack of it might actually lean toward truthfulness. The chin moving downward and the head moving forward could also just be natural gestures while they're thinking, not necessarily deception. 

Honestly, the shrugs and head movements are the strongest things that make me lean toward deception, but I keep second-guessing because the direct eye contact and no forced smiles don't fit the classic "liar" profile. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation, not lying. I'd want to see more of the conversation or context to be sure—like what they're actually saying—because these physical cues alone can mean so many different things. I'd say it's possible they're being deceptive, but it's not a clear-cut case, and I wouldn't bet on it without more to go on. It feels like they're trying a little too hard to seem calm, but maybe that's just how they are when they're focused.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I tend to lean toward the idea that they might be lying, although it's not entirely certain. The frequent head movements—shaking side to side, tilting, turning sideways while talking—combined with lots of shrugging suggest a certain evasiveness, as if they're avoiding giving a straightforward answer. Their raised and furrowed eyebrows alongside downturned lips give off an impression of tension or stress rather than relaxation. The wide-eyed expression could be an attempt to appear innocent or surprised, which sometimes arises when someone is trying to convince you of something untrue.

On the other hand, their steady eye contact throughout the conversation is somewhat atypical for someone who is lying, since avoidance of eye contact is often noted in deception, though not always. Also, the absence of smiling or laughter is interesting, as liars sometimes force smiles to come across as friendly and trustworthy, so not smiling might lean toward honesty. The chin moving downward and the head moving forward could simply be natural gestures linked to thinking, not necessarily signs of deceit.

Still, the combination of shrugs and frequent head movements makes me lean more towards deception here, despite the conflicting signs. It's possible they're nervous rather than deliberately dishonest, but the physical cues hint at an effort to mask something. Without more context or the content of what they're actually saying, it's hard to be sure, but overall it feels like they might be trying to convince us of something that isn’t entirely true.

Hmm, I'm trying to figure this out based on what I'm seeing. The person is definitely doing some things that make me pause. They keep covering their face or mouth with their hands a few times, which feels like a classic sign of discomfort or trying to hide something—like when you're nervous about what you're saying. And their chin is moving up and down a lot while they're talking, almost like they're chewing on words or struggling to keep it together. They also glance sideways a few times instead of holding steady eye contact, which I've noticed before can happen when someone's not being fully truthful. 

But then there's the other stuff that makes me second-guess. Their arms are open the whole time, which usually signals openness or honesty, not deception. And they're nodding along while they talk, which feels like they're trying to seem engaged and sincere. I wonder if they're just naturally fidgety—maybe they're tired or just have that habit of touching their face when they're thinking hard. The head tilting and turning also seem more like they're listening or processing than lying. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The hand covering and sideways glances lean toward deception, but the open arms and nodding feel like they're actively trying to seem trustworthy. Maybe they're lying but doing a bad job of it, or maybe they're just really anxious about being on camera and the "signs" are just nervousness, not deception. I can't be sure—it's easy to misread body language, especially when someone's not trying to hide it completely. I'd lean toward deception because of the face covering, but I'd also say it's not a slam dunk. It feels like they're trying to be honest but might be struggling with something.

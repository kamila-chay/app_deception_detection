Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together what's going on with their behavior. They're not smiling or laughing, which I've heard some people think is a sign of lying—but honestly, that's not always the case. Sometimes people just get serious when they're explaining something. What stands out to me is how often they raise their eyebrows, especially when they're talking. It's not a big, exaggerated thing, just a quick lift, like they're genuinely surprised or processing what they're saying. Then there's the nodding—they're definitely nodding along while they speak, which usually feels like agreement or emphasis, not something I'd associate with someone trying to cover up a lie. And the head shaking? They're shaking it side to side a few times, but it's not frantic or aggressive—more like a natural "no" or dismissive gesture, kind of like when you're thinking "yeah, that's not right."  

I keep wondering if that head shaking is a red flag. Sometimes people shake their heads when they're lying because they're subconsciously rejecting the truth, but it could also just be them reacting to what they're saying, like "no, I didn't do that" while they're answering a question. The fact that they're not frowning or squinting or doing anything overly tense makes me lean toward them being genuine—liars often seem more physically stressed, like they're trying too hard to seem calm. But then again, I've seen people who are really good at hiding nerves, so it's not foolproof. The raised eyebrows could also just be a nervous habit, not necessarily a sign of deception.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without hearing what they're actually saying. If they're shaking their head while denying something, it might line up with the truth—like if someone asks "Did you take the keys?" and they shake their head "no" while saying it. But if they're shaking their head while saying "yes," that'd be weird, and I'd be suspicious. Since I don't have the audio, I'm just going by the body stuff, and it feels... consistent? Not like they're acting out of character or anything. The nodding and eyebrow lifts seem to match what they're saying in a natural way, not forced.  

I guess my gut says they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not gonna claim I'm certain. Body language can be so tricky—what looks like a "sign" to me might just be their normal way of talking. If I had to guess, I'd say the behavior doesn't scream "lying" to me, but it doesn't scream "truth" either. It just feels... ordinary. Like someone who's not hiding anything, but not necessarily trying to prove they're honest either. So yeah, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to hear the full context before I'd be totally sure.

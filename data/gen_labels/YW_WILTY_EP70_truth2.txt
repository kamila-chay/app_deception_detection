Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there's not a ton of obvious nervous tells—like, no frowning, no weird blinking, no hands fidgeting or covering their face. They're actually holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels pretty consistent with someone being honest. I've noticed before that when people lie, they often avert their gaze or seem distracted, but here they're looking right at the person, and even have this "gaze up" thing going on, which sometimes happens when you're recalling something real, not making it up. That part makes it feel like they're being genuine.

But then again, I know some people can be really good at lying without showing any of those classic signs—like, they might be calm, practiced, or just naturally not expressive. Maybe they're not nervous because they're confident in their story, or maybe they're just not the type to fidget. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any visible tells, so the absence of nervousness doesn't *prove* truthfulness. It could also be that they're just used to being interviewed or they're not stressed about the situation. Like, if it's a routine question, they wouldn't get flustered. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward truth just because of the consistent eye contact and lack of other stress cues, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like the most likely scenario based on what I'm seeing—no red flags jumping out at me—but I can totally see how someone else might think, "Well, they're just good at hiding it." It's not like they're smiling or laughing like they're thrilled about the topic, but they're not avoiding eye contact either, which is the weird middle ground where truth often sits. I'd say it seems truthful, but I'd want to hear more context before I was totally sure.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm while speaking—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. Their gaze is up a bit too, not down or looking away, which sometimes happens when people are recalling details truthfully instead of fabricating. And they don't seem nervous at all: no frowning, no lip biting, no fidgeting with their hands or face. The only thing that stands out is their eyebrows are raised a bit, like they're emphasizing something or maybe surprised by the question, but that doesn't seem like a classic "lying" cue to me.  

That said, I'm not totally sold on it being "truth" either. Some people might actually raise their eyebrows when they're lying to seem innocent or to buy time to think—like they're trying to appear extra sincere. And while eye contact is often linked to truth, I've heard that in some cultures or contexts, *too* much direct eye contact can feel forced, especially if someone's rehearsing a story. Plus, the fact that they're not showing any emotional cues (like smiling or frowning) makes me wonder if they're just being very controlled, which could go either way. Maybe they're practiced at hiding their reactions, or maybe they're genuinely not stressed because they're telling the truth.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The behavior *looks* like it could be truthful—calm, engaged, no obvious signs of stress—but without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's tricky. If they were making up a story, I'd expect more nervous habits, but they're not showing any. Still, I can't rule out that they're just really good at staying cool. I'd lean toward them being truthful based on what I see, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like it *could* be true, but I'd want to hear the actual words before I'd feel confident either way.

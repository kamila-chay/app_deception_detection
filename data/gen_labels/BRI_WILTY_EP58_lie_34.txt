Looking at the clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being truthful here. What stands out to me is how they're moving their head—specifically, they keep shaking it side-to-side while they're talking, almost like they're saying "no" or disagreeing without actually saying the word. And their gaze is all over the place: sometimes they're looking right at the person they're talking to, but then they'll glance sideways, like they're avoiding direct eye contact. I've heard that when people are being deceptive, they might avoid eye contact or use head movements to signal discomfort, so that part makes me lean toward "lying" a bit.

But then I keep thinking, maybe it's just nervousness? Like, if they're stressed about the question or just naturally fidgety, head shaking and looking away could just be them processing what to say, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're trying to be honest but feel awkward. Also, they don't seem to be doing any of the classic "deception tells" like fidgeting with their hands, avoiding eye contact completely, or smiling when they shouldn't—those things are absent here, which makes me wonder if it's actually a normal conversation. Maybe they're just not a very expressive person, or the situation is just tense for other reasons.

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The head shaking and sideways glances are suspicious, but they could easily be innocent. I'd need more context—like what they're actually saying—to feel confident. If they're denying something clearly false while shaking their head, that's a red flag. But if they're just reacting to a confusing question, it might not mean anything. I'm not going to say "they're lying," but I'd be cautious and maybe double-check if I had to make a call. It feels like it could go either way, but the head movement is making me lean toward deception, just barely.

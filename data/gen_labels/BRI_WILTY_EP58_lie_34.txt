Watching the clip, I’m inclined to think the person might be leaning toward deception. The repeated side-to-side head shaking during their speech seems like a subtle form of disagreement, almost as if they’re non-verbally saying “no” while trying to avoid outright denial. Their gaze is also somewhat inconsistent—sometimes making eye contact, but often darting sideways, which can suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct connection. These behaviors align with what’s often seen in deceptive individuals, who might use such cues to manage the tension of lying.

That said, I can’t completely dismiss the possibility that nervousness or awkwardness is causing these behaviors. People under stress or those who are naturally uneasy might exhibit similar signs without any intent to deceive. The absence of more overt deception signals, like full eye contact avoidance, fidgeting, or inappropriate smiling, complicates the picture and suggests this might still be an honest interaction, albeit a tense or uncomfortable one.

Still, weighing these observations, I lean slightly toward the idea that they might be less than truthful here. The combination of the head shaking and the evasive glances is enough to raise suspicion, even if it’s not definitive proof. Without more context, such as what’s actually being said, it’s hard to be certain, but overall, the cues push me toward thinking there’s a good chance they could be lying.

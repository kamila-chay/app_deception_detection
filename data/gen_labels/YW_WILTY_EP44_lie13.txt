Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching the clip. I noticed they were keeping their gaze locked on the person they're talking to the whole time, which actually feels a bit unusual if they were trying to hide something—most people I've seen lie tend to look away or fidget more. They also had this subtle head tilt, like they were really listening, and their lips were pulled up just slightly at the corners, which might look like a small, genuine smile rather than something forced. But then there were these little awkward pauses where their mouth stayed closed, and their eyebrows were raised a few times—like they were caught off guard or trying to think of the right words.  

On one hand, those pauses and raised brows could be signs they're constructing a story, which makes me wonder if they're being dishonest. But on the other hand, people often do that when they're just thinking carefully about what to say, especially if they're nervous about the topic—not necessarily lying. The lack of other classic "lie" cues really stands out too: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no exaggerated expressions. If anything, the way they kept their eyes on the other person feels more like they're trying to seem sincere, not deceptive.  

I guess it’s hard to rule out deception entirely because the pauses *do* feel a bit unnatural, but I’m not sure if that’s just them being careful with their words or something else. Maybe they’re just uncomfortable with the question, not lying. Honestly, I’d lean toward them telling the truth based on the direct gaze and the head tilt, but I can’t be certain—it’s easy to misread those little pauses. It’s one of those cases where the absence of obvious lies might actually be the clue, not the presence of them.

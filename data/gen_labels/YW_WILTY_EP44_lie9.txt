Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from watching this clip. The person seems a bit tense, especially with how they're raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes really wide—like they're trying to look extra sincere or maybe even a little startled by the question. That exaggerated eye opening often shows up when people are trying to convince someone they're being truthful, but it could also just be their natural way of emphasizing something. Then there's the lip corners pulled down, which feels like they're holding back some frustration or discomfort, and the shrug at the end—it’s not a big, dramatic shrug, but it feels like they're sort of... disengaging or saying "I don't know if I should answer this."  

On the flip side, though, maybe they're just genuinely surprised by the question. People do raise their eyebrows when they're taken off guard, and that wide-eyed look could just be them leaning into the conversation to seem engaged. The lip corners down might not mean deception—it could just be them being serious or tired, and the shrug might be a nervous habit, not necessarily a sign they're lying. I’ve seen so many people shrug when they’re not sure how to answer, and it doesn’t always mean they’re hiding something.  

Honestly, the thing that sticks with me is how *still* they are otherwise—no fidgeting, no looking away, they’re actually keeping eye contact. If they were lying, I’d expect more nervous tells like avoiding the gaze or fidgeting with their hands, but they’re not doing that. So maybe they’re telling the truth, and the raised eyebrows and lip thing are just them being a little stressed about the situation. But then again, some people who lie are really good at staying calm, so that still leaves me unsure.  

I’d lean toward them not lying, just because the lack of other classic "tells" (like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting) makes it feel less like deception, but I’m not at all confident. It’s one of those clips where it’s really easy to second-guess yourself—like, maybe they’re hiding something but doing it really well. Either way, it’s hard to tell without knowing the context of what they’re being asked about.

Honestly, it's difficult to be certain just from watching this clip, but I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. The way they raise their eyebrows and open their eyes wide seems a bit exaggerated, almost like they're trying too hard to appear sincere or startled by the question. That kind of wide-eyed expression often appears when someone is attempting to convince others they’re telling the truth, but it can also be a sign of discomfort or feigned surprise. The lip corners pulled down suggest they might be holding back some frustration or unease, and the subtle shrug at the end gives an impression of disengagement or reluctance to answer fully.  

While it’s possible they are genuinely surprised or simply serious, these cues combined raise some doubt. The stillness and steady eye contact are less typical of someone anxious about lying, which complicates things. Still, some individuals can mask their deception very well by maintaining composure. Given this, I lean toward thinking they might not be completely truthful, though it’s far from certain. Without more context, it remains tricky to say definitively, but overall, the behaviors hint at a higher likelihood of concealment than honesty.

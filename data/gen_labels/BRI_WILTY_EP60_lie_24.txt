Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit of a toss-up. The way they're raising their eyebrows a couple of times while answering feels a little off, like they're trying to seem surprised or maybe a bit too eager to confirm something. And that sideways glance they keep making while still looking at the person? It’s weirdly inconsistent—like they’re trying to maintain eye contact but can’t quite hold it, which sometimes happens when people are nervous or not being fully honest. The nodding seems a bit over-the-top too, like they’re forcing agreement to seem cooperative.  

But here’s where I hesitate: they’re still looking directly at the person most of the time, which usually leans toward truthfulness, and they don’t seem fidgety or avoidant in other ways—no lip biting, no hands moving around, just that one thing with the eyebrows. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive or genuinely surprised by the question, not lying. The sideways glance could just be them thinking or distracted by something in the room, not deception. And the lack of other classic "lie signs" (like avoiding eye contact entirely or sweating) makes it feel less clear-cut.  

Honestly, I’d say it’s possible they’re being deceptive—those raised eyebrows and the sideways glance are the strongest red flags—but it’s also totally plausible they’re just being a little awkward or genuinely processing the question. Without knowing what they’re talking about, it’s hard to say for sure. I’d lean toward "maybe" but not "definitely," and I’d want to hear the actual conversation to be more confident. It’s not the clearest example, but the cues are there enough to make me wonder.

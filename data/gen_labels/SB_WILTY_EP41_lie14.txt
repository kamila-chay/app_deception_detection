Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's pretty ambiguous. At first glance, the frequent blinking stands out to me; I've heard that people often blink more when they're stressed or trying to remember something, which could be a sign of deception. And that downward chin movement—they seem to be pressing their chin down like they're holding back something, which feels a bit defensive. Then there's the head shaking, like they're saying "no" to something, but they're also nodding along with whoever they're talking to. That kind of mixed signal makes me pause—maybe they're genuinely confused or just being overly emphatic, not necessarily lying.  

But here's where it gets tricky: they're keeping direct eye contact the whole time, which usually goes against the "liars avoid eye contact" stereotype. I've seen a lot of people do that when they're trying to seem honest, so that actually leans toward truthfulness. And the shrug at the end? Feels casual, like they're saying "I don't know" or "it's not my problem," which could just be their normal way of talking, not a sign of deception. The head tilting too—it's almost like they're listening intently, which doesn't scream "lying."  

I keep circling back to the blinking though. It's not just occasional; it's constant. If it were just a few quick blinks, I'd write it off as nervous habit, but this feels more intense. Still, I know people blink more when they're tired, or maybe the lighting's bothering their eyes. And the chin movement—could be they're just adjusting their posture without thinking. Honestly, without knowing the context of the conversation, it's hard to say. They might be telling the truth but just uncomfortable, or they might be lying while trying too hard to seem calm. I'd lean slightly toward deception just because of the blinking and the chin, but I'd be really hesitant to call it for sure. It's one of those clips where you just can't tell from the body language alone—maybe they're just a nervous person, not a liar.

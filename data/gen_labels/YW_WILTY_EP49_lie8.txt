While it's difficult to be completely certain, there are several cues that make me lean toward the possibility that this person might be deceiving. Their steady eye contact is somewhat unusual for someone lying, as people often avoid looking directly at others when being deceptive, but it's not a definitive rule. The scowling and frowning, along with raised eyebrows, could indicate genuine confusion or frustration, yet these expressions might also reflect the stress and tension that come with fabricating a story. The head shaking at the end, which seems like a natural dismissal, could simply be a defensive reaction designed to deflect suspicion. Additionally, their overall tense demeanor and lack of smiling might suggest discomfort typical of someone trying to maintain a lie. Although these signs aren’t conclusive on their own, taken together they create a subtle pattern that leans me toward suspecting some level of deception, even if it's not entirely clear-cut. Without more context or verbal cues, I can’t be fully sure, but based on the behavior alone, I am somewhat inclined to think they might not be telling the whole truth.

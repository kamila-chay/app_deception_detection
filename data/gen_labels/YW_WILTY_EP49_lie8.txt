Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—this one's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is how they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels like it could go either way. Usually, when people are being deceptive, they tend to avoid eye contact, so that actually makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, but I know that's not a hard rule. They're also scowling and frowning a lot, with their eyebrows raised like they're genuinely confused or frustrated—maybe they're annoyed by the question, not necessarily lying. That head shaking at the end feels like a natural "no" or dismissal, which could just be their reaction to the topic, not a sign of deception.  

But then again, the scowl and frowning *could* be stress from trying to keep up a lie, especially if they're feeling pressured. I've seen people who get tense when they're making things up, and the raised eyebrows might even suggest they're trying to seem surprised or innocent, which sometimes happens when lying. The fact that they're not smiling or laughing either feels a bit off for someone being honest—they seem pretty tense overall. Still, the eye contact keeps bugging me because it's such a common deception cue that's *missing* here. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more, not lock eyes like that.  

Honestly, though, I'm not confident either way. It could just be that they're naturally a grumpy person or really upset about whatever they're discussing, and the frowning is unrelated to lying. I'd need more context—like what they're actually saying—to feel sure. But based on the behavior alone, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, mostly because of that steady eye contact. That said, I could easily be wrong, and if I were to guess, I'd say it's probably not deception, but I wouldn't bet on it.

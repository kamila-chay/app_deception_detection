Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly not 100% sure if they're lying or not. It's really tricky. The person keeps raising their eyebrows while also frowning a bit—that kind of mixed expression makes me think they might be trying to seem calm or engaged while actually feeling stressed about the question. Like, they're forcing a neutral or even slightly positive look (hence the raised brows) but their frown suggests some underlying tension. Then there's that slight chin lift—like they're tilting their chin up just a tiny bit, almost like they're trying to appear confident or in control. And they're holding steady eye contact the whole time, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I've also read that some liars overdo it to seem honest. 

But here's why I'm hesitant: that frown and raised eyebrows could just be them genuinely confused or frustrated by the question, not necessarily lying. Maybe the topic is making them uncomfortable for a real reason, not because they're hiding something. The chin movement doesn't feel super exaggerated—it could just be their natural way of nodding or shifting. And honestly, they don't have any other classic "lie cues" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiles, which makes me wonder if I'm overinterpreting the eyebrow thing. Sometimes people just look tense when they're thinking hard, especially if they're nervous about being on camera. 

I guess my gut leans a little toward deception because of the combination of the conflicting facial expressions and that deliberate chin lift—those feel like subtle attempts to manage how they're perceived. But I'm really not confident about it. It could easily just be someone who's naturally expressive or just really stressed about the situation. Without knowing the context of what they're being asked, it's almost impossible to say for sure. I'd say it's a maybe, but not a clear "yes."

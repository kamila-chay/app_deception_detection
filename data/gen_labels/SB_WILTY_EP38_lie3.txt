This is a bit complicated, but watching the clip, there are some subtle cues that suggest the person might not be entirely truthful. They smile, but it seems somewhat forced, as if they’re trying to mask their true feelings. Their eyebrows are raised quite high, which can indicate underlying nervousness rather than genuine calmness. Also, the way they repeatedly pull their chin down and avoid direct eye contact by looking down often feels like someone trying to hide something. The sideways head tilts add to the impression of discomfort or evasiveness. These behaviors often align with what people do when they’re being deceptive—they tend to avoid direct gaze and show micro-expressions linked to tension.

That said, none of these signs are definitive. It’s possible the person is just shy or stressed, perhaps nervous about being recorded. People sometimes smile out of nervousness, and their body language might simply be their normal way of thinking or reacting under pressure. The absence of more overt signs of lying—like fidgeting or rapid blinking—means we can’t be certain. It could easily be someone who’s uncomfortable or uneasy rather than blatantly deceptive.

So, while I wouldn’t be too quick to label this as a lie, the combination of these subtle indicators makes me lean slightly toward the possibility that they could be hiding something. It’s far from conclusive, but based exclusively on these nonverbal cues, I’d say there’s reason to be a bit skeptical about their honesty.

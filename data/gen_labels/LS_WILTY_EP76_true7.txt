Honestly, watching this clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain—there's always room for doubt with these things. What stands out is how steady their eye contact is: they're looking directly at the camera (or whoever they're speaking to) the whole time, and their gaze is actually up, not down or away. I've noticed that when people are recalling something real, they often look up like they're mentally searching their memory, whereas liars sometimes glance down or away to avoid scrutiny. Here, they're not avoiding it at all—they're holding that gaze while thinking, which feels natural for someone being honest.  

Also, there's zero sign of nervous energy. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses with their mouth shut, no raised eyebrows or scowling. If they were lying, I'd expect at least some small tells like that—like fingers tapping or lips tightening—but they're completely still, calm even. That makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying, which usually lines up with truth-telling.  

But I can see why someone might question it. Maybe they're just really practiced at lying? Some people can fake eye contact perfectly, and the "gaze up" thing isn't a hard rule—some liars do look up too when they're fabricating. Or maybe they're just quiet by nature, not because they're hiding something. I've seen people who are naturally reserved still tell the truth without any of those "nervous" gestures.  

Still, the combination of direct eye contact *and* the absence of any stress cues feels more consistent with honesty than deception. It doesn't *feel* like someone who's trying to cover up. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it—there's always that tiny chance they're just really good at it. Honestly, it's the lack of *anything* off-kilter that tips me toward truth more than the specific actions themselves.

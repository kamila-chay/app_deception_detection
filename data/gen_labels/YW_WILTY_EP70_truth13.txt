Honestly, watching the clip, I'm trying to figure this out. The person is looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time—that feels like they're engaged, which usually leans toward truthfulness. But then they keep glancing down, which is a bit confusing. I've heard people say looking down can mean someone's uncomfortable or hiding something, but I also know it can just mean they're thinking carefully or being humble. It's not a clear sign either way.  

Their head is leaning forward a bit while they speak, which usually feels like they're invested in the conversation—like they're trying to connect, not avoid it. And honestly, they don't seem nervous at all: no fidgeting, no weird facial tics, no over-the-top gestures. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe some hesitation or micro-expressions, but they're just speaking calmly.  

But here's where I'm second-guessing myself: maybe they're a really good liar who stays calm on purpose. Or maybe the gaze down is just because they're reading notes or the lighting's bad, not because they're hiding something. Truth-tellers can look down too—like when they're recalling details or being thoughtful. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact *at all* (gaze toward interlocutor is true) feels more consistent with honesty than deception.  

I guess I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because the absence of nervous behaviors *plus* the direct engagement seems to outweigh the down-glances. But I can't say for sure—people are complicated. If I had to guess, I'd say they're being truthful, but I'd still want to hear more context before I'd be confident. It's not like there's a single "tell" here; it's just... the whole vibe feels steady.

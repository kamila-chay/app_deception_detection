Hmm, this is a tough one to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone who seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like smiling, frowning, or fidgeting that I'd usually associate with lying. They're actually making eye contact with the person they're talking to, which feels like a good sign for honesty, but they're also looking down quite a bit. I've noticed that when people are being truthful, they might glance down while thinking or being humble, but liars sometimes do that too when they're constructing a story. So that's a bit confusing—could go either way.

Then there's the crossed fingers and palms up. Crossed fingers... yeah, I've heard that's often called a "lie sign" in pop culture, like they're secretly hoping for luck or trying to avoid saying something. But honestly, I've seen people cross their fingers all the time for no reason—like when they're just nervous or it's a habit. And palms up is usually seen as open and honest, which would lean toward truthfulness. So those two things kind of cancel each other out in my head. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they're not doing that. They're actually pretty still, except for those crossed fingers. 

On the flip side, maybe they're not lying at all—they're just someone who naturally looks down when they're speaking, or they cross their fingers when they're trying to be extra sincere. I've known people who do that without any deception. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact feels important—truthful people often maintain eye contact unless they're really uncomfortable, but liars sometimes overcompensate by staring too hard. Here, it seems natural. 

I guess my gut is leaning toward "not lying" because of the eye contact and the lack of other tells, but I'm really not sure. It's easy to overread things like crossed fingers—I've definitely misjudged people before because of that. If I were to bet, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd feel uneasy about it. Like, maybe they're just a quiet person, or maybe they're lying but doing it really well. There's not enough to be certain, and I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to make sense of it. Honestly, I'd say it's ambiguous—no clear signs either way, just a few things that could mean anything.

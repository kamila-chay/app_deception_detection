Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn. The person has their arms crossed the whole time, which usually makes me think they might be feeling defensive or closed off—but I know that's not always a sign of lying. Sometimes people just cross their arms when they're comfortable, cold, or just naturally sit that way. And honestly, they don't seem nervous at all: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact (wait, actually, they're not looking at the person they're talking to—gaze is down or sideways, but that's not super unusual either. Some people just don't make eye contact when they're thinking or being calm). They're not smiling, but they're not scowling either, so it's not like they're angry or hiding something behind a fake grin. The lack of other "tells" like excessive blinking or shifting around makes me lean toward them being straightforward, but I'm not 100% sure.  

On the flip side, arms crossed *could* be a subtle sign they're holding something back, especially if they're not making eye contact. But then again, maybe they're just tired or in a neutral mood. I've seen people cross their arms while telling the truth all the time—like when they're just listening thoughtfully. Without more context, like what they're saying or the situation, it's hard to tell. I guess the thing that sticks with me is how *still* they are otherwise. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in their face or hands, but everything feels... relaxed. So maybe it's truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It’s just hard to say for sure without hearing the words.

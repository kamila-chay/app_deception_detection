Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning a bit toward them not being entirely truthful based on what I'm seeing. The way their lips are pulled down at the corners and the subtle upward movement of their chin—like they're holding their jaw tight or trying to seem composed—feels a bit off to me. It’s not a full scowl, but that downward lip tension often shows discomfort, especially when someone’s trying to keep their expression neutral. And the fact that they’re keeping steady eye contact while doing that? That’s interesting because sometimes people who are lying will overcompensate with too much eye contact, but it could also just mean they’re trying to seem sincere.  

But here’s where I hesitate: they were laughing, and that’s a big one. Laughter can be nervous or fake, but it can also be genuine—maybe they were just reacting to something funny in the conversation, not the lie itself. The palms-up gesture too, that’s usually seen as open or honest, so that’s working against the "lying" idea. And honestly, people don’t always show textbook signs when they’re being deceptive; sometimes they’re just really good at hiding it. I’ve seen truth-tellers get tense too, especially if they’re stressed about the situation, not necessarily lying.  

So yeah, I’d say it’s possible they’re hiding something, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. The lip and chin stuff sticks out, but the laughter and the open palms make me think maybe it’s just them being awkward or nervous about the topic, not actively deceiving. It’s really hard to tell without more context—like what they’re even talking about. If I had to guess, I’d say maybe *some* of it is a lie, but I’m not confident. It feels like a maybe, not a definitely.

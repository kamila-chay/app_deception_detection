Based on the cues I’m seeing, I lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their lips are pulled down at the corners and there’s a subtle lift of the chin, almost as if they’re holding their jaw tight or trying to maintain control—these signs often suggest discomfort or guardedness. While it’s not a full scowl, that downward lip tension can indicate someone is uneasy, especially when they’re attempting to keep a neutral expression. At the same time, their steady eye contact is notable. Sometimes people who lie overcompensate by maintaining too much eye contact, though it could also mean they’re trying hard to appear sincere.

On the other hand, they were laughing, and laughter can go either way—it might be nervous or even fake, but it can also be genuine, depending on the situation. The palms-up gesture they made usually signals openness or honesty, which complicates the picture. Plus, not everyone shows classic signs of lying; some people get tense simply because they’re stressed, not necessarily because they’re being deceptive.

Putting it all together, I’m inclined to think there’s a good chance they’re not being fully truthful, but I’m not fully convinced. The lip and chin tension points toward some discomfort that might align with hiding something, but the laughter and open palms could indicate nervousness or awkwardness rather than outright deception. Without more context about what’s being said, it’s tough to say for sure. If pressed, I would lean toward some level of dishonesty, though it’s far from a certainty.

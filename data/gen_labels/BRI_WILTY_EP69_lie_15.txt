Hmm, this is actually a bit of a puzzle. The person in the clip seems to be nodding while they're talking, which feels a little unusual—like they're agreeing with themselves or trying to seem engaged, but it's not super natural. Their gaze is mostly sideways instead of meeting the person they're speaking to, which I've noticed before can sometimes happen when someone's trying to avoid direct eye contact while talking. They also raised their eyebrows a few times, which might just be surprise or emphasis, but I've heard that can be a subtle stress signal too. On the flip side, they have their palms up like they're being open or honest, which usually leans toward truthfulness, and they're not fidgeting or avoiding touch like people often do when they're lying. No nervous laughter, no awkward pauses, nothing that screams "this person is hiding something." But then again, the sideways gaze is kind of a red flag—most people don't look away like that when they're just being relaxed or thoughtful. It's confusing because if they were being honest, you'd expect them to look more directly at the person, but the palms up and lack of other tells make me think maybe they're just a bit anxious, not necessarily lying. I'm not 100% sure, though—sometimes people glance sideways when they're just thinking or distracted, and the eyebrow raises could just be them trying to seem friendly. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. I'd lean slightly toward deception because of that gaze, but it's really close, and I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those cases where the cues are mixed up enough that you could easily read it the other way.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone. From what I can see, the person seems really calm and composed the whole time—they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, not making any obvious nervous gestures like touching their face or blinking a lot. In fact, they're just sitting there pretty relaxed, answering questions directly without any of the classic "tells" people usually associate with lying. If I were just watching this without any context, I might lean toward thinking they're being truthful because they're not acting out of the ordinary. Like, when people are stressed about lying, they often do things like look away or fidget, but this person isn't doing any of that. It almost feels... too smooth, maybe?

But then I start second-guessing myself because I've heard that some people who are lying are actually *really* good at hiding it—they might be rehearsing or just naturally calm under pressure. So their lack of nervousness could actually be a sign they're trying too hard to seem honest, like they're overcompensating. I mean, the absence of "signs" doesn't prove truthfulness; it just means they're not showing those specific cues. And honestly, most of those "tells" aren't even reliable in the first place—research says they're way more common in truth-tellers than liars. So maybe their calmness is just how they are, and not a clue at all.

I also wonder if there's something in their tone or the way they're phrasing things that the video doesn't capture well, but since I can't hear it, I'm just going by body language. Without any of the usual red flags (like avoiding eye contact or tense shoulders), it's hard to say for sure. It’s possible they're telling the truth, but it’s also possible they're just a really controlled liar. Honestly, I'd be hesitant to call it either way based on this alone—I'd want more context or to see them in a different situation. Right now, it feels like they're just... normal, which could mean either truth or deception, and I can't really tell the difference. I'm not confident about it either way.

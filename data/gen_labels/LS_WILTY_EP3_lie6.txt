Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty calm at first glance—they're smiling (lip corners up, which feels natural, not forced), and they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which is interesting because I usually hear people say liars avoid eye contact. But they're also tilting their head a bit and turning it sideways a little, and their eyebrows are raised. That kind of makes me wonder if they're trying to seem friendly or maybe a bit confused? Like, they're not scowling or frowning, which is good, but the head tilting and sideways glance... I've seen that in people who are thinking hard or maybe even trying to seem sincere. 

Then there's the mouth being closed with these awkward pauses. It's not like they're fumbling or sweating, but just... quiet for a second. That could be them gathering thoughts while being truthful, or it could be them making up something. I'm leaning more toward the first one though, because they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" stuff—no hand rubbing, no blinking a lot, no laughing to cover up. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or that "too-perfect" smile, but this feels... low-key. Like they're just a bit hesitant, maybe because the topic is sensitive, not because they're hiding something. 

But wait, the sideways gaze is throwing me off. Some people say liars look away, but others say they stare to seem honest. So that could go either way. And the eyebrow raise—could be surprise or skepticism, not necessarily deception. Honestly, the more I watch, the less it *feels* like deception. It feels more like someone who's being careful with their words, maybe a bit uncomfortable but not dishonest. I mean, the smile is there, the eye contact is mostly on the other person, and they're not avoiding anything. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's just... too calm for a lie, maybe? Or maybe they're just really good at hiding it. I'd need more context to be certain, but based on this alone, I'd lean toward truth.

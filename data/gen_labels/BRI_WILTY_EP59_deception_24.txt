Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're lying or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. They're maintaining steady eye contact the whole time—gazing directly at the person they're talking to—which usually makes me lean toward truthfulness. I've heard that people who lie often avoid eye contact, so that feels like a strong sign they're being honest. Plus, they're not fidgeting, blinking a lot, or doing any of those nervous little gestures like rubbing their hands or covering their mouth. That calmness could mean they're not stressed about what they're saying, which might point to truth. 

But then there's the head shaking. They're shaking their head a few times while they're speaking, and that's throwing me off. Sometimes people shake their heads naturally when they're denying something or disagreeing, like "no" or "I don't think so," which could be part of the conversation, not deception. But if they're shaking their head while trying to convince someone of something they're not sure about, it might hint at internal conflict. I mean, if they were totally truthful, their head movement might feel more aligned with their words, but here it's just... there. No other cues to go on. 

On the flip side, some people who lie actually *practice* holding eye contact to seem trustworthy, so that could be a red herring. And the head shake might just be a habit—like how some folks nod or shake their head without thinking. Without knowing what they're saying or the context, it's hard to tell if the head shake matches their words or contradicts them. If they're saying "yes" but shaking their head "no," that'd be a clear sign, but the video doesn't show that. 

So yeah, I'm stuck between two things: the eye contact feels like it's saying "truth," but the head shake feels a little too deliberate for a natural gesture. I'd probably say it's more likely they're being truthful because of the lack of other nervous signs, but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those clips where you'd need more context to feel confident. Maybe they're just a head-shaker by nature, and I'm overthinking it. Honestly, I'd lean toward truth, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's close enough that I wouldn't bet on either side without more to go on.

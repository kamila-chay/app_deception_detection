Watching the clip, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that the person might be deceiving, though it's not entirely certain. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which typically suggests truthfulness, and they show no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or excessive blinking. However, the consistent head shaking while speaking feels somewhat off. While head shaking can be a natural gesture or signal disagreement, in this context it seems a bit deliberate and possibly out of sync with what they're saying, hinting at some internal conflict or discomfort. 

Also, the lack of nervous gestures might not be as telling as it appears since some people who lie consciously practice maintaining calmness and steady eye contact to appear trustworthy. Without knowing the exact words or context, it's challenging to definitively interpret the head shake, but its presence alongside otherwise calm behavior raises a bit of doubt. 

So, although the steady eye contact could indicate honesty, the head-shaking behavior and the possibility that the calm demeanor is a practiced facade make me lean slightly toward deception. I wouldn't say it's a clear conclusion, but given these cues, I tend to suspect they might not be entirely truthful.

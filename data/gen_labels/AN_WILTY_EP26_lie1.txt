While it's challenging to be certain from just this clip, some cues lead me to lean toward the possibility that the person might not be fully truthful. The repeated head shaking, though typically a clear "no," seems somewhat stiff and forced here, suggesting potential nervousness. Additionally, the downward gaze points to discomfort or avoidance, which can be signs of evasiveness. That said, these behaviors can also result from thoughtful consideration or cultural politeness, so they aren't definitive proof of deception.

Interestingly, other common signs of lying—like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or excessive blinking—aren't present, which makes the case less clear-cut. The absence of these additional nervous tells might indicate that if there is deception, it's being handled quite skillfully. Overall, while the mannerisms raise some suspicion and make me lean slightly toward thinking the person could be hiding something, there's not enough evidence to say this confidently. It remains quite ambiguous without more context, but I’d say there is a subtle inclination to believe the person might be less than truthful.

Honestly, it's a bit tough to say for sure just from this clip. The person is definitely shaking their head "no" a couple of times, and their gaze is mostly down—not looking at the person they're talking to. That downward gaze makes me lean toward thinking they might be uncomfortable or avoiding something, which sometimes happens when people are being evasive. Head shaking is usually a clear "no," but the way they're doing it feels a bit stiff, like they're forcing it a little, which could be a sign of nervousness if they're lying. 

But then again, I've seen people look down while they're just thinking carefully about their answer, or even out of politeness, especially in some cultural contexts. It doesn't *have* to mean deception. And the head shake itself—while it's a "no," it could just be a straightforward response to a question like "Did you see the report?" without any hidden meaning. The thing is, there's no other obvious nervous tells here: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles or eye contact avoidance beyond the gaze down. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more of those little signs, like touching their face or blinking a lot, but there's nothing like that. 

So yeah, it's a toss-up. On one hand, the downward gaze and the head shake *feel* a bit off-kilter for a simple "no," making me wonder if they're trying to cover something up. But on the other hand, it could just be how they naturally respond to questions—maybe they're shy, or the question was direct, or they're just not a very expressive person. I'd probably need to hear the actual question they're answering or see more of the interaction to be sure. Without that, I'd say it's ambiguous—leaning slightly toward "maybe" but not confident at all. It’s the kind of thing where you’d probably ask a colleague, "What do you think they’re hiding?" and get two different answers.

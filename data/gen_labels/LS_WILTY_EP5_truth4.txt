Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels like they're telling the truth—though I can totally see why someone might think they're lying at first glance. The frowning eyebrows and downturned lip corners definitely look tense, which usually makes people think "they're hiding something," but I've noticed that when people are genuinely upset or frustrated about what they're saying—like if they're recounting something painful or disagreeing with something—they often show that kind of expression without being deceptive. It's not a classic "lie" sign; it just looks like they're processing something heavy.  

Then there's the eye contact—they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which is interesting because a lot of people assume liars avoid eye contact. But I've learned that's not always true; some liars force eye contact to seem convincing, while truth-tellers often hold it naturally when they're engaged. Here, the gaze feels steady, not darting or evasive. They're also nodding and tilting their head slightly, which seems like normal, attentive listening—like they're genuinely trying to connect with the other person.  

On the flip side, the raised eyebrows *do* make me pause for a second. Sometimes that's a sign of skepticism or hesitation, which could hint at doubt, but it could also just mean they're surprised by the question or trying to emphasize a point. And yeah, the frown is weirdly persistent—it's not a quick twitch, it's a consistent thing. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous tics like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they're not doing any of that. No awkward pauses, no hands covering their mouth, no fake smiles. The whole thing just feels... heavy, but not forced.  

Honestly, the more I watch, the less it feels like lying. The lack of classic "stress" cues (like blinking a lot or fidgeting) stands out to me. If they were making it up, I'd expect more physical tension. This feels more like they're struggling to say something hard, not trying to hide something. But I'm not gonna claim I know for sure—people's expressions can be so context-dependent. Maybe they're just having a bad day, or maybe they're genuinely upset about the topic. Either way, the behavior doesn't scream "liar" to me. It just feels like someone being real, even if it's uncomfortable.

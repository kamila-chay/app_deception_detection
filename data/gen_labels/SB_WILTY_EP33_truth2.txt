Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty steady. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no darting eyes or looking away too much—and they're nodding along while they speak, which feels like they're genuinely engaging with the conversation. Their body language is a bit mixed, though: their arms are folded across their chest, but they're also kind of open in a way, not clenched or defensive. They don't seem fidgety at all—no touching their face, no weird blinking, nothing that screams "nervous." They even look up at times, like they're thinking or recalling something, not avoiding eye contact like people sometimes do when they're lying.  

That said, I'm not totally sold on it being "truth" just because of that. Some people are really good at staying calm when they're lying—they might even overdo the eye contact or nodding to seem extra sincere. And honestly, arms folded can sometimes mean they're just comfortable, not necessarily truthful. Like, maybe they're just resting their arms or it's their natural posture. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any of those classic "tells," so the absence of nervous gestures doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth—it just makes it less likely, maybe.  

Still, what stands out is how relaxed they seem overall. There's no tension in their face, no forced smiles or frowns, and they're not rushing through their words. If they were making it up, I'd expect more hesitation or awkward shifts, but they're speaking steadily. I'd lean toward them being truthful just based on how present they seem, but I'd also be cautious—people can fake calmness. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without more context, but the video doesn't give me any red flags for deception.

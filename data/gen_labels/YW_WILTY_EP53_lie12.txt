Hmm, this is tricky. From what I can see in the clip, the person seems pretty still otherwise—no obvious smiles, frowns, or big gestures. But there's something going on with their eyes and head. Their eyebrows are raised a lot, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, and they're blinking way more than usual—like, constantly. They also keep leaning their head forward slightly toward the person they're talking to, which feels a bit intense, but they're definitely looking right at them the whole time. 

I'm leaning a little toward deception because those raised eyebrows and the frequent blinking can sometimes show stress or trying to think of something, especially if it's not matching what they're saying. The head moving forward might be them trying to seem engaged, but it could also be a nervous habit. And the fact they're holding eye contact *while* doing those other things is interesting—liars often avoid eye contact, so that part makes me think maybe they're being truthful? But then again, some liars work extra hard to keep eye contact to seem honest. 

On the flip side, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Maybe they're just tired or have dry eyes making them blink more. Or maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question and that's why their eyebrows are up—they're not lying, they're just reacting. The head leaning forward could just be them being attentive, not deceptive. Without knowing what they're talking about or the situation, it's really hard to tell. I mean, everyone blinks a lot when they're nervous about *anything*, not just lying. 

Honestly, I'm not sure. The signs point both ways, and body language alone isn't foolproof. I'd say it's possible they're being deceptive, but it's just as likely they're just stressed or caught off guard. I'd need more context to feel confident about it—like what the actual question was or if they're usually this expressive. For now, I'd say it's ambiguous, but if I had to guess, I'd lean slightly toward deception just because of the combination of those specific cues, even though I know it's not certain.

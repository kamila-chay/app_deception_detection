Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or avoiding eye contact. They’re not smiling or frowning, which is interesting because people often try to mask emotions when lying, but here they’re just... still. The thing that stands out is they keep their lips slightly pushed out, like they’re puckering a little, and their eyes are looking upward, not at whoever they’re talking to. 

At first glance, the upward gaze makes me think they might be recalling something—like when you’re trying to remember a detail, you often look up or away. That’s common for both truth-telling (e.g., "Let me think...") and lying (e.g., "Hmm, what should I say?"). The lips protruding is a bit trickier. I’ve seen that before when someone’s concentrating or even a little frustrated, but it’s not a clear "lie" signal. Some people do that naturally when they’re deep in thought, so it might just be their habit. 

On the other hand, if they *were* lying, the lack of other tells is weird. Liars often do things like touch their face, avoid eye contact, or have stiff posture—but here they’re just sitting there, calm, with that slight lip thing. It feels more like they’re just thinking hard than trying to cover something up. But then again, some people are really good at lying without seeming nervous, so I can’t rule that out. The absence of "awkward pauses" (since mouth closed is false) also makes me lean toward them being relaxed, which often aligns with truth-telling. 

Still, it’s really hard to say for sure. That upward gaze *could* be a sign of fabrication, and the lip thing might be subtle stress. But honestly, without more context—like what they’re saying or their usual behavior—it’s a toss-up. I’d probably guess they’re telling the truth just because they seem so composed, but I’d hesitate to say it’s definite. Body language alone is messy; it’s like trying to read a book with half the pages missing.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm leaning a bit toward deception based on what I'm seeing. The way they're moving their head—backwards and sideways while still trying to keep eye contact—feels a bit off. It's like they're physically trying to create distance but also forcing themselves to look at the person asking the question, which can happen when someone's trying to seem calm while hiding something. Their chin moving up and the corners of their mouth pulled down also seem tense, like they're holding back some emotion or trying to suppress a reaction. And the arms... they're open at first but then folded, which is confusing. Usually, folded arms are defensive, so the mix of open and folded might be a sign of internal conflict—maybe they're trying to seem approachable but are actually guarding themselves.  

But I'm really not confident about this. It could just be that they're super nervous about the situation—maybe they're stressed about the topic or the interview itself. People get all those little tension signs when they're anxious, not just when they're lying. The gaze down while still looking at the interviewer could be them thinking hard or avoiding direct eye contact because they're uncomfortable, which isn't always about lying. And the raised eyebrows? Could just be a natural reaction to a question, not a "lie signal." Honestly, I've seen so many people who look like this when they're telling the truth but are just really flustered.  

So yeah, I'm not going to say for sure, but the combo of the defensive body language and the subtle tension in their face makes me wonder. Still, I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—before I'd feel comfortable calling it deception. It's easy to misread these things, and I don't want to jump to conclusions.

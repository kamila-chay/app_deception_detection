Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's kind of ambiguous. They're definitely showing some nervous energy: their eyebrows are raised a lot, they're blinking way more than usual, and their lips are pulled back like they're tense or frustrated. They keep looking down and to the side instead of directly at whoever's talking to them, which often makes people think someone's hiding something. Their head's tilted and turned a bit too, like they're trying to seem engaged but it feels a little forced. And yeah, palms up is usually seen as open, but here it might just be them trying to appear calm while they're actually stressed.

But then again, I keep thinking about why they'd be acting this way if they were lying. Maybe they're just genuinely uncomfortable with the question—like they're trying to think hard about an answer they don't want to give, but it's true. The frowning eyebrows and lips pulled back could just be them concentrating or upset about the topic, not necessarily deception. People get all those nervous tics when they're being honest but feel pressured, especially if they're not used to being on camera. I've seen that a lot in interviews where someone's being truthful but feels defensive about the subject.

Honestly, the gaze shifting down and sideways is the part that sticks with me—it's a common sign of internal processing, not always lying. If they were fabricating something, I'd expect more fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact completely, but their hands are still and they're not shifty. The raised eyebrows and frequent blinking might just be them trying too hard to seem relaxed, which can happen when you're nervous about being honest. I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure—there's enough stuff that could go either way. It's one of those cases where the behavior feels more like anxiety than deception, but I'd need more context to be confident.

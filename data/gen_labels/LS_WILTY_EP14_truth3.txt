Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure—I've seen enough of these to know body language can be tricky. Let me walk through what I'm noticing. The person is looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like they're engaged, not avoiding eye contact. That's one thing that makes me lean toward them being truthful, because liars sometimes look away a lot. But then there's this sideways glance they do a couple times—like, not full-on avoiding, but glancing off to the side. That could be nervousness, right? Like they're trying to think of the right words. 

And they keep raising their eyebrows a bit, especially when answering. I've heard that raised eyebrows can mean surprise or skepticism, but in this context, it might just be them reacting to the question, not lying. Oh, and their chin moves up a little when they're speaking—like, it's not a big jerk, but a subtle lift. I think some people say that's a "thinking" gesture, like they're mentally gathering their thoughts, which could actually fit with someone telling the truth and being careful with their words. 

But then there's the head touching—just a quick hand to their head or shoulder. That's a common nervous tic, so that makes me second-guess. Like, maybe they *are* stressed about what they're saying. And they're nodding a lot, which usually means agreement or emphasis, but sometimes liars nod more to seem convincing. Hmm. 

The arms are open the whole time though—no crossed arms, no tight fists. That feels like openness, which is usually a sign of honesty. And they don't smile or laugh, which might seem odd, but it's not like they're frowning either. It's just neutral, which could mean they're just being serious about the topic. 

I guess the thing that's sticking with me is the combination: the direct eye contact mixed with the subtle nervous gestures. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance or fake smiles, but they're not doing that. The sideways glance and head touch feel more like someone who's genuinely trying to recall something accurately, maybe even a little anxious about getting it right. But I can't rule out that the sideways look is a lie sign—I've seen people do that when they're making things up. 

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It's a toss-up, but I'm leaning toward truth because the open posture and consistent eye contact feel stronger than the little nervous ticks. Like, if they were lying, they might try harder to seem calm—maybe force a smile or avoid eye contact. But here, they're just... being themselves, with some natural fidgets. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd be confident. It's not a clear-cut case, that's for sure.

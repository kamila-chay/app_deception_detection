Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, it feels like they're probably telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how *calm* they seem overall—no fake smiles, no frowning, no obvious signs of stress like rapid blinking or covering their mouth. Their eyes are moving around a lot—up, down, sideways—but that doesn't scream "lying" to me. People often look away or shift their gaze when they're trying to remember something, which actually happens a lot when you're being honest and recalling details.  

That said, I do notice a few things that make me pause a little. Their eyebrows are raised a lot, and their lips are pulled back slightly (not a smile, just kind of retracted), which could look a bit tense to someone watching closely. The chin moving up and down a bit might also seem like nervous energy, and the head turning sideways a few times feels a bit restless. If I were just skimming the video, I might wonder if they're trying to avoid eye contact or seem distracted, which sometimes happens when people are lying.  

But then I think about it more: when people *are* lying, they often overcompensate with fake smiles or forced calmness—like they're trying too hard to seem relaxed. Here, they’re not doing that. The lack of those classic "deception cues" (like a tight smile or avoiding gaze entirely) actually feels more consistent with someone being truthful. The eye movements and head shifts seem natural, not rehearsed. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect them to stare straight ahead or look *way* more stiff. Instead, they seem engaged but thoughtful, which matches how I'd expect someone to act when answering honestly.  

So yeah, I'm leaning toward truth, but I can totally see why someone else might second-guess it. The raised eyebrows and lip thing might throw people off if they're only looking for "red flags," but without the other signs, it just seems like normal nervousness—not deception. I'd say it's probably truthful, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's just... the absence of the "lie" stuff feels louder than the few odd little movements they're making.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them possibly not being entirely truthful, though it's really hard to say for certain. They keep their mouth closed during pauses—like they're hesitating or choosing words carefully—and their lips are pulled down at the corners, which feels a bit tense or unhappy. Their chin is moving up a bit, like they're trying to hold themselves steady, and they keep looking down instead of meeting the other person's eyes. That downward gaze and the head pulling back a little make me think they're avoiding connection, which sometimes happens when someone's uncomfortable or hiding something.  

But then again, I'm not ruling out other explanations. Maybe they're just really nervous or tired—people get awkward pauses and downcast eyes when they're stressed about anything, not just lying. The chin movement could be a nervous habit, like they're trying to steady themselves while thinking. And looking down doesn't always mean deception; some folks just feel uneasy making eye contact, especially in casual chats. I've seen people do this when they're genuinely thinking hard about an answer, not when they're making something up.  

It's tricky because the signs are subtle—there's no obvious fidgeting or fake smiles, which actually makes it harder to pin down. If they were lying, I'd expect more clear tells like excessive blinking or avoiding gaze *completely*, but they're just doing a few things that feel off. Still, the combination of the downturned lips, the pauses, and the head/eye movements adds up to me like they're not fully relaxed. I wouldn't bet money on it, but if I had to guess based on what I'm watching? I'd say the *chances* they're not being fully honest seem a little higher than not. But honestly, it's really a toss-up—could just be them being their usual self.

Honestly, while it's difficult to be completely certain, I tend to lean toward the idea that they might be less than truthful. They keep their mouth closed during pauses, as if hesitating or carefully selecting their words, and their lips pull down at the corners, which suggests some tension or discomfort. The slight upward movement of their chin seems like an attempt to steady themselves, and their tendency to look down rather than make eye contact gives the impression of avoiding connection—something often associated with someone feeling uncomfortable or possibly hiding something.

However, I can't entirely dismiss other possibilities. They might simply be nervous or tired, as people often display awkward pauses and avoid eye contact under stress, not necessarily because they're lying. The chin movement could be a habitual way to steady themselves during thought, and some people naturally avoid direct eye contact, particularly in casual conversations. This could very well be a sign of genuine thoughtfulness rather than deception.

The signs aren't overt—there’s no obvious fidgeting or forced smiles, which actually complicates the interpretation. Typically, if someone were lying, more overt signals like excessive blinking or complete gaze avoidance might be expected. Instead, it’s subtle cues such as the downturned lips, pauses, and the combination of head and eye movements that stand out. Taken together, these subtle indicators suggest they might not be fully at ease, which makes me lean slightly toward the possibility that they are not being entirely honest. But it remains a close call, and it could just be normal behavior for them.

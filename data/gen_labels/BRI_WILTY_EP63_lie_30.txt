Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing here, it's really hard to say if they're lying or not. The only thing that stands out is that they're nodding a few times while speaking—like they're agreeing with something they're saying or maybe trying to seem engaged. But you know, people nod all the time when they're just thinking or trying to sound natural, especially if they're not used to being on camera. It doesn't feel like a nervous, over-the-top nod either, which sometimes happens when someone's lying.  

On the flip side, I *don't* see any of the usual signs people look for—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact (they seem to be looking at the camera straight on), no weird blinking or lip movements. Usually, if someone's being deceptive, you might catch a few of those little tells, but here it's all pretty calm. It could be that they're just a really good liar who doesn't show stress, or maybe they're actually telling the truth and the nod is just part of how they talk.  

I've heard that some people who lie don't even realize they're doing it, so the absence of obvious cues doesn't necessarily mean they're honest. But at the same time, if they *were* lying, I'd expect maybe a bit more tension—like their voice catching or a slight pause. Here, it feels pretty smooth, like they're just answering a straightforward question. Still, I'm not going to call it a definite "truth" because you can't really know for sure without more context. It's just... quiet. Like they're not hiding anything, but also not giving much away. Honestly, I'd lean toward "probably not lying" based on how relaxed they seem, but I'd want to see more of the clip or hear the actual words before I'd feel confident. It's one of those moments where you just have to go with the vibe, and this vibe feels neutral.

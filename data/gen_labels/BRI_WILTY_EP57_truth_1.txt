From what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no looking away or down, which often happens when someone's uncomfortable or hiding something. They also nod along as they speak, which feels natural for someone confirming or emphasizing what they're saying, not like a forced gesture. Their eyebrows are raised a bit too, which sometimes happens when people are being sincere or trying to seem open, though I know that can be tricky to read.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. Raising eyebrows isn't a dead giveaway—it could just be a habit, or maybe they're genuinely surprised by what they're saying. And while they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact (which are common signs of deception), the absence of those tells doesn't *prove* they're honest either. Some people lie without showing obvious nervousness, especially if they're practiced. I also wonder if the context matters—like, if they're recounting something mundane, the lack of strong reactions might just be normal, not suspicious.  

Honestly, the behavior here doesn't scream "lying" to me. The steady gaze, nodding, and lack of fidgeting all lean toward someone being straightforward, but I can't rule out that they're just good at hiding it. It feels more like they're being genuine than deceptive, but I'd want more context to be sure. Like, if they were describing something wild or contradictory, I'd be more doubtful—but based on the video alone, it seems like they're telling the truth. Still, I'd hesitate to say "definitely" because humans are messy, and sometimes truth feels just as nervous as lies.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, but here's how I'm thinking about it. So, the person is nodding a lot while looking sideways instead of directly at whoever they're talking to—that feels a bit off to me. Usually, when people are being truthful, they tend to keep more eye contact, right? But I've also heard that some people naturally avoid eye contact even when they're honest, especially if they're shy or just not used to being on camera. They're not smiling or laughing, which is good—lying often comes with forced smiles or nervous laughter—but they're also not frowning or scowling, which would be more typical of deception. The awkward pauses with their mouth closed feel like they're thinking carefully, which could go either way: maybe they're rehearsing a lie, or maybe they're just being cautious with their words. 

What throws me off a little is the lip protrusion—like they're puckering their lips slightly. I've read that lip movements can be subtle signs of stress, but I'm not sure if that's reliable. It might just be a habit, like how some people do it when they're concentrating. And they're not doing anything else obvious, like touching their face or crossing arms, which are classic "nervous liar" tells. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so the absence of those signs doesn't prove they're truthful. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of discomfort—like frequent blinking, fidgeting, or avoiding eye contact *more* intensely. But here, the sideways gaze is there, but it's not extreme, and the nodding feels like they're trying to engage, just not with direct eye contact. Maybe they're just uncomfortable with the situation, not lying. Honestly, I'm leaning toward truth because the behavior doesn't scream deception, but I can't rule out that the sideways look is a sign they're not fully comfortable. It's hard to say for sure though—people are complicated, and context matters. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% confident. It just doesn't *feel* like the classic "lying" behavior I've seen before.

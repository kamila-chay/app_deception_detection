Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not. Let me walk through what I'm seeing. They're definitely not smiling or laughing—no real smile, just a slight tightness at the corners of their lips, which might be more like a forced expression than a genuine one. Their eyebrows are furrowed, and they're blinking a lot, which usually makes me think someone's stressed or maybe trying to think of what to say. That *could* point toward lying, right? Like, when people lie, they sometimes get nervous and blink more. 

But then there's the eye contact thing. They're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which I've heard is a sign of truthfulness—liars often avoid direct eye contact. They also glance down and sideways a bit, but I've read that's not a solid indicator; some people just think that way when they're speaking, or it could be cultural. The head's turning to the side a little, but not shaking or nodding—just a natural tilt, I think. And their chin is moving up slightly, like they're leaning in a bit, which might just be concentration, not deception. 

The thing that makes me hesitate is the blinking and furrowed brows. Those *do* look tense. But then again, if they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs—like avoiding eye contact entirely, or a fake smile, or fidgeting with their hands. Here, they're not doing any of that. The hands are still, the posture's relaxed, and they're maintaining connection. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation, not lying. Like, maybe they're telling the truth but feel awkward about it, which would explain the blinking and the slight frown. 

I keep thinking, "But wait—could the tension be from lying?" Maybe. But the lack of other classic cues makes me lean away from that. People get nervous when they're being honest too, especially if they're worried about how they're being perceived. So honestly? I'm not 100% sure, but I'm starting to think they're probably telling the truth. The eye contact and absence of other "lie signs" feel more convincing than the blinking and frown, which could just be stress. Still, it's hard to say for sure without more context. I'd say it's a maybe, but leaning toward truth.

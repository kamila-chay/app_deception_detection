Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit of a toss-up for me. The person is smiling, which seems a little forced at times—like their lip corners are pulled up but their eyes don't really crinkle the way they would if it was genuine. They're also raising their eyebrows a lot, which I've noticed sometimes happens when people are trying to seem innocent or surprised, but it could just be them reacting naturally to what's being said. The frequent blinking stands out too; I've heard that people often blink more when they're stressed or lying, but it could also just be them being nervous about the situation, like maybe they're in an interview or something high-pressure.  

On the flip side, they're maintaining eye contact pretty steadily with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, and they're nodding along while they speak—like they're genuinely engaged. Their arms are open too, which feels like they're trying to seem approachable or trustworthy, not closed off or defensive. If they were lying, I'd expect them to avoid eye contact more or cross their arms, but they're not doing that.  

I keep going back and forth because the blinking and the slightly stiff smile make me lean toward deception, but the eye contact and open posture feel like they're trying to seem sincere. Maybe they're just really anxious about whatever they're discussing, and the "lying" cues are just nerves. Or maybe the smile is genuine, and the blinking is just them being tired. Without knowing the context—like what they're talking about or why they're being recorded—it's hard to say for sure. I'd probably say "maybe" they're not telling the whole truth, but I'm not confident at all. It feels like the kind of thing where you'd need more to go on, like hearing what they're actually saying or seeing how they act in other parts of the video.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and the person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous smiles. The only thing that stands out is that they're looking straight up a few times while talking. I've heard people say that looking up can sometimes mean someone's trying to recall something, which *might* be linked to lying since liars sometimes "construct" stories, but I've also read that this isn't a reliable sign at all. Like, people look up when they're thinking about anything—like trying to remember a phone number or solving a math problem. 

On the flip side, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely (gaze toward the person is false, but they're not *always* looking away), and they don't seem stressed or flustered. No rapid blinking, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed—that actually feels more like someone who's comfortable or just thinking clearly. If they were lying nervously, I'd expect more of those little tells, but there's nothing like that here. 

But then again, I know some people are really good at hiding it—they might not show physical signs because they're practiced or just naturally calm. Maybe they're telling the truth but the upward gaze is just how they think. Or maybe they *are* lying, but the lie is simple, so they don't get worked up. Honestly, it's hard to say either way. The upward look alone isn't enough to convince me they're lying, but it's also not strong evidence they're telling the truth. Without more context—like what they're saying or how they act in other parts of the video—I'd have to say I'm just not sure. It feels like maybe they're being honest, but I wouldn't bet on it based on this alone.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m not entirely sure, but I’m leaning toward the person probably being deceptive. They are smiling with their lip corners pulled up, which seems genuine at first—like a relaxed or slightly embarrassed smile—but the slight lip protrusion catches my attention as it could indicate some subtle discomfort. Their gaze is directed downward rather than at the person they’re talking to, which sometimes happens when someone is avoiding eye contact to hide something, though it can also mean shyness or thoughtfulness. The absence of typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting, blinking excessively, or touching their face adds complexity; usually, liars show some signs of tension, but I’ve also seen skilled deceivers maintain calm composure. So, even though the calmness and smile suggest truthfulness, that downcast gaze combined with the unusual mouth movement makes me lean toward thinking there might be some concealment going on here. It’s not a definitive case of lying, but overall, I’m inclined to suspect deception despite the lack of obvious red flags.

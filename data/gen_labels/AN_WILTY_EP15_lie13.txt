Looking at the clip, I’m trying to piece this together. They’re definitely maintaining eye contact with the person they’re talking to, which throws me a bit because I’ve heard people say liars avoid looking at you, but maybe that’s not always true. They’re shaking their head a couple of times—like a clear “no” gesture—and their arms are folded the whole time, which feels defensive. I’ve seen that posture before when someone’s trying to shut down a conversation or feels uneasy, so that’s making me lean toward them not being fully open.  

But then again, head shaking could just be them disagreeing with something in the conversation, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they’re saying “no, I didn’t do that” but it’s a straightforward denial, not deception. And arms folded? Honestly, lots of people just fold their arms when they’re comfortable or just thinking, not because they’re hiding something. I don’t see any of the classic “nervous” signs either—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no lip biting. If they were lying, I’d expect more of that stress, right? But I guess some people are really good at staying calm under pressure.  

The thing that keeps bugging me is that eye contact. If they were lying, I’d expect them to glance away or look down, but they’re holding it steady. That feels like it might actually point to truthfulness, but I’m not sure. Maybe they’re so practiced they’ve learned to fake the eye contact too. Honestly, it’s really hard to tell. I’d be inclined to say they’re probably not lying based on the calmness, but the folded arms and head shake make me pause. Maybe they’re just frustrated with the question, not hiding anything. I’d say it’s a maybe—could go either way, but I’m leaning slightly toward truthfulness because of the lack of stress cues. Still, I’d want to see more context before I’d be confident either way.

I'm not totally sure, but watching the clip, there's a mix of things that make me lean toward them not being entirely truthful, though it's really hard to say for certain. They kept tilting their head and moving it forward a lot—like, almost like they're trying to lean into the conversation too hard, which sometimes happens when people are rehearsing or being overly careful. Their gaze was mostly down, but still directed at the person they're talking to, which is a bit confusing because people who lie often look away or down, but here they're keeping eye contact while doing it. That makes me think maybe they're trying to seem honest while actually being nervous. Also, their palms were up the whole time, which usually signals openness or sincerity, but I've heard that liars sometimes do that to appear genuine, so it could be a red herring.  

On the flip side, though, the head tilting and side-turning might just be natural for them—some people do that when they're listening or thinking, not necessarily lying. The chin moving up and down could just be a little nervous habit, like fidgeting with their jaw, and not a direct sign of deception. Plus, the fact that they're maintaining eye contact while looking down might mean they're just being respectful or thoughtful, not deceptive. I've seen people who are really honest do similar things when they're trying to be careful with their words.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The head movements and gaze down feel a bit off, but the palms up and sustained eye contact are pulling me the other way. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're not outright lying, but they're definitely not completely relaxed—like, they might be hiding something or just really stressed about the situation. But I wouldn't bet money on it; it's way too ambiguous to call. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, and I'm overthinking it.

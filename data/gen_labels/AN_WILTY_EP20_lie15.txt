Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but the way they're holding eye contact the whole time feels a bit off for someone lying—like, most people who're being deceptive tend to look away or fidget, but here they're actually staring right at the person they're talking to the entire time. That makes me think they might be being truthful, because liars often avoid direct gaze to seem less credible, and there's nothing in the video that screams "nervous" like fidgeting or exaggerated movements. The slight head turn sideways is just a natural thing people do when listening, not something that stands out as suspicious.  

But then again, I guess it's possible they're just really practiced at lying—some people can keep eye contact while they're being deceptive, especially if they're rehearsed or confident. And maybe the lack of any visible stress cues (like blinking a lot or avoiding gaze) is exactly how they're *trying* to seem honest, so it could be a cover. It's hard to say for sure though, because without more context—like what they're actually saying or the situation—it's tough to tell if that steady eye contact is genuine or just part of the act. Honestly, it feels more like truth-telling based on what I see, but I wouldn't bet money on it. Sometimes the most "normal" behavior is the trickiest to read.

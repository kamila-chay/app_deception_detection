Honestly, while the person maintains steady eye contact and doesn't show typical signs of nervousness like fidgeting or looking away, which usually suggest truthfulness, these very behaviors could also be a deliberate effort to appear convincing. Some skilled liars are capable of sustaining eye contact and controlling their body language to avoid suspicion. The absence of stress cues might not indicate honesty but could instead be part of a practiced facade. Given these nuances and without more context, I lean slightly towards the possibility that the person might be deceptive, though it's not certain. The behavior is subtle and controlled, which can sometimes be more indicative of someone trying to mask the truth than someone outright telling it.

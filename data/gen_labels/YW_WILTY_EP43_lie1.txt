Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them possibly not being fully truthful. The thing that stands out to me is how they're looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—like, they're keeping eye contact, which is actually kind of unusual if someone's lying, since people often avoid eye contact. But then there's this little sideways glance they make every now and then, like their eyes drift off to the side for a second before snapping back. It doesn't feel like a natural, relaxed thing—more like they're trying to avoid focusing too hard on the person, maybe because they're uncomfortable.  

That said, I can totally see why someone might think they're being honest. They're not fidgeting, not smiling awkwardly, not blinking a lot—none of the classic "tells" people usually associate with lying. If they were nervous about something, they might not show it physically at all, especially if they're used to being put on the spot. Maybe they're just really focused on what they're saying, or maybe the sideways glance is just a habit—like, they always look away when they're thinking, even when they're telling the truth.  

I guess the tricky part is that deception doesn't always look the way we expect. If they're good at hiding it, they might not give off any obvious signs, which is exactly what's happening here. The lack of physical cues could mean they're calm and truthful, or it could mean they're suppressing their nerves so well that it's almost *too* controlled. Honestly, I'd need more context—like, what are they talking about?—to feel more confident. But based on just the behavior, that sideways glance feels a little off, so I'm leaning toward deception, even if I'm not totally convinced. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the conversation to be sure.

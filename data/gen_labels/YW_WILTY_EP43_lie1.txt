Based on the clip, I’m not entirely certain, but I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be less than truthful. What catches my attention is that they maintain direct eye contact most of the time, which is a bit odd since people who lie often avoid eye contact. However, they do occasionally cast a quick sideways glance, as if momentarily trying to look away before snapping back. This doesn’t come across as a relaxed or natural gesture; it seems more like a subtle attempt to avoid fully focusing on the other person, possibly because they feel uncomfortable.  

On the other hand, they don’t display many of the typical signs we associate with lying—their body language is steady, they don’t fidget or blink excessively, and their facial expressions don’t seem forced or awkward. It’s possible they’re just genuinely focused or that this sideways glance is a habitual behavior, unrelated to deception.  

The challenge is that deception doesn’t always show up in the ways we expect. Someone who’s skilled at hiding the truth might present very controlled behavior, which could explain the absence of obvious nervous cues here. Still, the combination of steady eye contact with those fleeting sideways looks strikes me as somewhat incongruous. Without more context—like knowing what they’re discussing—it’s hard to be sure, but I’m inclined to think they might be concealing something, even if I’m not fully convinced. It’s a situation where hearing the full conversation would help clarify things.

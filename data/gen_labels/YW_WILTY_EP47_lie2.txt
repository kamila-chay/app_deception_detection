Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m leaning toward the possibility that they might be lying, though I wouldn’t say I’m completely certain. They maintain steady eye contact and have open hands with palms up, which are typically signs of honesty and transparency. However, the repeated head shaking while speaking strikes me as unusual and somewhat inconsistent with straightforward communication. Usually, someone answering honestly might nod or pause, but shaking the head “no” while talking could suggest an attempt to deny or distance themselves from what they're saying, possibly indicating some discomfort or deception. 

Additionally, their overall stillness seems a bit stiff, which could be a sign of nervousness or trying to control their behavior to hide something. That said, it's also possible that the head shaking is just a natural expressive habit or a reaction to frustration about the topic rather than the truthfulness of their answer. The calmness in their face and absence of typical signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or fake smiles make it harder to be definitive. Deception can be subtle, especially if someone is practiced, and the mixed signals here make me inclined to suspect that they might not be entirely truthful, though I would hesitate to say so definitively without hearing their actual words. Overall, their behavior leans a bit toward deception, but it’s not an open-and-shut case.

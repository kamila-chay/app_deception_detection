Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those situations where the cues are kind of mixed up. On one hand, they're making steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. And their hands are open—palms up and arms spread out like they're being completely transparent. That's the kind of thing people often do when they're trying to seem trustworthy, so it makes me lean toward them telling the truth, at least at first glance.  

But then there's the head shaking. They keep shaking their head "no" while they're talking, which feels a bit odd. If they were just answering a question straightforwardly, I'd expect maybe a nod or a pause, but shaking the head while speaking? It kind of sticks out. Sometimes people do that when they're denying something they're not supposed to, like they're trying to emphasize "no" while still saying words that might not add up. And since the whole thing feels a little stiff—like they're holding themselves really still otherwise—I wonder if that's a nervous habit trying to cover something up.  

But here's where I second-guess myself: maybe they're just naturally expressive with their head, or they're shaking it in frustration about the question itself, not the answer. Like, maybe they're annoyed the topic came up, not lying about it. And the open hands? I've seen people do that when they're genuinely trying to explain something, not when they're hiding. It's hard to tell if it's a conscious "I'm honest" gesture or just how they move.  

Honestly, the lack of other classic "lying" signs—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or fake smiles—makes it confusing. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in their face or hands, but everything feels kind of calm except for that head shake. Still, I've learned that deception can be subtle, especially if someone's practiced. So while I'm not *certain*, the head shaking combined with the way they're holding themselves... yeah, I'd probably lean toward them not being completely truthful. But I'd be really hesitant to say for sure—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be certain. It's one of those cases where the behavior alone doesn't scream "liar," but it doesn't feel totally relaxed either.

Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching, but here's what stands out to me. The person is making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels a bit unusual if they're lying—most people I've seen who are deceptive tend to look away or fidget more, but here they're holding that gaze. That makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, at least initially.  

But then there's this odd head movement—like they're tilting their head back and forth a bit, and their chin is moving up and down too, almost like they're nodding but not really. I've seen people do that when they're thinking hard or trying to seem calm, but it also feels a bit forced? Like they're overcompensating. And the head moving backward a little—almost like they're pulling away subtly—makes me wonder if they're uncomfortable.  

On the flip side, though, they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" you'd expect: no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no fake smiles or avoiding eye contact. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* nervous energy, but this feels... quiet. Maybe they're just naturally stiff when talking, or maybe they're genuinely not stressed about what they're saying. I've known people who stay super still when they're telling the truth, especially if they're rehearsed or just very composed.  

The thing that keeps me second-guessing is that chin movement—it's so specific and repetitive. If it was just a natural gesture, it wouldn't stand out like that. But I also don't want to overread it; maybe they're just a head-tilter by nature. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The direct eye contact and lack of other nervous signs make me think they might be telling the truth, but that head movement *feels* off enough that I can't rule out deception entirely. It’s one of those cases where it’s hard to tell if it’s a habit or a sign. I’d say it’s probably truth, but I’d need to hear the conversation to be sure.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them being truthful. The thing that stands out most is how they're holding direct eye contact with the person they're talking to—like they're really engaged—and their gaze is consistently looking upward, not away or sideways. From what I've read before, people often look up when they're recalling genuine memories, like trying to picture something they actually experienced, which usually feels more natural than fabricating a story. And they're not doing any of those classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or smiling awkwardly—they seem pretty calm and focused, with just a slight raise of their eyebrows, which honestly could just be them reacting to what they're saying, not necessarily being nervous.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Raising eyebrows *can* sometimes signal stress or uncertainty, especially if it's repeated, and I know some people train themselves to look directly at someone when they're lying to seem more convincing. Plus, the fact that their gaze is up might not mean much on its own—it could just be their natural way of thinking, not tied to truthfulness. And yeah, the video doesn't show them doing anything obvious like covering their mouth or crossing arms, which might make it feel less suspicious, but absence of signs isn't proof of truth either.  

I guess what makes me more inclined to believe them is the combination: no defensive body language, consistent eye contact, and that upward gaze that fits with genuine recall. But I'm not going to say for sure—they might just be really good at hiding it, or the eyebrow thing might be a red herring. Honestly, it's hard to tell without knowing the context, but based on the cues I can see, it feels more like someone being honest than someone trying to pull something. I'd say the weight of what I'm observing points toward truth, but I'd want to hear more of the conversation to be certain.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tough to say for certain just from body language alone. They're looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time—that feels like it could be a sign of honesty, since people often avoid eye contact when they're being deceptive. And they're nodding along while they speak, which seems like they're genuinely engaged in the conversation, not trying to cover up something. But then there's the frequent blinking and those raised eyebrows—they look a bit tense, like they're maybe a little nervous about the situation, which could be because they're lying... or just because they're in an interview setting and it's stressful. I've seen people do that when they're just trying to remember details, not necessarily when they're being dishonest.

The head shaking is confusing me a bit too—it's a small, quick movement, not like a strong "no," so it might just be a habit or an unconscious gesture while thinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting a lot, but they're not doing that. They're not frowning or crossing their arms, which are things I'd watch for if I was suspicious. Actually, the fact that they're maintaining that steady gaze while nodding and speaking clearly makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I can't rule out that the blinking and raised brows might just be nerves from the camera or the topic being sensitive. It's possible they're lying but really good at hiding it, or they're just naturally a bit expressive. I think the balance tips slightly toward truth because the engagement cues (gaze, nodding) feel stronger than the nervous ones (blinking, eyebrows), but I'd need more context to be sure. Honestly, without knowing the full situation, it's easy to second-guess—people get nervous when they're being recorded, even when they're telling the truth. So yeah, I'd probably say they're likely telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

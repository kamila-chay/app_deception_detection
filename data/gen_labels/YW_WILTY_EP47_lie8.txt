Based on the video, I’m leaning slightly toward the idea that they might be lying. While they do exhibit some behaviors associated with honesty, like nodding and open palms, there are subtle cues that give me pause. The frequent sideways glances and the head tilting suggest they might not be entirely comfortable or fully engaged, which can sometimes be signs of deception. The upward chin movement also hints at a possible attempt to appear confident while feeling stressed underneath. It’s worth noting that they maintain eye contact much of the time and don’t show more obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact altogether, which complicates things. Still, those indirect looks and physical cues make me think there’s a chance they’re not being completely truthful. It’s not certain, but I would lean toward deception here rather than full honesty.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn on whether they're being truthful or not. They're nodding a lot while they talk, which usually feels like someone trying to show they're engaged or agreeing with what they're saying—like when people are being genuine in conversations. Their hands are open with palms up, which I've heard people say can signal honesty, like they're not hiding anything. And they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which makes me think they're trying to be open. But then there's this thing where they keep glancing sideways and tilting their head a bit to the side, like they're not fully locked in on the conversation. I've read that when people lie, they sometimes avoid direct eye contact or shift their gaze, so that sideways look feels a little off to me. Also, their chin moves upward a few times—like they're lifting it slightly when they speak—and I've noticed that can sometimes happen when someone's trying to seem confident but is actually stressed. 

On the flip side, though, if they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely, but they're not doing that. The nodding and open palms really make it feel like they're being straightforward. Maybe the sideways glances are just a nervous habit, not deception—some people do that when they're thinking or just naturally. And the chin movement? Could be nothing, like they're just adjusting their posture. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The video doesn't give me a clear "aha!" moment either way. I'd lean toward them telling the truth because the cues seem more consistent with openness (nodding, eye contact, palms up), but that sideways glance is nagging at me. Maybe it's just me overthinking it. I'd say it's probably not deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it either. It feels like they might be a bit nervous, but not necessarily lying.

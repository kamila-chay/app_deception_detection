From what I’m observing in the clip, there are a few subtle signs that make me lean toward the possibility that the person might be lying, though I can’t be completely certain. Their consistent eye contact generally suggests honesty, but the unusually frequent blinking stands out—this kind of response can sometimes indicate stress, which might occur when someone is trying to maintain a fabricated story. Additionally, their gaze shifts up and down during the conversation could point to them either recalling details or inventing information, making me slightly suspicious. The head tilting and open palms might be attempts to appear engaged and sincere, which some people do consciously when they want to seem trustworthy.

That said, they don’t display many of the more classic signs we often associate with deception, such as avoiding eye contact, nervous gestures, or fidgeting, which tempers that suspicion. The direct gaze could suggest truthfulness, but it also might be a way to convince the listener. It’s possible their blinking and movements are simply signs of nervousness or distraction rather than outright lying.

Overall, while there are no definitive red flags, the combination of these subtle cues makes me lean slightly toward thinking they might not be entirely truthful. It’s far from a sure thing, but if I had to guess, I would tentatively suspect some level of deception.

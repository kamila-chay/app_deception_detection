Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but watching the clip, I'd lean toward them not being entirely truthful—though I could easily see someone arguing the opposite. The most noticeable thing is how they keep their mouth closed during pauses, almost like they're deliberately holding back words, which feels a bit unnatural. It’s not just silence; there’s this awkward hesitation where their lips stay tight, and their chin actually dips down slightly when they’re speaking, like they’re bracing themselves. Then there’s the head shaking—it’s subtle but consistent, like a quick "no" motion while they’re talking, which usually happens when people are trying to push back against something they don’t want to admit. And their gaze? It flicks sideways a lot, not really meeting the other person’s eyes, even though they’re looking at them—like they’re distracted or avoiding direct contact.  

But here’s where I hesitate: maybe they’re just really nervous or tired. That chin movement could be a habit, not tension, and the sideways glance might just mean they’re thinking hard, not lying. Head shaking can be a cultural thing too—some people do it reflexively without meaning it. The lips being retracted (pulled back a bit) feels tense, but it could also be from concentrating on what they’re saying. I’ve seen people do all these things when they’re just trying to be careful with their words, not when they’re hiding something.  

Still, the combination of the forced pauses, the chin dip, and that repeated head shake—it all adds up to a vibe of discomfort that doesn’t quite match how someone would talk if they were being completely open. Like, if they were telling the truth, they’d probably relax more with their mouth or eyes. But yeah, it’s not a slam dunk. It’s easy to overread small gestures, so I wouldn’t bet money on it. If I had to guess, I’d say there’s a good chance they’re being deceptive, but I’d want to see more context before I’d call it certain.

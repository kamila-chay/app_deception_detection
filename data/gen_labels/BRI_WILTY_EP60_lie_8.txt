Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person is sitting there, and I notice they're raising their eyebrows a few times—like, not super dramatic, but definitely noticeable when they're answering something. And they shrug once, kind of like "I don't know" or "whatever." Their eyes are mostly looking right at whoever's talking to them, and sometimes they glance up a bit, like they're thinking. But they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting or anything like that. 

At first, I thought maybe the raised eyebrows and shrug could be signs of deception—like, people sometimes do that when they're trying to seem innocent or nervous. But then I kept watching, and it didn't feel *off*. Like, when they shrug, it seems natural, not forced. And they're actually making eye contact, which I've heard some people say is more common when someone's telling the truth, not lying. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more or seem tense, but they seem pretty calm. 

But here's where I'm stuck: maybe they're just a naturally expressive person. I've known people who raise their eyebrows a lot when they're thinking or being emphatic, not because they're hiding something. And shrugging? That's a common gesture for uncertainty, but it doesn't *have* to mean they're lying—it could just be how they respond to a question they're not sure about. Like, maybe they genuinely don't know the answer, and the shrug is just them saying "I don't have that info." 

I also wonder if the "gaze up" part is a clue. Some people look up when they're recalling something, which could be neutral or even truthful—like they're trying to remember. But if they were lying, I'd expect them to look down or away more often, not up. So that actually feels like it might lean toward truthfulness. 

On the flip side, though, the fact that they're not smiling or laughing at all—especially if the conversation is casual—could feel a bit stiff. But I don't think that's a strong indicator; some people just don't smile when they're focused. And they're not doing any obvious signs like touching their face or blinking a lot, which are sometimes linked to lying. So it's not like they're fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which would make me more suspicious. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. It's possible the raised eyebrows and shrug *are* deceptive cues in this context, but they don't *feel* deceptive to me. Maybe it's just their normal way of talking. I'd need more context—like what they're actually saying—to be confident. Without that, I'm just going by body language, and that stuff is super unreliable. Like, I've seen people who are totally honest but look away when they're thinking, and others who lie with a smile. So yeah, I'm not going to say for sure, but I'd guess they're telling the truth, just because the cues don't add up to the "classic" deception signs I've heard about. Still, it's a maybe.

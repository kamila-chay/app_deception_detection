Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this one out—it's tricky because body language can be so ambiguous. What stood out to me first was how they kept looking directly at the person they were talking to, not avoiding eye contact, and they were nodding along while speaking. That feels like a good sign for someone being genuine—they're engaged, not hiding. Plus, their arms were open, palms up, and they weren't crossing their arms or doing anything closed-off, which usually makes people seem defensive or guarded. I've noticed in real life that when people are relaxed and telling the truth, they tend to have that open posture.  

But then I kept noticing their hands touching their head and scratching a bit—like, they'd rub their scalp or scratch their neck while talking. That *does* make me pause because people often do that when they're nervous, which you might associate with lying. I wondered if maybe they were just uncomfortable in the room, or maybe they had a headache, but I can't rule out that it might be a sign of stress. It's hard to tell without knowing the context.  

Also, the fact that they didn't smile or frown at all felt a bit odd to me at first—sometimes liars force smiles to seem friendly, but here there was no smile at all. That could actually work in their favor, like they're being serious and not trying to manipulate the vibe. But then again, some people just don't smile much when they're being honest, so it's not a clear indicator either.  

I guess I'm leaning toward them being truthful because the open body language and eye contact seem more consistent with honesty than the scratching. But I'm not 100% sure—maybe the scratching was just them being restless, or maybe the situation was making them anxious for a totally unrelated reason. Honestly, I'd want to hear more of what they're saying before I'd feel confident either way. It feels like the *overall* vibe is honest, but those little nervous gestures make me hesitate a bit. I'd say it's probably truthful, but I'd need more to be certain.

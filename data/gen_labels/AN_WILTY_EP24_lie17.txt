Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those tricky cases where it's hard to tell just from body language alone. On one hand, they're making pretty consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which often feels like a sign of honesty to me—like they're trying to be open. And they're nodding along while they talk, which usually reads as agreement or engagement, not something I'd expect from someone who's being deceptive. I also don't see any of those classic "lie signs" like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or nervous smiles, which makes me lean toward thinking they might be telling the truth.  

But then there's the thing with the eyebrows—they're raised pretty noticeably, and that's got me second-guessing. I've heard people say raised eyebrows can be a sign of stress or even deception, like when someone's trying to "sell" a story. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, though? Like, maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question or just thinking hard, and it's not about lying at all. I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're concentrating or even when they're being sarcastic, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

The other thing is, they're not doing any of the other stuff I'd associate with lying—no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no hands covering their face. If they were being deceptive, I'd expect more of those nervous habits, but they seem pretty calm overall. Still, I know that some people lie really smoothly without any of those cues, so the absence of "obvious" signs doesn't prove they're telling the truth. It's just... confusing. Like, if I had to guess, I'd say it's more likely they're being honest, but I wouldn't bet money on it. Honestly, without more context—like what they're actually saying or the situation—it's really hard to call. I'd need to hear the conversation to feel confident.

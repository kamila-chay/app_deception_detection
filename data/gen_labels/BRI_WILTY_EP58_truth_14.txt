Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth—not because it's obvious, but because some of their gestures seem to align more with honesty than deception. For instance, they keep their palms up the whole time, which usually signals openness or sincerity, and their gaze stays mostly directed at the person they're talking to, which isn't typical for someone who's being deceptive. They also don't have that nervous fidgeting or avoiding eye contact that often goes with lying.  

But there are a few things that make me hesitate. They're raising their eyebrows a lot, which can sometimes mean skepticism or surprise, but I'm not sure if it's relevant here. More confusing is that exaggerated eye-closing—they close their eyes really wide and slowly a couple of times while speaking. I've seen people do that when they're trying to remember something clearly (which could be truthful), but it also feels a bit forced, like they're overcompensating for something. And then there's the head shaking—they're shaking it back and forth while talking, which usually means "no," but they're clearly saying something positive or confirming something. That *could* be a red flag if it's inconsistent with their words, but maybe they're just gesturing naturally, like when they're emphasizing "I'm sure about this" while shaking their head.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, you'd expect more signs like avoiding eye contact (but they're looking at the person most of the time), or nervous gestures like covering their mouth (which they're not doing). The fact that they're not smiling or laughing also feels neutral—not the kind of "stiff" behavior you'd see when someone's hiding something. Honestly, the palms-up gesture is the strongest clue for me; it's such a classic "I'm being honest" signal that it outweighs the odd eye-closing and head shake for me. But I'm still not totally convinced—maybe they're just a very expressive person, or the head shake is just a habit.  

All in all, it feels like they're being truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. The behavior doesn't scream "lie," but it's not textbook truth either. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words they're saying first.

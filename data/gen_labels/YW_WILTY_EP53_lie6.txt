This situation is a bit complicated, but based on what I'm observing, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might not be fully truthful. They don't display the usual signs often associated with lying, like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or forced smiles. Instead, their minimal blinking suggests they might be trying to maintain control over their expressions. 

However, two particular cues stand out: the noticeably raised eyebrows and the slight upward tilt of the chin. Raised eyebrows can signal genuine surprise, but they can also indicate stress or an attempt to appear more open than they really are, especially if the movement seems sudden or exaggerated. The chin tilt is less common and can be a subconscious effort to project confidence or assertiveness, which might be a way to mask uncertainty or discomfort. 

On the other hand, these behaviors might simply be their natural way of communicating or a response to a sensitive topic. There are no clear secondary signs of deception like awkward pauses, lip biting, or shifting in their seat, which makes it more ambiguous. While it's possible they’re just nervous or cautious with their words, the combination of raised eyebrows and chin movement does raise some suspicion for me.

Overall, while I can’t say with certainty that they're lying, I do lean slightly toward the possibility that there is some deception involved. The absence of other typical cues makes it tricky, but those subtle expressions suggest they might be trying to manage how they come across, which often happens when someone isn’t being entirely forthcoming.

Hmm, this is tricky—I'm not 100% sure, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person in the video doesn't seem to be doing any of the classic "liar tells" like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or forced smiles. In fact, they're not even blinking much, which often happens when people are focused or trying to control their expressions. But there are two things that stand out to me. First, their eyebrows are raised pretty noticeably—like they're surprised or maybe trying to look innocent. I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes signal stress or an attempt to appear "open" when you're not, especially if it's sudden. Then there's the chin moving upward, like they're tilting it slightly up while speaking. That's not super common, and I've read that some people do that when they're trying to seem more confident or assertive, which could be a subconscious way to cover up uncertainty.  

But here's why I'm not totally convinced they're lying: raised eyebrows can also just be genuine surprise, like if someone said something unexpected. And that chin movement? It might just be their natural way of talking—some people do that when they're emphasizing a point, and it doesn't always mean deception. Plus, there's no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no shifting in their seat... all the stuff you'd expect if they were hiding something. Honestly, it feels more like they're just a little nervous about the topic, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're trying to be extra careful with their words because it's a sensitive subject, but that doesn't automatically mean they're lying.  

I guess it's a toss-up. If I had to lean, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive because of those two cues, but I'm really not sure. It could just be them being expressive. The absence of other signs makes me hesitate—most people assume liars fidget or look away, so the fact that they're not doing that might actually suggest they're being truthful. But I've also heard that good liars don't show those obvious signs, so it's not a guarantee. Yeah, I'd say it's ambiguous either way, but if I had to guess based on what I see, I'd lean slightly toward them not lying... though I'd definitely want to see more context. It's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're talking about.

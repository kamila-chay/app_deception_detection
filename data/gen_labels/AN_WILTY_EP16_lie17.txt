Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone who seems pretty composed overall—they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels natural, and they're nodding along like they're engaged. That part actually makes me lean toward them being honest, because liars often avoid eye contact or nod too much to seem cooperative. But then there's that subtle chin movement—like they're pulling their chin down slightly, almost like a little tuck, and it keeps happening. I've heard that can sometimes be a nervous habit, like when someone's trying to hold back a reaction or is stressed about what they're saying. 

But wait, I'm not sure if that's really a sign of lying. Maybe they're just naturally fidgety with their jaw, or maybe they're tired and it's just a habit. The video doesn't show any other classic signs—no forced smiles, no weird blinking, no looking away a lot. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those cues, but they're mostly neutral. On the flip side, some people are really good at hiding deception, so maybe they're just very calm under pressure. I keep circling back to that chin thing—it's the only thing that stands out as odd, but it's so subtle. Like, it could be anything: maybe they have a sore neck, or they're just thinking hard. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The direct gaze and nodding feel like they're trying to be sincere, but that chin movement nags at me. I wouldn't bet money on it either way, but if I had to guess... I'd say maybe they're not lying, but I'm not totally confident. It's hard to tell with just a few small movements, especially when the rest of their behavior seems so relaxed. Like, if this were a real conversation, I'd probably ask a follow-up question to see if they're consistent, but from the video alone? I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to check again.

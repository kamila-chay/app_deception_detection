Looking at this clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, but it's tricky. What stands out to me is how often they're raising their eyebrows—like, really noticeable, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying. And their gaze keeps drifting sideways, not really locked on the person they're talking to. At first glance, those might seem like classic "lying" signs—people often think raised eyebrows mean they're hiding something, and looking away is a tell for deception. But honestly, I've seen enough videos where people do that when they're just thinking hard or processing info, not necessarily lying. Like, when I'm trying to remember a detail, I often look sideways or up, and I'm not lying about it.  

The thing that makes me lean toward them being truthful, though, is how *calm* they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no weird lip movements, no obvious signs of stress like rapid blinking or covering their mouth. If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy—like hands moving around or avoiding eye contact entirely. But here, they're just... still, except for those eyebrows and the sideways glance. It feels more like they're genuinely trying to recall something or think through their answer, not fabricating it.  

That said, I can't rule out lying completely. Maybe they're really good at controlling their body language, or maybe the sideways gaze is a cultural thing—some people naturally look away when speaking, even when being honest. Or perhaps the eyebrow-raising is a habit unrelated to deception, like they're just emphasizing a point. It's also possible they're lying but not stressed enough to show physical signs, which happens sometimes.  

Honestly, I'm stuck between "probably truthful" and "hard to say." The absence of other tells makes me think they're not lying, but I don't want to overrule the eyebrow thing. If I had to guess, I'd say they're telling the truth, but I'd feel way more confident if they were making direct eye contact or had a more relaxed posture. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of nervous energy I'd associate with deception. Still, I'd want to see more context before I'd bet on it.

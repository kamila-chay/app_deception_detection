Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I can see why someone might think they're lying. The person's face seems pretty tense—I noticed they had a pretty clear frown going on, like their eyebrows were pulled down and their mouth corners were pulled down too, not smiling at all. And they kept nodding while answering, which feels a bit... off? Like, sometimes when people are being deceptive, they over-nod to seem more convincing, especially if they're trying to sound sincere. It didn't look natural, just a steady, maybe a little too frequent nod while they were talking.

But honestly, I'm not totally convinced. That frown and downturned lips could just mean they're genuinely upset about the topic, right? Like, maybe they're stressed or frustrated about what they're being asked, not necessarily lying. I've seen people get that tight-lipped look when they're just trying to hold back their reaction to something awkward, not when they're hiding something. And the nodting—could be a habit for them, or maybe they're just trying to be polite while answering a question they don't want to get into. I mean, people nod all the time when they're listening, so it's not a sure sign.

The thing is, there's no other stuff you'd usually see with lying, like avoiding eye contact (they weren't looking at the camera much, but that's not a clear indicator either) or fidgeting with their hands. So it's not like they're doing all the classic "tells." It's just this one combination of a frown and that nod. I guess if I had to lean toward something, it feels a bit suspicious because the expression doesn't match the nod—like, if they were being truthful, I'd expect their face to look more neutral or maybe even agreeable, not so closed-off while nodding. But I could totally be wrong. Maybe they're just having a bad day, or the question made them uncomfortable. It's really hard to say for sure without more context. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it without seeing more of the conversation.

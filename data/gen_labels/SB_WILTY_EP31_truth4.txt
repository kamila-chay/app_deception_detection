Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. On one hand, the person is maintaining direct eye contact with the person they're speaking to most of the time—that's usually a strong sign of honesty, like they're trying to be open. They're also nodding their head forward and backward while speaking, and tilting it sideways a bit, which feels natural to me, like they're genuinely engaged in the conversation, not rehearsing a lie. The way they're moving their head seems relaxed, not forced.

But then there are some things that make me pause. Their eyebrows are raised quite a bit, and they're blinking way more than usual—like, really frequently. I've heard that people sometimes blink more when they're stressed or trying to think of something, which could be a red flag. And they're opening their eyes wide a lot, almost like they're trying to emphasize something. I wonder if that's just their natural way of speaking, though—some people do that when they're being earnest, not necessarily deceptive. 

The side glances they make (gaze sideways) also stand out a bit. I've seen that in people who might be a little nervous, but it could just mean they're thinking or looking at something in the room. Honestly, it's hard to tell without hearing the words they're saying. Maybe they're just a very expressive person, or maybe they're in a situation where they're genuinely uncomfortable but still telling the truth. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact completely or covering their mouth makes me lean toward truth, but those raised eyebrows and blinking are nagging at me. 

I wouldn't feel confident saying "definitely lying" based on this alone. It feels like the behavior is mixed—some signs point to truth, some could be stress, but nothing screams deception. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation to be sure. It's not clear-cut either way.

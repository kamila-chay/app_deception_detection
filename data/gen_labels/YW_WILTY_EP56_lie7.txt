Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean slightly toward them not being entirely truthful. The head shaking while they're scowling and looking directly at the camera feels off—like they're disagreeing with something they're saying, which sometimes happens when people are trying to convince themselves or others of a lie. The chin moving upward while they're speaking also seems a bit tense, like they're bracing themselves, which I've noticed before in people who are being evasive. And the fact that they're maintaining eye contact while doing all that? That's a bit confusing because some people who lie avoid eye contact, but others overcompensate by staring too hard. It could just be them being frustrated with the question though—they're scowling like they're annoyed, not necessarily like they're fabricating something.  

On the other hand, the lack of smiling or laughing makes me pause. If they were being completely honest about something, they might relax a bit more, right? But then again, maybe they're just naturally serious or the question was stressful. The gaze upward could also mean they're trying to recall details—like they're genuinely thinking hard—instead of lying. And the head shake? That could just be a reflexive "no" to a question they're answering, not necessarily a sign of deception. I've seen people do that all the time when they're explaining something calmly.  

Honestly, it's really hard to say without more context. The behaviors here are subtle and could go either way. If I had to guess, I'd say deception is possible, but it's not a slam dunk. It feels like they're trying too hard to seem sincere (hence the intense eye contact and chin movement), but that could just be their natural reaction to being questioned. I'd want to hear the actual conversation before I'd feel confident either way.

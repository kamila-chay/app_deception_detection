While I can't be completely certain, the cues in the video suggest that the person might not be entirely truthful. The combination of head shaking alongside a scowl and direct eye contact seems somewhat contradictory—it's as if they're internally disagreeing with what they’re saying, which can be a sign of someone trying to convince others of something untrue. The upward chin movement also comes across as tense or guarded, which I've often noticed in individuals who are being evasive. Their intense eye contact adds another layer of complexity; while some liars avoid looking at the camera, others may overcompensate by staring intently, which might be what's happening here. 

However, some of these signs might also be explained by frustration or stress, rather than outright deception. The lack of smiles or laughter might suggest unease, but that doesn’t automatically mean dishonesty—they could just be naturally serious or irritated by the questioning. Additionally, the upward gaze could indicate genuine effort to recall information, and the head shake might simply be a reflexive response rather than a deliberate denial. 

Given these mixed signals, it's difficult to be definitive, but my impression leans toward the possibility that they are not fully truthful. It seems plausible they might be trying a bit too hard to appear sincere, which makes me suspect some level of deception, though I wouldn’t say it’s conclusive without more context.

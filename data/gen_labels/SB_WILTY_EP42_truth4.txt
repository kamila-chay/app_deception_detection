Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person's main thing that stands out is that they keep looking down and turning their head sideways a little—like they're not making direct eye contact. On the surface, that *does* make me think, "Hmm, maybe they're avoiding something," because I've heard people say that looking away or down can be a sign of lying. Like, when someone's nervous or hiding something, they might not want to meet your gaze. But then I pause and think: that's not always true. I've seen people look down when they're just thinking deeply, or maybe they're shy, or even just naturally have a habit of not staring straight ahead. Like, if they're recalling a memory or feeling a bit emotional, looking down could just be them processing, not lying.

What's interesting is they don't seem to have any other nervous tells—no fidgeting, no weird smiles, no excessive blinking, nothing like that. If they were lying, I'd expect to see *some* of those little stress signals, right? Like if they're making up a story, their body might give them away. But here, they're just... calm. Quiet. Just looking down and shifting their head a bit. It almost feels like they're being genuine because they're not acting out of character. Like, if they were lying, they might be trying too hard to seem relaxed, but this feels natural, not forced.

But then I wonder—could it be that they're a really good liar? Some people don't show any signs at all, so maybe they're just good at hiding it. Or maybe the context matters: if they're talking about something heavy or sad, looking down makes sense without it being a lie. I mean, I can't see the conversation, so I'm just guessing based on what I see. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but the lack of other "red flags" makes me lean toward them telling the truth. It feels less like deception and more like someone just being thoughtful or a bit reserved. But I could totally be wrong—I've been fooled before by people who looked calm but were lying, and vice versa. So yeah, I'd say "probably truthful" based on this, but I'd want more context to be certain. It's hard to say for sure with just this clip.

Looking at this clip, I'm actually a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. On one hand, they're making really steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is marked as true—and they're raising their eyebrows a few times. I've heard that sometimes people who are lying might overdo the eye contact to seem honest, like they're trying too hard to prove they're truthful. And the eyebrow raises could feel a bit nervous or forced, like they're anticipating a question or trying to seem surprised by what they're saying. That *could* point toward deception, especially since they're not showing other typical "truth" cues like smiling or frowning, which might make them seem overly controlled.

But then again, I'm not sure. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows—some people do that when they're concentrating or trying to be engaged, and it's not necessarily a sign of lying. And the fact that they're maintaining eye contact without any fidgeting or awkward pauses (no frequent blinking, no lip movements, nothing like that) actually feels pretty calm and composed. Truth-tellers can be really steady too, especially if they're confident in what they're saying. I've seen a lot of people who tell the truth without any visible tension—they just sit there focused, maybe with a slight eyebrow lift, and it's totally normal. 

Honestly, it's hard to tell just from this alone. The lack of obvious "lie" tells (like avoiding eyes or touching their face) makes me lean slightly toward them being truthful, but the intense eye contact and eyebrow raises are nagging at me. I'd probably want to hear more of the conversation or see if they react differently to specific questions before I'd feel confident. Without more context, I'd say it's a maybe—not clear-cut either way, and I'd hesitate to call it a lie based on this alone. It just feels like they're being careful, but careful could mean either truth or deception.

Watching the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky to tell just from body language alone. They're blinking a lot, which sometimes makes people think of deception, but I know blinking can happen for so many reasons, like bright lights or just being tired. They have a slight smile with their lip corners up, and their arms are open, which usually feels like someone being relaxed or honest—not like someone trying to hide something. But then their gaze is sideways a lot, not looking directly at the person they're talking to, and that *could* be a sign they're not fully engaged or maybe avoiding the question. I've seen people look away when they're thinking or just uncomfortable, though, not necessarily lying. The arms open thing really stands out as positive, though—most liars tend to cross their arms or seem closed off. Still, the blinking and sideways glance are nagging at me. Honestly, I'd lean toward them telling the truth because of the open posture, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want more context, like what they’re actually saying, to feel confident. Maybe they’re just naturally a bit fidgety.

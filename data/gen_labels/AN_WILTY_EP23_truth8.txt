Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people can act differently when they're nervous or just being natural, but here's what stands out to me. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like, they're looking right at the person they're speaking with most of the time, which often feels like a sign of honesty, not lying. But they also glance down occasionally, which I've noticed people do when they're thinking or recalling something, so that might not mean anything suspicious. Their head is tilted a bit, which seems like they're engaged or listening, not like they're hiding something. 

Now, the thing that really makes me lean toward them telling the truth is how calm they seem. There's no fidgeting—no hands rubbing, no tapping, no avoiding eye contact with sudden shifts. They don't seem tense or overly rehearsed. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more nervous habits, like playing with their hair or looking away a lot, but they're just... there. Calmly talking, with that natural head tilt. But then I wonder—could they be really good at hiding it? Like, some people don't show physical signs of lying at all, so maybe they're just not the type to fidget. Or maybe the "gaze down" is because they're concentrating, not because they're lying. 

I also keep thinking about the opposite: if they *were* lying, why would they make consistent eye contact? Usually, liars look away more, but here they're holding it. The head tilt feels like they're processing what they're saying, not dodging. Still, I know people can fake eye contact too, so I can't be 100% sure. But based on what I'm seeing—no red flags like nervous gestures, steady gaze, and that engaged head position—I'm leaning toward them being truthful. It just doesn't *feel* like they're hiding anything. That said, I'm not totally confident because body language isn't foolproof, and maybe they're just really good at staying calm. But honestly, the absence of those classic "lying" cues here makes me think they're probably telling the truth.

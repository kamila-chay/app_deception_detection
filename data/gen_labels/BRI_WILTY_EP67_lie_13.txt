Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. So I'm watching someone who's got this open posture—palms up and arms kind of spread out, like they're being transparent. That usually makes me think they're trying to seem honest, right? And they're smiling a bit, which could be natural, but sometimes people force smiles when they're not comfortable. The thing that stands out to me is how they're looking sideways the whole time—like, not at the camera or whoever they're talking to, just off to the side. I've heard that when people avoid direct eye contact, it can be a sign they're not being fully truthful, though I know it's not a hard rule. Some people just have a habit of looking away when they're thinking or feeling shy, so it might not mean anything.

But then again, they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" stuff—no fidgeting with their hands, no weird blinking, no crossing arms or anything. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a bit more tense, but they seem pretty calm. The smile and open arms might actually be a sign they're trying to put me at ease, which could be part of being deceptive, but it could also just be their normal way of interacting. I keep thinking, maybe they're just not used to being on camera, or maybe they're genuinely trying to explain something without being defensive. 

I'm not sure if the sideways glance is a red flag or just them being awkward. Like, if they were telling the truth, they might look down or away while recalling something, but if they're lying, they might avoid eye contact to not get caught. It's hard to say without more context. The lack of other nervous cues makes me lean toward them being truthful, but that sideways gaze is nagging at me. Honestly, I'd probably need to hear what they're saying or see more of the interaction to be confident. Right now, I'm torn—it could go either way, but I'd say it's *slightly* more likely they're not lying, just... a bit off-kilter with their gaze. But I'm definitely not 100% sure.

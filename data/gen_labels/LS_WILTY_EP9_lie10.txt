Looking at the video, I’m honestly not 100% sure if they’re lying or not—it’s really hard to tell just from body language alone. What stands out is how they keep their mouth closed during pauses, like they’re really thinking before speaking, and their lips are pulled down slightly, which feels a bit tense. They’re also nodding along while looking directly at the person they’re talking to, and they tilt their head a couple of times, which seems engaged, not nervous. Then they shrug at one point, which usually feels like they’re being honest or unsure, not deceptive.  

But here’s why I’m leaning toward deception: the pauses with their mouth shut feel a little *too* deliberate—like they’re holding back words instead of just hesitating naturally. People who’re telling the truth often have more fluid speech, even if they’re thoughtful. And that downward lip pull? It could just be them being serious, but it also reminds me of how some people look when they’re hiding something. Plus, the head tilting and nodding might be attempts to seem cooperative, like they’re trying to convince someone.  

On the flip side, though, the direct eye contact and the shrug make me doubt it. Truth-tellers often maintain gaze to seem credible, and shrugs are usually a sign of "I don’t know" or "I’m being honest," not lying. Maybe they’re just naturally quiet or stressed about the topic—like if they’re answering something sensitive, they might pause more and look serious without lying.  

Honestly, I think it’s a toss-up. The behaviors aren’t screaming "liar," but they’re not screaming "truth" either. If I had to guess based on this clip alone, I’d say *maybe* deception, but I’d want to see more context—like what they’re actually saying or if they’ve been consistent in other interactions. Body language alone is tricky; it’s easy to misread someone’s stress as deception when it’s just them being careful. I’d need more to feel confident either way.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there aren't a ton of obvious tells, but here's what stands out to me. They're not doing anything that screams "lying" to me—like no fidgeting, no excessive blinking, no nervous smiles or frowns. Instead, they're looking up and sideways a lot, which I've heard some people say happens when someone's trying to recall something honestly, like they're mentally searching their memory. And they're shaking their head once or twice, which in context seems like a natural "no" or "not sure" gesture, not like a forced, anxious head movement. 

But I can see why someone might second-guess it. Head shaking *could* be a sign of discomfort, right? Like, if they're lying, they might shake their head to dismiss something. And the sideways gaze—some people might think that's avoiding eye contact, which is often linked to deception. But I've also seen people look sideways when they're just being thoughtful or trying to engage with the conversation, not hide anything. Plus, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely; they're shifting their gaze, which feels more like a normal part of speaking than a sign of guilt. 

The thing that makes me lean toward "truth" is how calm they seem overall. There's no tension in their face, no lip biting, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck. If they were making it up, I'd expect more little tells—like that "mouth closed" thing where people hesitate, but they're not doing that. It just feels... relaxed. Like they're just answering a question without a lot of extra energy. 

Still, I'm not 100% sure. People can be really good at hiding nervousness, and maybe the head shake is just a habit. But honestly, the absence of all those classic "lying" cues—combined with the natural-looking gaze shifts—makes me think they're probably being honest. I'd say it's more likely truth than not, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those cases where the "nothing happening" is actually the strongest signal.

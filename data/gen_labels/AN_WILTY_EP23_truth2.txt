Hmm, based on what I'm seeing here, it's a bit tricky to call either way, but I'm leaning toward them being truthful. They're smiling naturally while they talk, and their eyebrows are raised like they're genuinely surprised or engaged—like when someone hears something unexpected but positive. They're also keeping direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels more authentic than avoiding it, and they're nodding along while keeping their palms open, which feels like an unconscious sign of openness. No fidgeting or awkward pauses either, which sometimes happen when people are scrambling for lies.  

But honestly, I can't be 100% sure. Some people smile really hard when they're lying to seem friendly, and raising eyebrows could just be nervous habit, not surprise. Palms up is often seen as "honest," but I've seen people do that on purpose to *look* trustworthy even when they're not. And the smile here is a bit tight—like it's there but not quite reaching their eyes? Maybe it's just their natural expression though. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, like darting eyes or fidgeting with their hands, but I don't see that. It feels like they're just calmly sharing something, maybe even a little excited, which matches the raised eyebrows.  

Still, it's hard to rule out the possibility they're just really good at hiding it. But given what's actually *visible*—no red flags like avoiding gaze or tense body language—it seems more likely they're telling the truth. I'd say "truth" is the safer bet here, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be absolutely sure.

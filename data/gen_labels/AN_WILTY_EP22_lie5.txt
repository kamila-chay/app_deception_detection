Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where it's hard to tell just from body language alone. The person doesn't seem to be doing any of the usual "tells" people expect, like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or nervous smiles. Instead, they keep looking down and to the side, and their head is tilted slightly sideways—like they're not quite meeting the camera's gaze. That makes me think maybe they're uncomfortable or trying to avoid engagement, which *could* hint at deception, but honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just thinking hard or feeling shy, not necessarily lying.  

I mean, I've heard a lot about liars avoiding eye contact, but I've also read that's not always true—some people actually stare too much to seem honest. Here, the gaze is down and sideways, which feels more like they're distracted or processing something, not necessarily hiding. And the fact that they're not doing anything else nervous—no quick blinking, no hands fidgeting, no awkward pauses—makes it feel like they're actually calm. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, but this seems... quiet. Maybe they're just not used to being on camera or they're genuinely recalling something.  

On the flip side, though, the sideways head tilt and downward gaze *do* feel a bit off for a straightforward conversation. Like, if they were telling the truth, they might look more neutral or toward the speaker, right? But then again, maybe they're just tired or the lighting's bad, and their eyes are naturally downcast. I'm really torn because the behavior isn't screaming "lie," but it also doesn't feel like a clear "truth." It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. Honestly, I'd lean toward *maybe* deception just because the gaze feels deliberate, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It’s probably a toss-up, and I’d want to hear the audio to make sense of it.

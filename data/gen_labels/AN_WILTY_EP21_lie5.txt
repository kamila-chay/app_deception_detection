Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful, but it's a bit tricky. They're nodding quite a bit while speaking, which usually feels like a sign of agreement or engagement—something you'd expect from someone telling the truth. They also keep their eyes mostly on the person they're talking to, which often suggests honesty (since liars sometimes avoid eye contact). But then there are these little things that make me pause: they raise their eyebrows a few times, almost like they're trying to seem surprised or extra attentive, and their lips look pulled back slightly, like they're holding something in. It’s subtle, but I’ve heard that tense lip movements can sometimes signal nervousness—maybe they’re rehearsing what they’re saying or feeling uneasy about the topic.  

On the flip side, they don’t seem fidgety at all—no hand movements, no shifting around, which is actually a bit reassuring. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of physical stress, like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely. The fact that they’re maintaining eye contact while nodding feels genuine, not forced. It’s possible they’re just naturally expressive or a bit anxious about being recorded, not necessarily lying.  

Honestly, I’m not totally sure. The eyebrow raises and tight lips could be red flags, but they’re so minor and could easily be explained by something else—like they’re genuinely surprised by the question or just not used to being on camera. Without hearing the actual words, it’s hard to weigh it all. I’d lean toward them being truthful, but I wouldn’t bet on it. It’s one of those cases where the body language doesn’t scream "lie," but it’s not a clear "truth" either. If I had to guess, I’d say probably not lying, but I’d want more context to be confident.

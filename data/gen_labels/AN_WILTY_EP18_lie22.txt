Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it’s actually a bit tricky. The person is smiling quite a bit, and their lips are pulled up in a way that looks natural, not forced. They’re also keeping steady eye contact with whoever they’re talking to, which usually makes me think someone’s being straightforward, since people often avoid eye contact when they’re hiding something. Plus, they’ve got their palms facing up, which I’ve heard is sometimes seen as an open or honest gesture—like they’re not hiding anything. There’s no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no signs of nervousness like scratching or covering their mouth. That part makes me lean toward them being truthful because it doesn’t match the usual "lie signs" I’ve heard about.

But then I think, maybe they’re just really good at hiding it. Some people practice not showing nervous habits when they lie, so the lack of those signs might not mean anything. And that smile—while it looks genuine—could also be a way to seem friendly while still being deceptive. I’ve seen people fake a smile to soften the blow of a lie, especially if they’re trying to sound convincing. The palms up thing might even be a bit of a red herring; I’ve read that some cultures interpret that gesture differently, or it could just be a habit. And honestly, I’m not sure if the smile is *actually* genuine—sometimes people smile to seem calm when they’re stressed, which could be the opposite of truth-telling.  

All in all, the behavior doesn’t scream "deception" to me, but it doesn’t scream "truth" either. The absence of classic nervous tells is notable, but it’s not proof. I’d be cautious about jumping to conclusions either way. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s more likely they’re being honest based on what I see, but I’d want more context—like what they’re actually saying—to feel confident. It’s one of those cases where the video just doesn’t give enough to call it a clear lie, but it doesn’t rule it out either. Hard to say for sure without hearing the words they’re saying.

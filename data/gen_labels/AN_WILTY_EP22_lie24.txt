Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit of a toss-up. They're laughing and smiling (lip corners up), which usually makes me think someone's trying to seem friendly or relaxed, but I've also heard that people sometimes laugh nervously when they're being deceptive, so that could be a red herring. They keep their gaze mostly on the person they're talking to, which is interesting because I've always assumed liars avoid eye contact, but here they're looking down occasionally—maybe they're thinking or feeling uncomfortable, but it could just be how they naturally speak. The chin moving upward is a bit odd too; it feels like they're trying to seem confident or even a little defensive, but I don't know if that's a reliable sign. On the flip side, they're not doing anything super obvious like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or seeming overly tense, which sometimes makes me lean toward them being truthful. But then again, the laughter stands out—genuine laughter usually involves the eyes crinkling or being more spontaneous, and this feels a bit forced to me. Honestly, it's tough to say without knowing the context of what they're saying. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're trying too hard to seem calm. I'd probably hesitate to call it deception right away, but it's not completely off the table either. If I had to guess, I'd say it's possible they're lying, but I'm not at all certain—there are just too many ways this could go either way.

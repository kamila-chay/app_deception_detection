Watching the clip, I'm really trying to piece this together. The person seems pretty tense—I noticed they're frowning a lot, especially with those eyebrows pulled down, and they're blinking way more than usual. That kind of frequent blinking often happens when someone's stressed or trying to hold themselves together, which makes me lean toward thinking they might be hiding something. They also keep turning their head sideways while still trying to look at the person they're talking to, like they're shifting their gaze but not fully avoiding it. And that chin moving downward? It feels like a small, almost involuntary sign of discomfort or defensiveness—like they're physically pulling back from the conversation.  

But here's where I get stuck: stress can come from so many places. Maybe they're just nervous about the whole situation—like if they're in an interview or being asked a tough question they genuinely don't know the answer to. The fact that they're still making eye contact (even if it's mixed with sideways glances) feels a bit off for someone who's *definitely* lying; most people who are deceptive would avoid eye contact more consistently. And they're not doing any of the classic "liar" stuff like smiling too much, covering their mouth, or fidgeting with their hands—those are things I'd expect to see more if they were being deceptive.  

I keep going back to the blinking and the frown. Those are strong indicators of internal stress, but stress doesn't always mean deception. Maybe they're just exhausted, or the question made them feel bad about something they *are* telling the truth about. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect more of those "tells" like lip movements or avoiding eye contact entirely, but they're not doing that. It's a tough call. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure—they seem uneasy, but I can't rule out that it's just a normal reaction to a tough question. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's also totally plausible they're just stressed about something else. I'd need more context to feel confident either way.

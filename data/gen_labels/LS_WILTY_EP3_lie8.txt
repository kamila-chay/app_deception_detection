Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's kind of a toss-up. The person keeps raising their eyebrows, which I've noticed can sometimes happen when someone's trying to seem surprised or is nervous, but it's also just a common expression people use when they're thinking. Their chin is moving up and down a lot, like they're sort of nodding to themselves without actually nodding, and they keep looking down and sideways instead of directly at the person they're talking to. That makes me lean a little toward deception because when people lie, they often avoid eye contact or glance away, but... I've also seen people do that when they're just trying to remember something or feel a bit awkward, not necessarily because they're hiding something.  

On the other hand, there's a lot that *doesn't* look like a classic lie. They're not smiling or laughing in a forced way, which sometimes happens when people are faking it, and they're not fidgeting with their hands or touching their face—those are things I'd expect to see more if they were stressed about lying. Their head is turning sideways a bit, which might seem like they're trying to distance themselves from the conversation, but it could just be how they naturally move when they're talking. Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think it might just be their normal way of speaking—like they're a bit shy or just really focused on what they're saying, not that they're being dishonest.  

I keep going back and forth because the cues here are so mixed. If I had to guess, I'd say it *feels* like they might be hiding something, but I can't rule out that they're just nervous or distracted. The thing is, I've learned that people often misread these things—like, someone who's naturally expressive might look "guilty" even when they're telling the truth, and someone who's calm might be lying without giving anything away. So yeah, I'm not confident at all. It's probably not a clear-cut case, and I'd need more context to feel sure.

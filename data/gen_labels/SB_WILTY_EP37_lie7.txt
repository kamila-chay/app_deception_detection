Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out based on the video alone, and it's a bit tricky. The person seems to be doing a lot of subtle head movements—like tilting their head to the side and turning it sideways a few times, which I've noticed people do when they're thinking hard or trying to appear engaged. Their eyebrows are raised quite a bit, which sometimes happens when someone's nervous or surprised, but it could also just be their natural expression when they're listening. Then there's the chin thing—they keep moving it up and down, almost like they're swallowing or adjusting their jaw, which feels a bit off. It's not something I see people do casually, so that makes me wonder if it's a nervous habit tied to the situation.

On the other hand, they're looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually suggests honesty, and they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact in a way that screams deception. They also don't have any of the classic "tells" like fidgeting, covering their mouth, or over-the-top smiles. The gaze shifting down and sideways could just mean they're processing what's being said, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're trying to remember something or feel a bit uncomfortable, but it doesn't always mean they're hiding something.

The thing that sticks with me is that chin movement—it feels repetitive and unnatural for the context. If they were just being relaxed, it probably wouldn't happen so consistently. But then again, maybe they have a habit of doing that when they're focused, or it's just a quirk of their body language. Without knowing what they're talking about or the full conversation, it's hard to say if it's tied to the content. I'm leaning toward thinking they might be hiding something, but I'm not totally sure because there's no clear evidence like a forced smile or obvious avoidance. It could just be them being a bit anxious, which doesn't mean they're lying. Honestly, it's one of those cases where you'd want to see more of the interaction or hear what they're saying to feel confident. I'd say it's possible they're being deceptive, but I wouldn't bet on it without more context.

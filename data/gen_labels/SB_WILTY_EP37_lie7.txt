Based on the video alone, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't say for certain. The repeated subtle head movements—tilting and turning—along with the fairly consistent chin adjustments, strike me as somewhat unusual and possibly indicative of nervousness tied to deception rather than just casual body language. While raised eyebrows could mean surprise or attentiveness, combined with the other cues, they add to a sense of unease.

They do maintain eye contact in a way that might suggest honesty, and there are no overt signs like fidgeting or covering the mouth that are classic deception tells. However, some of the gaze shifts downward and sideways might hint at discomfort or an attempt to process fabrications rather than just recall or hesitation. The chin movements in particular stand out as repetitive and unnatural in context, which makes me suspect there might be something being concealed.

Still, without hearing the full conversation or knowing more about the situation, it’s difficult to be definitive. It’s entirely possible these behaviors are nervous habits or quirks unrelated to dishonesty. But weighing the subtle inconsistencies and the overall impression, I tend to think there’s a stronger chance they’re not being fully truthful, even if the signs aren’t overwhelmingly clear.

From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're smiling consistently—like a genuine, relaxed smile where the corners of their mouth lift up naturally—and they're mostly holding eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of openness. I also notice they keep their head up and don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding eye contact with nervous gestures like scratching or covering their face. The occasional glance down might just be them thinking or emphasizing a point, not necessarily hiding something.  

That said, I know smiles can sometimes be fake, especially if someone's trying to seem friendly while lying. And while they're not showing classic "nervous" signs like blinking a lot or looking away a lot, some people are really good at masking stress—maybe they've practiced this or just have a calm demeanor. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any of those tells, so the absence of fidgeting doesn't *prove* they're truthful, just that they're not acting nervous.  

Honestly, it's tricky. The behavior leans toward truthfulness—smiling while making eye contact, no obvious signs of stress—but I can't rule out that they're just a skilled liar. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it feels like they're being honest, but I'd want more context to be sure. Like, what are they talking about? If it's a simple, personal story, the calmness makes sense. If it's something high-stakes, I'd be more skeptical. But from the video alone, it seems like they're not lying.

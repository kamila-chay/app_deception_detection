Looking at this clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. On one hand, they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze directly towards the interlocutor the whole time—which usually leans toward truthfulness. Most people who lie tend to avoid eye contact or glance away, so that's a point in their favor. They're also not doing any of the obvious nervous tells: no fidgeting, no forced smiles, no blinking a lot, nothing like that. If they were trying to cover up something, I'd expect at least a few of those micro-expressions or gestures to show up.  

But then there's that chin movement—downwards, like they're subtly tucking it in. I've heard that sometimes when people are stressed or being deceptive, they'll make small chin adjustments, almost like they're trying to hide something or brace themselves. It's not a huge thing, but it's the only physical cue that's actually happening here. It's possible they're just adjusting their posture, but it stands out because everything else is so calm.  

Honestly, it's confusing because the direct eye contact feels like a strong sign of honesty, but that chin movement is nagging at me. Maybe they're a really good liar who's controlling their body language, or maybe the chin thing is just a coincidence. I'm leaning a little toward deception just because that downward chin feels off in a way the other cues don't—like they're holding something back even if they're not showing it outwardly. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it; it's really hard to tell with just this. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation first.

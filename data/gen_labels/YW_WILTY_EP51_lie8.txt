Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure—there's just not much to go on here. The thing that stands out most is how steady their eye contact is. They're looking directly at the camera the whole time without shifting their gaze, which honestly feels a bit unusual for someone who might be lying. I've heard the myth that liars avoid eye contact, but from what I've read, it's actually the opposite—truth-tellers often hold more consistent eye contact, especially in natural settings. Since they're not darting their eyes away, blinking a lot, or fidgeting with their hands or face (all those other behaviors are marked as "False" in the details), it seems like they're pretty calm and composed. That kind of calmness usually makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying, which could mean they're being honest.

But then I keep second-guessing myself because I know some people who lie *deliberately* make strong eye contact to seem credible—they practice it, like they're trying too hard to convince you. So maybe this isn't natural at all, and they're just being overly rehearsed. The video doesn't show any nervous tics or micro-expressions either, which is weird because I'd expect some sign of deception if they were lying, like a forced smile or a slight hesitation. But honestly, some people are just naturally calm under pressure, so it could just be their personality. Like, maybe they're a very composed person, or they're used to being on camera, so the lack of tells doesn't necessarily mean truth—it might just mean they're good at hiding it. 

I guess the biggest thing is that there's nothing *obviously* off about their behavior. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of discomfort. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a tiny bit of tension—like a raised eyebrow or a quick glance away—but there's none of that. Still, I can't rule out that they're just really good at pretending. Without hearing what they're saying or seeing the context, it's hard to tell. My gut says it's probably truth, but I'd want to hear the actual story before I'd feel confident about it. It's one of those cases where the absence of "lies" might mean truth, but it's not definitive.

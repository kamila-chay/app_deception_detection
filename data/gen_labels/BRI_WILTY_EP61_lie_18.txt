Looking at the clip, I'm honestly not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what stands out to me. The person smiles a few times during the response, which is the only clear behavior I notice—not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact (they seem to be looking at the camera directly), and no signs of nervousness like rapid blinking or tense gestures. At first glance, that smile makes me lean toward "telling the truth" because when people lie, they often seem stiff or overcompensate with unnatural expressions, but this smile just looks... relaxed. Like they're genuinely answering without stress.  

That said, I'm not ruling out deception entirely. Sometimes people fake smiles when lying to seem friendly or to mask discomfort, especially if they're practiced at it. If they're trying to appear calm while lying, that forced smile could actually be a tell. And honestly, the *absence* of obvious nervousness is weird for a lie—most people at least blink a bit more or shift in their seat. But maybe they're just really confident in their story, or this isn't a high-stakes lie where they'd feel anxious.  

I keep circling back to the smile though. If it were a genuine, warm smile (like they're recalling something pleasant), it’d point to truth. But if it’s a tight, brief grin that doesn’t reach their eyes? That’s trickier. The video doesn’t show enough detail to tell, though. Without more context—like what they’re being asked about—it’s hard to say if that smile fits the moment. Maybe they’re just happy to be answering, or maybe they’re trying too hard to seem cooperative.  

Honestly, I’d say it’s a toss-up. The lack of classic "lie" tells makes me doubt it’s deception, but I’m not confident. People lie in all sorts of ways, and some are really good at hiding it. If I had to guess, I’d lean toward truth *because* they seem so calm, but I’d want to see more of the conversation first. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need to hear the words they’re saying to really judge. So yeah—I’m not sure, but it doesn’t *feel* like deception to me.

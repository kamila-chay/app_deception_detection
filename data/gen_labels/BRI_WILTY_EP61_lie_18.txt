Looking at the clip, I’m not entirely convinced the person is telling the truth. While they do smile a few times and maintain direct eye contact without obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or rapid blinking, these behaviors alone don’t necessarily indicate honesty. In fact, the smile, which at first might seem relaxed and genuine, could be a practiced or forced expression meant to mask discomfort or project calmness. Some people are quite skilled at faking friendliness to appear truthful, and the absence of typical nervous cues might actually suggest they are deliberately controlling their behavior to avoid revealing deceit. 

The smile itself is somewhat ambiguous—without clear signs that it reaches the eyes or feels warm and spontaneous, it’s hard to interpret. Given this uncertainty and the lack of additional context, there’s a reasonable chance that the person is not being fully forthcoming. While they could be confident or the situation might not be high stakes, the combination of controlled demeanor and potentially insincere smiling leans me toward suspecting deception, even if I can’t be completely sure. Overall, I’d say it’s more likely they are not telling the truth than the other way around, based on the subtle cues present.

This is a bit complicated, but leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. They seem calm and maintain steady eye contact, which could suggest honesty, but that alone isn't definitive. The slight lift of the chin, while subtle, might indicate a defensive stance or an attempt to appear more confident, which can sometimes be a sign of deception. Their lack of nervous habits like fidgeting or face-touching could mean they’re simply composed, but it could also mean they’re disguising their true feelings well. While their behavior doesn’t scream "lying," some skilled deceivers can remain calm and focused to avoid giving off typical tells. Without more context, it’s hard to be certain, but based on these subtle cues, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they may not be entirely truthful.

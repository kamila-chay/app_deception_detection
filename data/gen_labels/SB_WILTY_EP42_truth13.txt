Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though it's really tricky to say for sure. They're nodding while looking down at the ground, which is a bit unusual because people usually make eye contact when agreeing, but maybe they're just thinking carefully about what they're saying. I noticed they raised their eyebrows a couple times too, which often happens when someone's surprised or processing something, not necessarily when they're lying. And they never seem to fidget or avoid eye contact completely—they actually look at the person they're talking to sometimes, which feels genuine.  

But here's where I'm hesitating: sometimes people who are lying *do* look down when they're recalling a story, especially if they're trying to "remember" details. And the way their chin moved down while they spoke—it could be a nervous habit, like swallowing or clearing their throat, but it also *might* be a subtle sign of discomfort. I also wonder if the head turning sideways was just them shifting position naturally, not avoiding the camera.  

The thing that makes me doubt it's a lie is how calm they seem overall. No fake smiles, no awkward pauses where their mouth is closed, no hands covering their face or rubbing—those are the classic "lie tells" I've heard about. If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just naturally quiet when they're being honest.  

Honestly? I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not going to swear on it. It just feels... less forced than most "lying" behavior I've seen. Like they're just being thoughtful, not crafting a story. But if I had to bet, I'd say they're telling the truth—not because it's obvious, but because nothing *really* feels off. Still, I'd want to see more context to be sure.

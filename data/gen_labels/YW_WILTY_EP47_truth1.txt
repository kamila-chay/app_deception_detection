Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's not super clear-cut. They're doing a few things that make me lean toward truth, but I can see how someone might think otherwise. First off, they've got those eyebrows raised *and* furrowed at the same time—like they're really trying to piece something together in their head. That doesn't scream "lying" to me; it feels more like they're concentrating hard, maybe recalling details. And they keep looking up, which I've heard some people do when they're accessing memories, not making things up. I've read that people often look up when they're truthful because it's linked to how we process information, so that’s a point in their favor.

Then there's the frequent blinking. Yeah, that *could* signal stress or lying, but honestly, I've seen people blink like that when they're just nervous about being recorded, not necessarily lying. Like, if I were answering a tough question on camera, I'd probably blink more too. And they're not doing any of the obvious "lie signs"—no lip biting, no avoiding eye contact (they're actually looking away, but not like they're dodging), no fidgeting with their hands. The head tilting seems like they're engaged, not deceptive. 

But here's where I second-guess myself: maybe the blinking and the furrowed brows are just signs of anxiety about being accused of lying? Like, if they *are* lying, they might be stressing out about getting caught, which could explain the blinking and the intense expression. And the gaze up—some experts say that's a lie tell too, depending on context. I'm not sure if it's the same thing here. 

Honestly, the thing that sticks with me is how *calm* they seem otherwise. No crossed arms, no shrugging, no awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words. It just feels like they're trying to be honest but are struggling to articulate it, which happens when people are telling the truth about something complicated. But I'm not 100% sure—I've been fooled before by people who were really good at hiding it. So yeah, I'd lean toward them being truthful based on what I see, but I'd want to hear the full context before I'd be confident. It feels like they're being genuine, but I'd hesitate to say "definitely not lying" because those little cues can be tricky.

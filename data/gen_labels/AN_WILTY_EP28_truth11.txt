Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain—there's just enough ambiguity that it could go either way. What stands out is how calm they seem overall. They're actually making consistent eye contact with the camera (which they're looking at directly most of the time), and even when they glance down occasionally, it doesn't feel like they're avoiding it—they seem focused, like they're thinking through their answer. That's interesting because I'd expect someone lying to look away more often or seem distracted, but here they're holding that gaze while still processing. 

The thing that really makes me hesitate is that they don't have any of those classic "nervous" tells—no fidgeting, no raised eyebrows, no lip biting or quick blinking. Normally, if someone's lying, I'd expect at least a few of those micro-expressions to show up, even if they're trying to hide them. But here, their face is pretty neutral, and their body language is relaxed—no crossed arms or tense hands. That feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying, which usually points to truth. 

But I can see why someone might doubt it. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it—some people practice staying calm when lying, so the lack of tells could be a red herring. Or maybe they're just naturally quiet or thoughtful, and the occasional glance down is just them gathering their thoughts, not hiding something. I've seen people who tell the truth but look down when they're trying to recall details, like when they're explaining something specific. It doesn't always mean deception. 

Honestly, the most convincing part for me is the combination: they're not avoiding eye contact (which is a big sign of lying in many cases), and they're not showing any stress cues. If this were a lie, I'd expect at least a little tension—like a flicker of a frown or a quick hand movement. But there's nothing like that. It just feels... steady. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's possible they're a smooth liar, or maybe they're just a naturally calm person who happens to be telling the truth. Either way, it doesn't scream "lying" to me.

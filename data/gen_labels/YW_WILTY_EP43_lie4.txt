Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. Watching the clip, the person's posture stands out to me—arms wide open, palms facing up, and they're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That feels like the opposite of what I'd expect from someone lying; open gestures usually signal confidence or honesty, not deception. I've seen people who are nervous about lying often cross their arms or avoid eye contact, so the fact they're relaxed and engaged like that makes me lean toward them being truthful.  

But then there's the frequent blinking. It's pretty noticeable, and I know some people blink more when they're stressed or trying to think of a lie. I wondered if that might be a sign they're not being completely straightforward. Like, maybe they're rehearsing their words or feeling uneasy about what they're saying. But then I thought, "Wait, I blink a lot when I'm just tired or concentrating too," so it could just be a nervous habit unrelated to lying.  

The other thing is the lack of any other classic 'lying' cues—no fake smiles, no fidgeting, no avoiding the gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those micro-expressions, but they're just... calm. Actually, that calmness feels a bit suspicious to me now—some people who lie try *too hard* to seem relaxed, like they're overcompensating. But honestly? The open posture feels more genuine than the blinking. It's not a perfect match for either truth or deception, but I keep coming back to the arms and palms. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet my paycheck on it. There's just enough ambiguity to make me second-guess. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need to see more of the conversation to be sure.

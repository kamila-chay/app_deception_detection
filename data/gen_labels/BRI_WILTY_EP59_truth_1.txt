Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. At first glance, they're not doing any of the obvious "liar" things—no nervous smiles, no forced laughter, no weird blinking or lip biting. That makes me lean toward them being genuine, but I can see why someone might second-guess it. 

What stands out to me is how they're looking at the person they're talking to—gaze toward interlocutor is true, so they're making eye contact, which usually suggests honesty. But they're also looking down a lot, which sometimes people do when they're lying to avoid direct eye contact. Wait, but the description says gaze toward interlocutor *and* gaze down are both true, so they're not avoiding eye contact—they're just glancing down while still engaging. That feels more like someone who's thinking carefully or being serious, not deceptive. 

Their eyebrows are raised and furrowed at the same time—that’s weirdly specific. Raising eyebrows often shows surprise or interest, but frowning eyebrows usually mean confusion or focus. Together, it might just mean they're processing what they're saying, not lying. And their lips are retracted (pulled back), which often happens when people are being earnest or concentrating, not when they're trying to hide something. 

On the flip side, the head tilting is a bit of a red flag for me—sometimes that’s a sign of uncertainty, like they’re not fully sure about what they’re saying. But then again, head tilting can also just mean they’re listening attentively or trying to understand. And the lack of any "nervous" gestures—no hand rubbing, no fidgeting—really works in their favor. Liars often have more physical tells, so the calmness here feels more like truth. 

I keep circling back to the eye contact and absence of classic signs. If they were lying, I’d expect more of those little "I’m hiding something" cues—like avoiding eyes or fidgeting. Here, they seem steady, even if a bit intense with those eyebrows. The gaze down might throw me off if I didn’t see the direct eye contact, but since they’re still engaging, it probably just means they’re thoughtful. 

Honestly, I’m not 100% sure, but based on what I’m seeing, I’d lean toward truth. It doesn’t *feel* like deception to me—the behavior seems consistent with someone being honest but maybe a little hesitant or deep in thought. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re telling the truth, but I’d still want to hear more context to be sure. It’s not screaming "liar," and the absence of tells is pretty telling itself.

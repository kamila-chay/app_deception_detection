Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty engaged while speaking—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels natural rather than forced. They're nodding along as they speak, like they're genuinely following the conversation or emphasizing points, and there's that slight head tilt that often comes with listening or thinking carefully. I don't see any of the classic "nervous" tells people sometimes associate with lying—no frowning, no awkward pauses where their mouth's shut tight, no frantic blinking or covering their face. They're just... calm. Like they're comfortable with what they're saying.  

That said, I'm not going to pretend I'm a lie detector. Sometimes people who *are* lying can look super relaxed if they're practiced, or maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows and head movements. I've seen folks raise their eyebrows when they're trying to seem innocent, not just when they're telling the truth. And the nodding? Could be habit, not necessarily agreement. Like, some people just nod without even thinking about it, whether they're lying or not. The head tilt too—it's common for people to tilt their heads when they're trying to appear friendly or interested, which could be part of a performance, even if they're not lying.  

Honestly, though, the absence of stress cues feels more telling here. If they were making it up, I'd expect at least a flicker of hesitation or something like lip biting, but there's nothing like that. They're just speaking plainly, with those little natural gestures that seem to match what they're saying. It doesn't *feel* like they're putting on a show. But yeah, I can't rule out the possibility that they're just really good at hiding it. I mean, we've all seen people who seem totally chill while lying, right? So I'd lean toward them being truthful based on what I'm seeing, but I'd still want to hear the full context before I'd be *sure*. It just looks like someone who's comfortable with their story.

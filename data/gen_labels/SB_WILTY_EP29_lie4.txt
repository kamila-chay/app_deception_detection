Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure, but there are some things that make me lean toward them not being completely straightforward. They're nodding while they talk, which usually feels like agreement, but their gaze keeps flicking sideways instead of staying steady on the person they're talking to—that feels a bit off to me. Like, when people are being genuine, they often look at the other person more consistently while they're speaking, even if they're thinking. Here, the sideways glances seem like they're avoiding direct eye contact, which can sometimes happen when someone's not being truthful.

Then there's their mouth and eyebrows—those are confusing. Their eyebrows are furrowed (frowning), but their lips are doing this weird thing where they're pulled both up and down at the same time, like they're trying to hold a smile but also frowning? And they're puckering their lips out a bit while pulling them back in. That combination of facial expressions just seems tense and unnatural, like they're trying to control their face but it's slipping. I've seen people do that when they're nervous about something, which could be because they're lying, but it could also just be them being really anxious about the situation regardless of whether they're being honest.

On the other hand, I keep thinking maybe they're just really stressed or uncomfortable about the topic, not necessarily lying. The head moving backward a little and the side-turning might just be a habit they have when they're thinking, not a sign of deception. And they're actually looking at the person sometimes, which some people do when they're trying to seem honest. The nodding also feels like it could be genuine agreement with what they're saying, not a fake "yes" to cover something up. If they were lying, I might expect more obvious signs like a lot of blinking or fidgeting with their hands, but they're not doing that at all. 

Honestly, it's really hard to tell. The conflicting facial cues and the sideways glances stand out to me, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It could easily be just them being really nervous about the interview or the question. I'd say the signs point *slightly* toward deception, but it's not clear-cut at all—maybe 60-40 that they're not being fully truthful, but I'm definitely not certain. There are too many ways this could just be normal nervous behavior.

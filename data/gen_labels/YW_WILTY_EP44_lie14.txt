Hmm, looking at this video clip... honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty composed at first glance, which makes me pause because I'd expect more obvious signs if they were lying. They're maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's interesting because I've heard people say liars often avoid eye contact, but I guess that's not always true. They're also tilting their head a bit while speaking, and their eyebrows are raised. 

Now, raised eyebrows and a slight head tilt... those can sometimes show someone's trying to seem engaged or maybe even a little surprised, but they also pop up in deception studies as signs of cognitive load—like when someone's constructing a story. The lip corners are turned up a bit too, like they're forcing a smile, but it's not a full smile. I wonder if that's just them being polite or if it's a micro-expression of nervousness. 

But here's where I get stuck: they're not avoiding eye contact, they're not fidgeting, no blinking too much, no scratching. Those are all classic "lie signs" people talk about, but they're absent here. Maybe they're just naturally expressive? Or maybe they're good at hiding it. I've seen people who lie without any obvious tells—like they're just very calm under pressure. 

On the flip side, the head tilt and raised brows *do* feel a bit off for a natural conversation. If they were telling the truth about something straightforward, I'd expect more relaxed, open expressions. This feels... rehearsed? Like they're trying to seem friendly while holding something back. But then again, maybe they're just a very expressive person who tilts their head when they're thinking. 

I'm leaning toward deception just because of the combination—especially since the gaze is direct but the other cues (raised brows, slight lip upturn) don't quite match a relaxed, truthful moment. But I'm not sure at all. It could totally be a false alarm—maybe they're just excited about the topic, or the question caught them off-guard. The lack of other nervous signs makes me doubt it, though. 

Honestly? I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it. It feels like a maybe, not a yes. If I had to guess, I'd say "probably not," but the raised eyebrows are bugging me. Maybe I'm overthinking it. Gotta remember: humans are messy, and context matters way more than just a few facial ticks.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but watching this clip, I'm leaning toward them possibly not being entirely truthful—though I could easily be wrong. The first thing that stands out is how they're smiling and raising their eyebrows while they talk. Smiling during a tense moment can sometimes feel forced, especially if it doesn't match the rest of their expression, and the raised eyebrows make me wonder if they're trying to seem surprised or innocent. But then, they're also keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually goes against the "liars avoid eye contact" myth. That part actually makes me pause—I've seen people fake sincerity by staring right at you, but it could also just mean they're genuinely engaged.  

Their head movements are tricky too. They're leaning in a bit and tilting their head, which often feels like a natural gesture of interest or curiosity, not something you'd do when lying. But the chin moving downward? That’s the part that nags at me. I’ve heard that when people are uncomfortable or hiding something, their chin might drop slightly, like they're trying to shield themselves. It’s subtle, though—could just be them shifting position while thinking.  

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth, the smile and eye contact might just be them being polite or nervous in a normal way. People smile when they're trying to be friendly, and head tilting is super common in casual conversation. The fact that they’re not frowning, avoiding gaze, or overdoing gestures (like rubbing hands) also feels less like classic deception cues. But then again, some liars are really good at masking it—maybe they’re rehearsed or just calm under pressure.  

Honestly, it’s a toss-up. The eye contact and head tilting lean toward honesty, but the smile and chin movement make me question it. I’d say if I had to guess, I’d lean toward deception because the cues don’t quite add up to natural behavior, but I’d be really hesitant to say for sure. It’s the kind of thing where without more context—like the topic of conversation or their usual behavior—it’s almost impossible to tell. Maybe they’re just a little tense about the question.

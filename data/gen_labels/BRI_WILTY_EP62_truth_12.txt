Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I can see how someone might second-guess it. The person isn't making eye contact with the camera at all; they're just looking straight up, like they're thinking hard about something. That actually feels pretty natural to me—when people recall real memories, they often look away or up, not straight at the person asking. I've noticed that in interviews before, where the person seems calm and focused on remembering, not faking.  

But here's where it gets tricky: sometimes liars *also* look up to "think" of a story, right? Like, they're not actually recalling something—they're making it up. So I can't rule that out entirely. What really stands out to me is how *still* they are. No fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of tension—like rubbing their hands or avoiding the camera more aggressively. But they're just sitting there, gaze fixed upward, like they're genuinely trying to remember. That calmness feels more truthful to me than deceptive.  

On the flip side, though, maybe they're just really good at hiding it. Some people don't show nervous tells at all, even when lying. Or maybe they're not lying *about* the thing in the video, but just not feeling comfortable—hence the gaze up, not down or away. I mean, I've been in situations where I'd look up to gather my thoughts without lying, so it's not a perfect sign. But combined with the total lack of other "tells" in the clip, it feels more like they're being honest than not. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's just that the absence of red flags makes the truth seem more likely than the lie.

Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that this person might not be entirely truthful. The frequent blinking stands out—it’s noticeably more than what I’d expect in a typical conversation, almost as if they’re trying to avoid sustained eye contact. While blinking can be caused by dryness or tiredness, in this context it feels like it might be a sign of stress or discomfort, which sometimes aligns with deception. 

Their eye movements are a bit contradictory too. They do make some eye contact, which might suggest honesty, but they also look down and to the side several times. This behavior can indicate unease or the effort to fabricate, rather than simply thinking. While it’s true that people can look away when recalling information, combined with the other cues, it raises some doubt.

Overall, I wouldn’t be surprised if this person is not telling the whole truth. I’m not fully confident in this conclusion because these signs are not definitive on their own, but taken together, they lean me toward suspecting some level of deception. Without more context, I can’t be certain, but my impression is that they’re probably not being completely honest.

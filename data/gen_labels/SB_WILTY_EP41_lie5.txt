Hmm, this one’s tricky. I’m watching the clip, and honestly, I’m not totally sure. They’re doing a lot of head movements—tilting, turning sideways, moving forward and back—and their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently. That kind of restless head motion sometimes feels like nervous energy, like they’re trying to seem engaged but actually feeling off-kilter. And the sideways glances while still mostly looking at the person? That’s a bit odd. Usually, if someone’s lying, they’d avoid eye contact more, but here they’re not quite avoiding it, just glancing away occasionally. Makes me wonder if they’re rehearsing what to say or trying to gauge the other person’s reaction.

But then again, some people just move their heads a lot when they talk, no matter what. Like, maybe they’re naturally expressive, or maybe they’re just really thinking hard about the question. The eyebrows raising could be genuine surprise at being asked something unexpected, not deception. And they’re not doing the classic "liar signs"—no frowning, no awkward pauses, no lip movements, no avoiding eye contact altogether. If anything, the fact that they’re holding eye contact most of the time feels more like someone being straightforward, even if their body’s a bit restless. 

I keep circling back to the head movements though. It’s not like a typical nod or a casual tilt—it’s almost like they’re trying to *adjust* their posture to seem more relaxed, which sometimes happens when people are on edge. But then I think, *Wait, maybe they’re just tired or fidgety?* People do that when they’re just tired, not lying. It’s hard to tell if the chin moving up and down is part of that or if it’s a separate sign of internal conflict. 

Honestly, I’d lean toward them being truthful just because the eye contact is mostly there, but I’m not confident. The sideways gaze and head shuffling are nagging at me. Like, if they were lying, I’d expect more avoidance, but maybe they’re just bad at hiding it, or maybe they’re not lying at all. I’d need more context—like what they’re being asked about—to feel sure. Right now, it’s just a mix of stuff that could go either way. I’d say it’s probably not deception, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.

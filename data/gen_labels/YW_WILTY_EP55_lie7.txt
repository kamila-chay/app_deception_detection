Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit ambiguous. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, but I've also heard that some people use direct eye contact to seem more convincing when they're lying. Their eyebrows are raised the whole time too, which makes me think they might be trying to seem surprised or engaged, but that could just be their natural expression when they're paying attention. Honestly, I don't see any obvious nervous tells like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or over-the-top gestures—no heavy blinking, no lip biting, nothing like that. That part actually makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, because liars often have more physical signs of stress when they're trying to hold it together. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, and the raised eyebrows might just be a habit. I've also heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes signal skepticism or even deception, like when someone's trying to seem innocent while they're actually covering something up. Without knowing their normal behavior or the context of what they're saying, it's really hard to tell. If they were usually relaxed and now they're stiff with raised brows, that might be a red flag, but I can't tell from the video alone. So yeah, I'm stuck between thinking it's probably honest because they're looking at the person and not fidgeting, but I'm not ruling out deception either because the raised eyebrows feel a bit forced. It's one of those cases where the absence of "typical" lie signs might mean they're not lying, but it could also mean they're just really good at it. I'd need more context to feel confident.

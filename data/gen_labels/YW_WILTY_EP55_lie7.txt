Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't say for certain. They maintain direct eye contact throughout, which is often associated with honesty, but it’s also something people sometimes use deliberately to appear more credible when they’re not telling the truth. Their consistently raised eyebrows caught my attention too—it could be an attempt to appear surprised or engaged, but raised eyebrows have also been linked to subtle signs of skepticism or even deception, as if they're trying to mask something. While they don’t show typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or excessive blinking, this absence doesn’t necessarily guarantee honesty; some people are quite adept at controlling their physical cues. Without knowing their usual demeanor or the full context of what they’re discussing, it’s difficult to be sure, but the combination of forced-looking raised eyebrows and intense eye contact makes me suspect there could be some deception involved. I wouldn’t rule out their truthfulness entirely, but overall, I lean slightly toward them not being completely honest.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but I'll try to break it down the way I'd watch this video. So, the person is speaking, and I notice they're nodding a few times while they talk—like they're agreeing with what they're saying or trying to emphasize points. That feels a bit natural, not super forced, but I know people can nod when they're nervous too, so I'm not counting that as a clear sign. Their hands are open with palms up, which usually comes across as honest or open in my experience, but I've also seen people do that when they're trying to seem sincere, so it's not a slam dunk.  

Then there's the raised eyebrows—that's interesting. They do it a couple of times, especially when they're talking about something specific. To me, raised eyebrows often show surprise or skepticism, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're genuinely taken aback by what they're saying or recalling, not trying to cover up something. But I can see how someone might think it's a sign of deception, since it's a common "micro-expression" people associate with lying.  

The thing that sticks out most is the sideways glance—like they're looking off to the side instead of directly at the camera or whoever they're talking to. I've heard that avoiding eye contact can be a red flag for lying, but honestly? I've seen people do that all the time just because they're thinking, or maybe they're just not used to being on camera. It doesn't *feel* like a deliberate dodge to me—it’s more like they’re gathering their thoughts.  

On the flip side, they don’t seem tense: no frowning, no lip biting, no rapid blinking. They even have a small, natural-looking smile at points, which feels genuine. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of stress—like fidgeting or a forced smile—but this seems pretty relaxed overall.  

That said, I’m not ruling out the possibility they’re lying, because body language is so tricky without context. Maybe they’re just very calm under pressure, or maybe the sideways look is because they’re reading from a note off-camera. I’d need to see more of the conversation to be sure. But based on what I’m seeing, the cues don’t scream "lying" to me—they lean more toward someone being a bit thoughtful or nervous in a normal way, not deceptive. I’d probably say they’re telling the truth, but I’d still be hesitant to bet on it without more info. It’s just not clear enough to call it a lie.

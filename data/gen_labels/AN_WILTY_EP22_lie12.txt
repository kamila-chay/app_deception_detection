Looking at the video, the person seems pretty composed—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or weird facial expressions. They’re actually maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they’re talking to and nodding along consistently, which usually makes me think they’re engaged and trying to be believable. Like, when people are being truthful, they often match the conversation with nods and direct gaze to show they’re listening and being honest. The way they’re speaking seems smooth too—no awkward pauses or stammering, which sometimes happens when people are scrambling for a story.  

But then again, I’m not totally sold on that. I’ve heard that some really practiced liars *overdo* the eye contact and nodding to seem too sincere, like they’re trying to convince themselves as much as anyone else. Maybe they’ve rehearsed this part so much that it’s just automatic, and the calmness is actually a mask. Also, the fact that they’re not showing *any* of the typical "tells" we’d expect—like fidgeting or looking away—could just mean they’re really good at hiding it, not that they’re telling the truth. Honestly, it’s tricky because some people are just naturally calm in conversations, no matter what they’re saying.  

I’d lean toward them being truthful just based on how relaxed they seem, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. Like, if they were lying, they’d probably be *too* polished, and this feels a bit… effortless? But I’ve been wrong before—sometimes the most convincing liars look the calmest. Without more context, like what they’re even talking about, it’s really hard to say. I’d say it’s a maybe, but leaning slightly toward truth. Still, I’d want to hear the whole conversation before I’d feel confident either way.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—mostly because I don't see the usual signs that make me suspicious. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to, which feels like they're engaged and trying to connect, not avoiding eye contact like some people do when they're hiding something. Their head is moving forward a bit, like they're leaning in to listen or respond, which usually feels sincere in conversations. And they're raising their eyebrows a couple of times—maybe they're genuinely surprised or processing what's being said, not trying to fake a reaction.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. Raising eyebrows *can* sometimes look nervous or like they're trying to seem "innocent," and the way they glance down occasionally might make people think they're avoiding the truth. I've seen people do that when they're lying, so it's not a perfect sign. Also, the head turning sideways a bit—like they're thinking—could be interpreted as them gathering their thoughts, but some might read that as hesitation.  

That said, I'm not seeing anything that screams "lying" to me. No fake smiles, no frowning, no awkward pauses, no hands fidgeting or covering their mouth—those are the classic red flags I'd look for. The way they're holding their body is relaxed, and they're not making any exaggerated gestures that feel forced. If they *were* lying, I'd expect more of those nervous ticks, especially in a situation where they might be under pressure.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're talking about. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're just a calm person who doesn't get flustered easily. But based on what I'm watching, I don't have a strong reason to think they're being dishonest. It feels more like they're just having a normal, engaged conversation. I wouldn't bet money on it, but I'm not seeing evidence that they're lying either.

Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. At first glance, the person seems pretty calm—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiles. They're actually looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels a bit unusual for someone lying, since I've noticed that liars often glance away or seem distracted. But then I keep noticing they're raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really frequently, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying. That's the thing that's throwing me off.  

On one hand, the steady eye contact and lack of nervous gestures (no hand rubbing, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses) make me lean toward them being honest. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of discomfort, like shifting in their seat or looking down. But eyebrow-raising... that's tricky. Sometimes people do it when they're thinking hard, or even when they're trying to seem engaged to cover up a lie. It's not a classic deception cue, but it's not totally neutral either. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're rehearsing their answer and the raised brows are a habit.  

I'm also thinking about the context—if this is a casual conversation, the eye contact feels genuine, but if it's a high-stakes situation, the eyebrows might be a red flag. But honestly, the video doesn't give me much else to go on. No laughter, no scowling, no lip movements that seem off... it's all pretty neutral. So I'm stuck between "they seem calm and engaged, so probably truthful" and "that eyebrow thing feels like it might be a cover-up." I'd say it's a toss-up—I'm not sure, but I'm leaning slightly toward them being honest because the eye contact and lack of physical tension don't scream deception. Still, I wouldn't bet money on it. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'm not 100% convinced. It's just... weirdly quiet, you know? Like they're being careful, but not *too* careful.

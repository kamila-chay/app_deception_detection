Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video alone, since I can't hear what they're saying. But based on what I'm seeing... the person seems pretty calm. They're not smiling or laughing, which isn't a huge red flag for lying—some people just don't smile when they're being serious. What stands out is that they're nodding along while talking, which often happens when someone's genuinely engaged or confirming something they believe. Their arms are open too, which usually feels like an unconsciously open posture, not defensive. 

I notice they're looking down quite a bit and their chin is moving downward slightly—like they're thinking or recalling something. I've heard some people say downward gaze can mean lying, but honestly, I've also seen it in people who are just trying to remember details truthfully. Their head is also turning to the side a little while they speak, which feels natural, not like a nervous tic. And they're raising their eyebrows a bit—sometimes that's just emphasis when they're telling a story, not deception. 

But I should be careful here. The downward gaze *could* be avoidance, and the head turn might seem like they're trying to hide something. If they were lying, I'd maybe expect more fidgeting or lip movements, but they don't seem to be doing that. No awkward pauses either—they're speaking smoothly. The arms being open feels like the opposite of someone who's hiding something. 

Honestly, though, I'm not 100% sure. Body language alone isn't foolproof—some people just have natural gestures like that even when they're being truthful. And without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to tell. But based on what I see, it *seems* like they're being straightforward. The cues I'm seeing lean more toward calm, engaged truth-telling than deception, even if it's not a perfect match. I'd hesitate to call it a lie, but I wouldn't say "definitely true" either. It just feels... natural, like they're just sharing something they believe.

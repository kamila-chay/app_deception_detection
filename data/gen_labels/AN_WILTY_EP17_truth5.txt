Looking at the video, the person seems pretty steady—no obvious fidgeting, no weird facial expressions, and they're keeping pretty consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That steady gaze is the thing that sticks out the most to me. Usually, when people are lying, I'd expect them to look away a lot or seem distracted, but here they're just looking right at the camera like they're focused on the conversation. It feels like they're being straightforward, not trying to hide anything.  

But then I think, "Wait, could they just be really good at faking it?" I've heard that some people who lie actually practice making eye contact to seem honest, so maybe they're not nervous because they're rehearsed. And honestly, it's hard to tell if someone's lying just from one thing—like, maybe they're just naturally calm or used to being on camera. The way they're speaking seems smooth too, no awkward pauses, which could mean they're telling the truth, but it could also mean they're just not the type to stumble over words even when they're being dishonest.  

The other thing is, there's almost nothing else going on—no raised eyebrows, no lip biting, nothing. That lack of nervous energy feels... honest? Like, if they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* little tell, but there's just this quiet, calm presence. Still, I can't rule out that they're just a really composed liar. People do differ—some stay cool under pressure, others crack.  

Honestly, based on what I'm seeing, it leans toward them telling the truth. The steady eye contact and lack of fidgets seem more aligned with someone being genuine than someone trying to cover up. But I'm not 100% sure—there's always room for doubt, especially since body language isn't foolproof. If I had to guess, though, I'd say they're being truthful. It just feels... consistent.

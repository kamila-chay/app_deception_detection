Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because it's really hard to tell just from the video alone. The person is making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to and nodding along, which usually feels like signs of someone being engaged and truthful—like they're actually listening and trying to connect. They don't seem fidgety or avoidant, and there's no obvious tension in their face, like frowning or forced smiling. That part leans toward "truth" for me.  

But then there's the finger-crossing thing—right at the end, they cross their fingers while talking. I know some people do that unconsciously when they're nervous, but it's also a thing people associate with "crossing fingers for luck" or even "lying" in a superstitious way. I've heard that crossing fingers *can* sometimes be a subtle sign of deception, like they're trying to "make it true" in their head. So that part makes me pause—could they be lying and doing that without realizing it?  

Still, though, the other cues don't match typical "lying" behavior. No awkward pauses, no shifting eyes, no lip biting or excessive blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells. Maybe the finger-crossing is just a habit—like how some people tap their foot or play with their hair when they're thinking. I've seen people do that while being completely honest.  

Honestly, I think the eye contact and nodding are way stronger indicators than the finger thing. Without more context—like what they're actually saying—it's easy to overread a single gesture. I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like the finger-crossing might be a red herring, or maybe they just have a nervous habit. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those cases where the *absence* of lying cues might actually be the strongest clue.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit of a toss-up. The person seems pretty calm overall, which makes me lean toward them being truthful, but there are a few things that give me pause. They're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which usually feels like a sign of honesty, especially since they're not avoiding it completely. Their head is up and they're not fidgeting much—no hands rubbing, no crossed arms, no exaggerated movements. That's pretty consistent with someone being straightforward. 

But then there's the lip retraction and the chin moving upward a bit, which feels a little tense. Like, they're not smiling or frowning, but their lips are pulled back slightly, and the chin shift makes them look like they're holding something in. That *could* be nervousness about the topic, not necessarily lying—maybe they're just uncomfortable discussing it. The head side-turn also feels natural, like they're thinking, not like they're trying to hide something. And the gaze down? That's tricky. Some people say looking away means lying, but I've seen it happen when someone's genuinely trying to recall details or process what they're saying, especially if they're not used to being on camera. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more classic signs—like avoiding eye contact entirely, fidgeting, or those "tells" like excessive blinking. But they're not doing any of that. The fact that they're not making big gestures or seeming flustered makes me think the tension might just be about the subject matter, not deception. Like, maybe they're telling a story they're not proud of, so they're a little stiff, but not outright lying. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The behavior doesn't scream "liar," but it's not a perfect "truth" either. I'd probably go with truth because the lack of obvious deception cues outweighs the minor tension, but I wouldn't bet money on it. If I had to guess, I'd say they're telling the truth, but I'm not 100% confident—they seem like they're being honest, just maybe a bit uneasy about what they're saying.

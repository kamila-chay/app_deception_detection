Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone, honestly. What stands out to me is that the person's eyebrows are definitely furrowed in a frown, and their eyes keep glancing sideways—not directly at whoever they're talking to. At first glance, that *could* look like someone avoiding eye contact while being deceptive, which is a common thing people associate with lying. The sideways gaze especially makes me think, "Okay, are they nervous or hiding something?"

But then I start second-guessing myself because I remember reading that frowning and looking away aren't actually reliable signs of lying. A lot of people frown when they're concentrating hard on what they're saying, or when they're genuinely upset about something. Maybe they're just frustrated with the question, or processing a complicated thought, not trying to cover up a lie. And sideways glances? I've seen so many honest people do that when they're thinking—like they're mentally searching for the right words, not trying to fabricate them. It's not the classic "downward gaze" that people often link to deception, and it's not accompanied by other classic "lying" cues like excessive blinking, lip biting, or fidgeting, which the description says aren't there. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, you'd expect maybe more subtle signs—like a slight hesitation or a forced smile—but the video doesn't show that. The absence of those tells makes me lean toward them being genuine. But I'm not totally sure because sometimes liars are really good at controlling their expressions, so the lack of obvious signs might just mean they're skilled, not truthful. Honestly, though, the frown feels more like annoyance or deep thought than the kind of anxiety you'd see in someone actively deceiving. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect their whole demeanor to feel off or tense, but it just looks like they're focused on answering, maybe a little irritated by the line of questioning. 

So yeah, I'm kinda split, but leaning toward them telling the truth. The behavior matches what I'd expect from someone being honest but maybe a bit frustrated or thoughtful—not someone putting on an act. But I'd definitely want to see more context to be sure, because these little cues can be so ambiguous. It's easy to jump to conclusions about eye contact, but I think in this case, the lack of other "red flags" makes truth more likely. Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it—I'd say it's plausible they're being truthful, but I can't rule out the possibility they're just very good at hiding it.

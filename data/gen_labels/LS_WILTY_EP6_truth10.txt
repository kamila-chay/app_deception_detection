Hmm, this is tricky. From what I can see in the clip, the person seems pretty calm overall. They're making eye contact with whoever they're talking to most of the time, which usually makes me lean toward them being truthful—like, people who are lying sometimes avoid eye contact, but not always. They're nodding along while talking, which feels natural, like they're engaged in the conversation. And they're doing that head tilt thing a few times, which I've noticed people do when they're thinking or trying to be understanding, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

But then there's the sideways glance they keep making—like, they're not staring straight ahead, which could mean they're not fully present, maybe even a little distracted. And they're shrugging a couple of times, which sometimes happens when someone's not sure about what they're saying, like they're hedging. I mean, shrugging *could* just be their normal way of talking, but it does make me wonder if they're downplaying something.  

The thing that stands out most is how *not* nervous they seem. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or tight lips—those are the signs I usually associate with lying, and they're all absent here. If they were making up a story, I'd expect them to be a bit more tense. But they're just... relaxed. Like they're answering honestly without overthinking it.  

Still, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe they're really good at hiding it, or maybe the sideways gaze is just because they're thinking of the right words. Head shaking could be "no" to a question, not a sign of deception. Honestly, the more I watch, the more it feels like they're being straightforward. But I'd never bet my money on it—body language's messy, and people act differently. If I had to guess? I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the full context to be sure.

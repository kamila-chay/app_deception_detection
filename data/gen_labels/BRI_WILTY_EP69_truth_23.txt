Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though it's really hard to say for certain. They're looking up and sideways a lot, which might make someone think they're avoiding eye contact to hide something, but I've read that people often look up when they're trying to recall details or think things through, not necessarily when lying. Like, if you're trying to remember a fact, your eyes might drift up naturally. And the weird thing is, they're not doing *any* of the usual "nervous" stuff—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no tight lips or frowns. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* signs of stress, like scratching their neck or shifting in their seat, but they're just sitting there calm. That makes me think maybe they're not stressed because they're being honest. But then again, I know some people are really good at hiding it—they might be practiced liars who don't show any of those signs. Or maybe they're just not the type to get flustered. Honestly, the lack of tells feels more like truth to me, but I can't rule out that they're just very composed. It's a tough call either way.

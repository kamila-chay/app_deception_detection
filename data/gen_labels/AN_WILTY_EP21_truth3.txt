Watching the clip, I'd say the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They're making steady eye contact with whoever's talking to them—like they're really listening—and their arms are open, which usually feels like someone being genuine or not hiding anything. They're not fidgeting much either, and their head's tilted a bit like they're processing what's being said, not like they're dodging. But then there's that thing with their fingers crossed—like they're holding up a "thumbs up" with their fingers while they're talking. I've seen people do that when they're nervous or trying to seem sincere, but honestly, I've also known people who just cross their fingers habitually without even thinking about it. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that awkward pause where they're not saying anything. But here, they're not doing any of that. They're actually keeping their gaze steady, and their body's relaxed. The crossed fingers could just be a nervous tic, not necessarily a sign of deception. I mean, some people do that when they're trying to be careful with their words, but it's not a dead giveaway. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because the overall vibe feels open and present, but I can't rule out that finger thing. It's not a huge red flag, though—like, if they were lying, I'd expect more obvious tells. Maybe they're just a little anxious, but not lying. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those clips where the behavior just seems... neutral, not deceptive.

Hmm, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them not being completely truthful, though I'm really not certain. The way they're raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking frequently—especially when they're speaking—makes me think they're a bit stressed or trying to manage their expression. That kind of nervous energy can sometimes come up when someone's not being straightforward, like they're rehearsing or second-guessing what they're saying. And the fact that they keep glancing down instead of meeting the other person's eyes, even though they're nodding along, feels a bit off. Like, if they were just telling a normal story, they might look more engaged, but this seems like they're avoiding direct contact, which I've noticed can happen when people are being careful with their words.

But honestly, I'm hesitating because all these cues could also just mean they're really nervous about the situation—maybe they're not used to being on camera, or they're genuinely worried about what they're saying. I've seen people blink a lot when they're just tired or in a bright room, and head tilting is often just a natural way to listen or think, not necessarily a sign of lying. They're nodding a lot, which usually feels like agreement, but sometimes people do that automatically without even realizing it. And the way they're looking at the other person sometimes—like when they glance up briefly—makes me wonder if they're trying to seem honest while still fidgeting internally. It's really hard to tell without knowing the context, though. Like, maybe they're just a very expressive person who gets flustered easily, and that's why they're doing all these things. I wouldn't bet on it being a lie, but I also can't rule it out completely. It feels like a maybe, but I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd feel confident either way.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying here—this one's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is that they kept looking right at the person talking to them the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, like they're trying to be open. But then there's that moment where their eyebrows went up pretty sharply, almost like they were surprised by the question. I've seen that before—sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're trying to think of a story or when they're stressed, not just when they're being truthful. It could just be a natural reaction to the question though, like they genuinely didn't expect it.  

On the flip side, there's nothing else that screams "lying" to me: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses or lip movements. If they were making something up, I'd expect them to seem a bit more nervous—maybe blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. But they just sat there calmly, which makes me wonder if they're actually telling the truth, or if they're just really good at hiding it. Sometimes people who lie well don't have those obvious tells, especially if they're practiced.  

I guess the thing that nags at me is that eyebrow thing. If they were being honest, why would they look so startled? But then again, maybe the question *was* unexpected, and they're just reacting naturally. Like, if someone asks you a random question out of nowhere, you might raise your eyebrows too. I'd lean toward them being truthful just because there's no other weird behavior, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. Honestly, I'm split—I'd say maybe 60/40 truth, but I'd definitely want more context before I'd feel confident.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and open in their body language, which makes me lean toward them telling the truth, but I can't be 100% sure. They're keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like, they're not darting their eyes away or avoiding looking at the person directly—and their arms are wide open with palms facing up, which feels like a natural, non-defensive posture. That kind of openness usually comes across as genuine, not like someone trying to hide something.  

But here's where I hesitate a little: they're also looking down quite a bit while still making eye contact. Normally, when people lie, they might look away more, so this downcast gaze is a bit confusing. Maybe they're just naturally thoughtful or a bit shy, not nervous. I've seen people who are really honest still glance down while speaking—like they're concentrating on what they're saying, not trying to hide it.  

On the flip side, though, I know some people can be really good at faking calmness. Maybe they're practiced at hiding tells, or maybe they're just really comfortable with the situation. The fact that they don't seem to fidget, squirm, or make any obvious nervous gestures (like touching their face or blinking a lot) does help tip the scale toward truth, but it's not foolproof. Some liars are very controlled.  

Honestly, the open arms and palms up are the strongest clues for me—they're hard to fake if someone's trying to be deceptive. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension, like arms crossed or hands in their lap. But here, everything feels relaxed and engaged. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure, because body language alone isn't always the whole story. For now, based on what I'm seeing, it feels like they're being truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just seems... natural, not rehearsed.

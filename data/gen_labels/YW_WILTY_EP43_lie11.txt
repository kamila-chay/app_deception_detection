Looking at the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where the cues feel kind of mixed up. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. Their palms are up, which I've heard people say can signal openness, and they've got a slight smile—lip corners up—like they're trying to seem friendly or relaxed. That *feels* like they're being genuine, especially since they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact like I'd expect if they were hiding something.  

But then there's the exaggerated eye opening and raised eyebrows... that's weirdly intense for a normal conversation. Like, they're squinting their eyes wide open and raising their brows *way* more than seems natural. I've read that when people lie, they sometimes overcompensate with these "too-perfect" expressions to seem convincing, so that part makes me pause. And the smile—it's there, but it doesn't look warm or genuine, just... fixed. Like they're forcing it.  

I keep going back and forth though. Maybe they're just really excited or animated about what they're saying? Some people naturally have big expressions, and the raised eyebrows could just be surprise at a question. The palms up thing might not even mean anything—maybe they're just gesturing naturally. And honestly, I don't think the absence of classic "lie" signs (like blinking a lot or looking away) is a solid indicator of truthfulness either. Some liars are super calm and make perfect eye contact.  

So yeah... I'm torn. The smile and eye contact lean toward truth, but the over-the-top expressions feel like they might be trying too hard. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're not lying, but I'd be really hesitant to swear on it. It's not clear-cut, and I'd want to see more of the context—like what they're actually saying—to feel confident. It’s the kind of clip where you’d probably ask a friend, "Wait, did that seem off to you too?" and they’d say, "Hmm, not sure, but yeah, the eyes were kinda weird."

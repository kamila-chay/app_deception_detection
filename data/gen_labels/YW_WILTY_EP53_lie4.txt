Watching the clip, I'm noticing this person seems pretty steady in their delivery. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze toward interlocutor is on, which usually feels like someone trying to be genuine. They're also nodding along as they speak, which often just means they're engaged or emphasizing a point, not necessarily lying. What stands out to me is how their eyebrows are raised a bit—like they're genuinely surprised or processing something—rather than forced or fake. I don't see any of those classic "tells" people associate with lying: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. They're just... calm.  

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes raised eyebrows *can* be a sign of deception, like when someone's trying to look innocent or "surprised" to cover up a lie. And maybe the nodding is overdone? Like, if they're trying too hard to seem agreeable. I've heard that some people who lie will actually *increase* eye contact to seem trustworthy, so maybe that's what's happening here. But then again, the way they're moving—no hands rubbing, no lip biting, no shifting around—feels too relaxed for someone who's stressed about lying. Most of the time, when people are deceptive, they're fidgeting or avoiding the gaze, not holding it steady.  

Honestly, the absence of those other cues makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little nervous energy—like the blinking or fidgeting that's listed as "False" here. But since none of that's happening, it feels more like they're just being straightforward. Still, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're a really good liar who's practiced not showing any signs. Or maybe the raised eyebrows are just their natural expression when they're thinking. It’s tricky.  

All things considered, I’d guess they’re telling the truth—just because the behavior seems so *unstressed*. But I’d want to see more context before I’d feel confident about it. Like, what are they even talking about? If they're saying something super obvious, the calmness makes sense. If it’s something sensitive, then maybe the lack of reaction *is* suspicious. But based on what I see here, my gut says truth.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always cut-and-dried. What stands out to me is that they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—like, their gaze is locked on the interlocutor, which feels like engagement rather than avoidance. And even when they glance down, it doesn't seem like they're shying away; it almost looks like they're thinking or being earnest, not hiding something. Plus, their whole posture is open: arms relaxed and spread out, palms facing up like they're being transparent. I've seen a lot of videos where liars cross their arms or keep hands closed, so the opposite here feels noteworthy.  

That said, I can't rule out the possibility they're just really good at faking it. Some people can stay calm under pressure and mimic open body language even when lying—maybe they've practiced this. The downcast gaze could also be misinterpreted; in some contexts, people look down when they're stressed or recalling something, which *could* happen if they're making something up. And honestly, I'm not sure if the "gaze towards interlocutor" being true fully overrides the down look. Like, maybe they're being honest but still a bit uneasy?  

But overall, the lack of nervous ticks really stands out to me. No fidgeting, no lip-biting, no awkward pauses—they're moving smoothly, and the open gestures just feel... genuine. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd be cautious. I mean, I've seen so many examples where people *look* honest but aren't, so I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Still, the absence of classic "lie" cues combined with the open posture makes it hard to believe they're actively deceiving someone here. It feels more like someone who's just being calm and straightforward, even if they're a little nervous. I'd say truth, but I'm not 100% sure—there's always room for that one detail I might be missing.

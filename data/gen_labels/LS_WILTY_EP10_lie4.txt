Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from watching, but I'll walk through what I'm noticing. At first, the smile stood out to me—lip corners up, consistent with the description—and that's a bit of a red flag because people often smile when they're trying to seem friendly or calm while lying, especially if they're nervous. Then there's the frequent blinking; I've heard that's a common stress sign, like when someone's trying to recall something or feeling pressured. And they're glancing sideways a lot while talking, which I've read can sometimes happen when people are constructing a story, though I'm not 100% sure that's a solid indicator. 

But here's where it gets tricky: they're actually holding eye contact pretty well with the person they're talking to, which feels counterintuitive. I always thought liars avoided eye contact, but some people do the opposite—overcompensate with too much. And that head shaking? It's subtle, like a quick "no" motion, but it could just be a nervous habit or how they process thoughts, not necessarily deception. The sideways head tilt too—it might just be them being engaged, not deceptive. 

On the flip side, maybe the smile is genuine? Some people just smile a lot when they're comfortable, and the blinking could be from the lighting or just being tired. The sideways glance might just be how they naturally look while thinking, not lying. I keep circling back to the eye contact—since they're not avoiding it, that makes me question the "deception" label a bit. Like, if they were lying, wouldn't they be looking away more? But then again, I've heard that's not a rule. 

Honestly, I'd lean toward "maybe lying" because of the smile and blinking combo, but I'm really not certain. It could easily be all in my head—maybe they're just a naturally expressive person. I'd need more context or to see the full conversation to feel confident. At the end of the day, it's ambiguous, and I wouldn't bet on it one way or the other without more to go on.

This situation is somewhat difficult to interpret based solely on the video, but certain behaviors suggest to me that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their eyes are opened much wider than usual, as if they are trying unusually hard to appear attentive or surprised, which can come off as somewhat unnatural. Additionally, their gaze frequently shifts downward—not towards the person they’re speaking with, but towards their own lap or the floor. This pattern often aligns with discomfort or an attempt to conceal something. 

While this is not the typical avoidance of eye contact often linked with deception, the combination of exaggerated eye opening coupled with looking away feels like an effort to appear sincere that isn’t quite genuine. That said, there are alternative explanations: they might simply be nervous, shy, or deep in thought, especially if the context involves pressure or stress. Some individuals naturally express intensity by widening their eyes or glance down when trying to recall information, so it’s not definitive proof of lying.

The absence of more obvious nervous gestures—like fidgeting or outright eye contact avoidance—complicates the interpretation. They do look at their conversational partner at times, which could indicate they’re not completely deceptive, or perhaps only subtly so. Still, this unusual mix of nonverbal cues does incline me to suspect they might be stretching the truth or withholding some information.

I wouldn’t say with certainty that they’re lying, but I do lean toward the possibility of deception given these specific behaviors. More context, such as the nature of the conversation or additional body language cues, would be needed to be more confident in that assessment.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but I'm leaning toward them possibly not being truthful just based on the way they're looking down so much. It's weird how they keep their gaze directed downward the whole time—like, they're avoiding eye contact with whoever they're talking to. I know people often say that avoiding eye contact is a classic sign of lying, so that's the first thing that jumps out at me. But then again, I've heard that it's not always reliable. Some people naturally look down when they're thinking, or maybe they're just shy, or even feeling embarrassed about the topic—not necessarily lying. Like, if they were telling the truth but felt awkward about it, they might still do that.  

Also, the rest of their behavior doesn't scream "deception" at all. They're not fidgeting, not touching their face, not blinking a lot, not smiling nervously or anything. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little stress cues—like the hands moving around or the eyes darting. But here, they're just... still, with that downward gaze. It almost feels like they're concentrating hard, which could mean they're trying to remember a story or make up something, but it could also just mean they're being polite or thoughtful.  

I guess the thing that's throwing me off is that it's so subtle. If they'd been laughing or frowning or something, it'd be clearer, but this is just one thing. And honestly, I don't know if I'd even notice it if I wasn't looking for it. Like, maybe they just have a habit of looking down when they talk, and it's got nothing to do with lying. I mean, I'd want to see more context—like, what are they even saying?—to feel confident. But based on what I see, the gaze down is the only thing that stands out, and it's not enough to really say for sure. I'd say it's a maybe, but I'm not going to bet on it.

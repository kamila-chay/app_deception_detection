Honestly, I’m leaning toward the possibility that they might not be telling the truth, mainly because they keep looking down so much. It feels like they’re avoiding eye contact, which is often considered a classic sign of deception. While I know that avoidance of eye contact isn't always reliable—some people look down when they’re thinking, shy, or embarrassed—this persistent downward gaze seems a bit too deliberate.  

The rest of their behavior doesn’t strongly point to lying—they’re not fidgeting, touching their face, blinking excessively, or showing nervous smiles. Usually, if someone’s lying, you might expect those kinds of stress signals. Here, though, they seem quite still, almost as if they’re concentrating hard, which could be trying to recall a story or perhaps fabricating one.  

The subtlety of this signal is what makes me hesitant to be certain. If there were more obvious cues like laughing nervously or frowning, it would be clearer. And maybe looking down is just a habitual or polite gesture. Still, with no other signs contradicting this, I tend to lean toward the idea that there’s something off—enough to suspect they might be deceptive, though I wouldn’t say that with full confidence.

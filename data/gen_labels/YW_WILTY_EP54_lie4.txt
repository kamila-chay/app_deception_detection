Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just based on the video. So, the person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's a big one, because a lot of people assume liars avoid eye contact, but actually, truth-tellers often do that too, especially if they're engaged. And they're nodding along, which feels like active listening, not something you'd typically see from someone who's trying to hide something. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect maybe more fidgeting, or looking away more, but they're not doing any of that—no blinking too fast, no hand movements, nothing like that.  

But here's where I get stuck: the absence of nervous tells doesn't *prove* they're truthful. Some people are just naturally calm under pressure, or they might be rehearsed, or maybe they're lying about something they don't even care about, so they're not stressed. I've heard that really good liars don't show physical signs at all, and sometimes truth-tellers get nervous about other things, so it's not a perfect clue. Like, maybe they're just really good at keeping their cool, or maybe the question isn't even that important to them.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the fact that they're being so visibly engaged (eye contact, nodding) could actually be part of the deception—like they're overcompensating to seem honest. But honestly, I don't see any of the classic "liar" signals here, so it feels more like they're being genuine. I'd lean toward truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context—like, what are they even talking about? If it's a minor thing, they might not be stressed, but if it's something big, maybe they're just really composed. Either way, I don't see the signs that would make me think "definitely lying," so I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. It's one of those cases where the behavior doesn't scream deception, so my gut says truth, but I'd hesitate to bet on it.

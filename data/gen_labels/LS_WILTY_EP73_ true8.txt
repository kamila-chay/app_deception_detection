Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, but I'll try to walk through what I'm seeing. The person seems to be looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which feels like a good sign—liars often avoid eye contact, so that makes me lean toward them being honest. They also have this head tilt and a slight side-turn, which usually looks natural when someone's engaged or trying to process something, not like a nervous tic. And they're not doing any of those obvious "lying signs" like frowning, smiling too much, or covering their mouth. That part seems consistent with truth-telling.

But then there's the downward gaze—they're looking down while they talk, which sometimes happens when people are thinking hard or trying to recall details, but it could also be a sign of discomfort. I've seen people do that when they're not sure how to answer, so it's a little ambiguous. And the raised eyebrows... that's interesting. It could just be them reacting to a question with genuine surprise or curiosity, but sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're trying to seem sincere, like they're overcompensating. I'm not sure if that's the case here though.

On the other hand, there's no awkward silence, no lip movements that seem forced, and their body language isn't closed off—no crossed arms or shrinking back. Those are all things that usually point to honesty. But yeah, it's not a slam dunk. It's possible they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're nervous about the question but not lying. I'd say it feels more like truth than deception based on the overall calmness and lack of red flags, but I can't rule out that the downward gaze might be a tiny hint of hesitation. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without more context—like what they're actually saying—but based on the behavior alone, it seems like they're probably being truthful. I'd lean toward "truth" but with a little uncertainty, since body language alone isn't always foolproof.

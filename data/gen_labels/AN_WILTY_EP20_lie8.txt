I'm not 100% sure, but here's how I'm reading it as I watch. The person seems to be looking directly at the camera the whole time, which feels a bit unusual for someone who's nervous or hiding something—most people who lie tend to avoid eye contact, right? But they're shaking their head a lot while they're talking, which I'd usually associate with disagreement or denial, so that *does* make me wonder if they're being evasive. Then there's the palms-up gesture—they're holding their hands open like they're trying to show they're being honest, which is the opposite of what I'd expect if they were lying. 

But here's where it gets tricky: head shaking can be a nervous habit, or just how they naturally express themselves when they're talking, not necessarily tied to deception. And palms up isn't a foolproof "truth" signal either—some people do it constantly, even when they're being honest. I've seen videos where people do that while being completely truthful, and others who use it while lying. The fact that they're not fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or showing any other classic signs (like lip biting or excessive blinking) actually makes me lean toward them being genuine. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more physical tension, but they seem pretty relaxed otherwise. 

Still, I'm not ruling out deception entirely because head shaking *can* sometimes indicate they're pushing back against a question they don't want to answer. But honestly, the palms-up thing is throwing me off—it feels like they're trying to *project* openness, which might be a red herring. Maybe they're just naturally expressive. I'd say it's close to even, but the lack of other "lie" cues makes me think it's more likely they're telling the truth. Though I'd want to see more context—like what they're being asked—to be sure. Hard to say for certain just from this clip.

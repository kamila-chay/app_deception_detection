While the person maintains direct eye contact, which is somewhat unusual for someone concealing something, their frequent head shaking during speech raises some doubts, as it often signals disagreement or denial and could indicate evasion. The palms-up gesture, typically associated with honesty, complicates the pictureâ€”it's possible they are trying to consciously project openness, which could be a form of deception rather than a genuine signal. Although this gesture alone isn't definitive, combined with the persistent head shaking, it suggests they might be putting effort into appearing truthful. Their lack of other classic telltale signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact might be because they are experienced at controlling their behavior or simply comfortable in front of the camera. Given these mixed signals, I lean towards the possibility that they could be deceptive, but it remains uncertain without more context.

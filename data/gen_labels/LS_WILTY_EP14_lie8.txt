Watching the clip, I'd say it's really hard to call for sure. The person seems pretty animated at first glance—like they're really trying to engage, with their head tilted and eyes locked on the person asking the question. But then I notice they're scratching their head and touching their face a lot, which feels a bit off. That kind of fidgeting often happens when someone's stressed or trying to cover something up. Their eyebrows are raised too, which could be surprise or maybe even a bit of defensiveness. 

On the flip side, they're not avoiding eye contact—they're actually looking right at the other person, which sometimes makes me think they're being honest. Liars often glance away or look down, but here they're keeping that gaze steady. The head tilting also feels like they're genuinely listening or processing, not like they're rehearsing a lie. And honestly, they don't seem to be forcing any smiles or fake expressions, which is a bit unusual if they were lying—most people trying to deceive might overdo the "friendly" cues. 

But then again, maybe they're just naturally nervous about the question, not lying. Some people scratch their head when they're just thinking hard or feeling awkward, not because they're hiding something. The sideways glance they make could just be them gathering their thoughts, not avoiding the truth. And that chin moving up? It's subtle, but it might just be a little gesture of hesitation, like "Hmm, let me think." 

I guess I'm leaning a bit toward them telling the truth because of the steady eye contact and lack of obvious "tell" signs like forced smiles or avoiding the gaze. But I wouldn't bet on it—those head-touching and scratching moments really stick out. If I had to guess without seeing the context, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd be really unsure. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need more to go on, like what the question was or how they acted before. Honestly, it’s tough—could go either way.

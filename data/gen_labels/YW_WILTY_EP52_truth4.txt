Honestly, watching this clip, I'm kind of stuck between two thoughts. On one hand, the person seems really calm—they're making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like a good sign for truthfulness. There's no fidgeting, no avoiding the gaze, no weird facial expressions like scowling or exaggerated blinking. The only thing I notice is a single shrug at the end, which seems pretty natural, like they're just emphasizing a point casually. It doesn't look forced or nervous, which is what I'd expect if someone was lying.  

But then I keep thinking, "Wait, maybe they're just really good at hiding it?" I know some people can lie without any obvious tells—they're practiced, or maybe they're just not the type to get flustered. That shrug could even be a little too relaxed, like they're trying *too* hard to seem unbothered. I've seen people do that before, especially if they're rehearsed. And honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context—like, what were they even talking about? If it's something they're really confident about, the calmness might just be genuine.  

Still, the lack of *any* stress signals stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a tiny bit of hesitation or a nervous tic, but there's nothing. The video just feels... smooth. Like they're just answering a straightforward question. I guess I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's tricky—sometimes truth looks like calm, but sometimes calm is just a cover. Honestly, without more to go on, I'd say it's probably true, but I can't rule out the possibility they're just a really chill liar. It's one of those cases where the absence of lies feels like a clue, but not a guarantee.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always clear-cut. What stands out to me is that they're smiling quite naturally—lip corners up, no fake or forced look—and they're nodding along while speaking. That usually feels like agreement or engagement, which often lines up with being honest. Their eyes are mostly on the person they're talking to, and they're shifting their gaze down and sideways in a way that seems like they're thinking or recalling something, not avoiding eye contact like some might do when lying. 

But then there's the head movement—they're tilting it back a bit (head moving backward) and turning their head side-to-side, which can sometimes signal hesitation or discomfort. And they keep touching their head or face a little, which might be a nervous habit. I wonder if that's just them being expressive though, or if it's a sign of stress. Sometimes people do that when they're telling the truth but just feel a bit self-conscious. The chin moving upward also feels like they're leaning in, which seems confident, but I've seen liars mimic that too to seem sincere. 

The thing that makes me lean toward them being truthful is the lack of red flags. No frowning, no exaggerated eye movements, no awkward pauses where the mouth's closed—they're relaxed in a way that feels genuine. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting more intensely. Here, the smile and nods feel consistent with what they're saying, and the head movements seem like natural conversation gestures, not nervous tells. 

Still, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the head turning is just them gesturing while thinking, and the hand touch is harmless. But based on what I see, it seems more likely they're being honest. It doesn't *feel* like deception—more like someone who's calm and engaged, even if they're a little restless. I'd say truth, but I'd hesitate to swear on it without more context.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, though I can see why it might seem suspicious at first. The most noticeable thing is how they're looking at the person they're talking to—gaze directly toward them most of the time, which usually feels like genuine engagement. They're also nodding along, which often matches what someone's saying when they're being sincere. That head side-turn they do while speaking? It's a bit odd, but I've seen people do that when they're just thinking or emphasizing a point, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're trying to picture something they're describing.

But here's where it gets tricky: the raised eyebrows and the sideways glance could be red flags for some people. I've heard that sideways eye movement sometimes correlates with fabrication, and raised eyebrows can signal stress or surprise—like they're bracing for a question. If they were lying, those might make sense as nervous habits. However, the video doesn't show any of the classic "lie tells" we usually hear about: no frowning, no lip biting, no awkward pauses, no excessive blinking. The lack of those makes me doubt the lying angle more. People who are lying often have more of those micro-expressions, but here it's mostly calm, steady eye contact with just a few subtle shifts.

I guess the biggest thing is that the behavior feels *consistent*—they're not contradicting themselves with their body language. If they were making something up, I'd expect more tension, like their hands fidgeting or their jaw tightening. Instead, they're relaxed in posture, nodding, and keeping that direct gaze. It's not perfect, but it aligns more with someone who's honestly recounting something. Still, I can't rule out that the sideways look might just be their normal way of thinking, not a sign of deception. Honestly, without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to be sure, but based on the cues alone, I'd say truth feels more likely. I'd want to hear the actual words to be 100% though—sometimes the words change everything.

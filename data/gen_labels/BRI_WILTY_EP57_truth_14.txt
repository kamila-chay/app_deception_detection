Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest. Honestly, it's tricky because people get nervous in videos, and that can look like lying even when they're not. They're nodding a lot while looking down at the floor, which feels like they're really listening or thinking hard—sometimes truth-tellers do that when they're recalling details. Their head tilts a bit too, like they're engaged, and their chin moves up slightly when they speak, which is a bit odd but not something I'd automatically link to lying. They also cover their mouth with their hand once, but it's not dramatic—just a quick touch, like they're trying to hold back a laugh or just adjusting their posture.  

That said, I can see why someone might think they're hiding something. The mouth-covering and the chin movement stand out a little. If I were guessing, I'd lean toward truth because they're making consistent eye contact with the camera (gaze toward interlocutor is there), nodding naturally, and not avoiding the question. But I'm not sure—nervousness can mimic deception. Maybe they're just shy or overthinking the video setup. I've seen people cover their mouths when they're stressed about speaking, not necessarily lying. The head tilting and downcast gaze feel more like concentration than guilt.  

Still, it's hard to rule out deception entirely. If they *were* lying, the nervous gestures might make sense, but the overall calmness of the interaction—no frantic blinking, no fake smiles—makes it feel less like a lie. I think I'd go with truth, but I'd hesitate a lot. Like, maybe they're just a naturally fidgety person who happens to be telling the truth. It’s not 100% clear, but the behaviors don’t scream "liar" to me.

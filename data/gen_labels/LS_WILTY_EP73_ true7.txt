Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure—it's a bit of a toss-up. They're nodding along while looking directly at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like engagement and agreement. There's no frowning, no weird pauses where their mouth's closed awkwardly, and they're not fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact entirely. The sideways glance might make me pause for a second—sometimes people look off to the side when they're thinking, which could mean they're crafting a story, but it could also just be how they naturally speak. And that eyebrow raise? It's a bit odd, but it doesn't feel like a lie—it might just be surprise or emphasis, like "Wait, really?" instead of a sign of deception. I've seen people raise eyebrows when they're being honest too, especially if they're reacting to a question. The lack of nervous ticks (no lip biting, no rapid blinking) really tips it for me though. Still, I can't rule out that sideways look entirely—maybe they're rehearsed, or maybe they're just a bit distracted. But overall, it feels like they're being genuine. I'd say truth, but honestly, it's not a slam dunk. It's the little things that keep me second-guessing a bit.

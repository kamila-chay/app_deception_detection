Looking at the video, I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive, though I’m not completely certain. While they seem composed at first—maintaining steady eye contact and showing no obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding gaze that might clearly indicate lying—there are subtle cues that raise some doubts. The moment where their eyebrows shoot up, as if genuinely surprised by the question, combined with their slight head pullback, strikes me as somewhat off. That movement feels like an attempt to create physical distance, which can be a sign of stress or discomfort often associated with trying to hide something.

On the other hand, it’s true that expressive gestures like raised eyebrows can simply reflect genuine surprise, and shifting posture might just be a natural response while processing a question. The lack of classic lie indicators such as awkward pauses or forced smiles does make me hesitate, as I might expect more obvious signs if they were outright fabricating. Still, those subtle signals—especially the unusual head movement—make me suspect there may be more beneath the surface.

Without additional context or hearing the full conversation, it’s difficult to be sure. However, given the mixed cues, I lean toward the possibility that the person is not being completely truthful, though I would want more information to confirm this suspicion.

Looking at the video, I’m honestly a bit torn. The person seems pretty composed at first glance—no obvious signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, which I’d expect if they were lying. They’re making steady eye contact with whoever’s talking to them, which actually feels a bit unusual for someone who’s hiding something, since I’ve noticed people often look away when they’re not being truthful. But then there’s that moment where their eyebrows shoot up—like they’re genuinely surprised by the question—and their head pulls back slightly, almost like they’re recoiling a bit. That little head movement feels off, like they’re creating physical space, which sometimes happens when people are stressed or trying to distance themselves from what they’re saying.

On the flip side, I keep thinking maybe they’re just naturally expressive. Raising eyebrows isn’t always a lie—it could just be genuine surprise at the question, like they weren’t expecting it. And the head moving back? Maybe they’re just adjusting their posture while thinking, not because they’re nervous about lying. I’ve seen people do that all the time when they’re trying to recall something, even if they’re being honest. Plus, there’s zero signs of classic "lie tells" here—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles. If they were lying, I’d expect more of those tells, especially in a situation where they’re being questioned directly.

Honestly, the absence of those other cues makes me lean toward them telling the truth, but that eyebrow raise and head shift are nagging at me. It’s possible they’re just a little uncomfortable with the topic, not necessarily deceptive. I’d need more context—like what they’re being asked about—to feel confident. But based on just the video, I’d say it’s probably truth, though I’m not 100% sure. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want to hear the actual conversation to be certain.

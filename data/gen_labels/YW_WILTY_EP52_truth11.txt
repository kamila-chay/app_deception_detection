Watching the clip, I'd say it's really hard to be 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it *feels* like they're being truthful. They're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's a big one, since people often avoid eye contact when lying. And their eyebrows are raised, which in my experience usually happens when someone's genuinely surprised or trying to emphasize something they believe is true, not when they're crafting a lie. Plus, their arms are open, not crossed or tense, which seems like an open, non-defensive posture. I've seen a lot of people with crossed arms or fidgeting when they're nervous about lying, but here it's all relaxed.

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. Raising eyebrows *can* sometimes be a nervous tic, like when someone's trying too hard to seem innocent. And arms open isn't a perfect sign—some people just naturally gesture that way, even when they're lying. I've heard of people using "open arms" as a deliberate tactic to seem trustworthy while still being deceptive. Also, there's no smile or laughter, which some might expect from a genuine storyteller, but I don't think that rules out truthfulness—people can be serious while telling the truth.

Honestly, the combination of direct gaze, no fidgeting, and open posture feels more consistent with honesty to me than deception. But I'm not going to claim I know for sure—without hearing the actual words or knowing the context, it's all just reading body language. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd still be a little cautious. Like, maybe they're just naturally calm, or maybe they're really good at hiding it. It's not a slam dunk, but it's not suspicious either.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the video alone. What stands out to me is how often they're blinking—like, way more than usual. I've heard people say that's a sign of stress or maybe trying to think of a story, which could hint at deception. Then there's the raised eyebrows—they seem genuinely surprised or maybe even skeptical at times, but I'm not sure if that's part of the conversation or just how they react. 

But here's where I get stuck: they're also nodding a lot while they talk, which usually feels like agreement or understanding, and their eyes are mostly on the person they're talking to—well, mostly, but they glance sideways a few times too. That sideways gaze is confusing because some people do that when they're thinking, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're just trying to remember something. And they're not doing any of the classic "lying" stuff I've heard about—no frowning, no lip biting, no avoiding eye contact completely. The head turning sideways while nodding feels a bit off, though. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more consistently, but they're still making some eye contact and nodding. 

On the flip side, maybe they're just nervous in general—like, maybe they're in an interview or being recorded, and that's why they're blinking so much. The raised eyebrows could just be their natural expression when they're listening hard. I've seen people who are super expressive with their eyebrows even when they're being totally honest. And the sideways looks? Could be habit, or maybe they're glancing at notes they're referencing. 

Honestly, I wouldn't feel confident saying "yes, they're lying" based on this. It feels like it could go either way—stress from the situation versus deception. The blinking and the eyebrow thing make me lean slightly toward it being a bit off, but the nodding and partial eye contact keep me from being sure. If I had to guess, I'd say it's possible they're not being fully truthful, but I'd need more context—like what they're actually saying—to feel any stronger about it. It's not clear-cut, and I'd want to hear the conversation to be honest.

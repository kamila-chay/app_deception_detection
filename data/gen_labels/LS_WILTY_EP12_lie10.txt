Watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that the person might not be entirely truthful. The frequent blinking stands out—it’s noticeably more than usual, and since excessive blinking can indicate stress or an attempt to fabricate a story, this raises some suspicion. The raised eyebrows appear to show surprise or skepticism, which could be genuine, but it might also be part of a subtle attempt to mask dishonesty. 

Their nodding and mostly consistent eye contact suggest some level of engagement or agreement, which complicates the picture. However, the occasional sideways glance seems a bit unusual; while some people do glance sideways when thinking, in this context it might indicate discomfort or evasiveness. It's also noteworthy that they don’t exhibit some classic signs of lying like frowning or lip biting, but the head turning combined with nodding feels somewhat off—if they were completely truthful, their behaviors might be more straightforward. 

That said, it’s possible the nervousness of being recorded or interviewed is influencing their mannerisms, leading to the increased blinking and expressive eyebrows. Still, balancing these cues, I find myself more inclined to suspect some level of deception than complete honesty. I wouldn’t say it’s certain—they could just be stressed or cautious—but the combination of these signs makes me lean toward thinking they might be holding something back. More context or insight into their words would help clarify things, but for now, the evidence points slightly more toward them not being fully open.

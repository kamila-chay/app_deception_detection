Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while speaking. They're holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no looking away or shifting their gaze around, which often happens when someone's trying to avoid suspicion. Their hands are open with palms up, which usually reads as non-threatening or honest in body language, and they don't seem to be fidgeting or touching their face like some people do when they're nervous. There's no sign of a forced smile or any exaggerated expressions either—just a calm, neutral face.  

That said, I'm not totally sure. I know some people can fake being calm when they're lying, especially if they've practiced or are really good at controlling their reactions. Like, maybe they're used to being in high-pressure situations where staying still is part of the job, so their lack of movement doesn't necessarily mean they're telling the truth. And honestly, it's hard to tell without knowing the context—like, if this is a job interview or a casual chat, the baseline for "normal" behavior might be different.  

But the thing that sticks out to me is how relaxed they seem overall. No rapid blinking, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to find words, and no signs of tension in their posture. When people lie, they often have little tells—like avoiding eye contact or crossing their arms—but here, everything feels... open. Like they're not hiding anything. I mean, it's not 100% proof, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're being truthful than not. It's not that I'm certain, but the absence of classic "lying cues" makes it lean that way for me. Still, I'd want to hear the full conversation before I'd say for sure.

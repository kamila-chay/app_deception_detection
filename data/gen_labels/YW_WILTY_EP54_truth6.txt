Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because you can't always tell just from a few cues. What stands out to me is how calm they seem—they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? And their palms are up, open, which I've heard people say often happens when someone's being genuine, not hiding something. Plus, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to speak—they're just... steady. The chin moving up a little when they say something feels like a subtle nod of agreement or affirmation, which also leans toward truth.  

But then there's the raised eyebrows. That's the part that makes me pause. Sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're being sarcastic or trying to seem surprised, even if they're lying. Like, maybe they're overcompensating to seem innocent? I mean, I've seen people do that in interviews before—like, "Oh, *really*?" with a raised brow, but then they're lying. And it's possible they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're rehearsed, so the calmness isn't accidental.  

Also, the lack of any nervous habits—no lip biting, no excessive blinking, no hands covering their face—usually points to truth, but I know some liars are really good at controlling that. Like, they practice not fidgeting. So maybe it's all staged. But the direct gaze and palms up still feel more consistent with truth to me. I guess it's the combination that matters: the openness of the palms, the steady eye contact, and the lack of *any* signs of stress. The raised eyebrows could just be a natural reaction to what they're saying, not a lie signal.  

Honestly? I'm leaning toward truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It feels like the cues are mostly aligning with honesty, but I can't rule out that the eyebrows are a red herring. If I had to guess without knowing anything else, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but it's not a slam dunk. It's the kind of thing where if I saw it in real life, I'd probably think, "Hmm, they seem sincere," but I'd still wonder if they're just really good at hiding it.

Hmm, okay, so I'm watching this video clip where the person is answering some question, and honestly, the first thing that stands out is how steady their gaze is. They're looking directly at whoever's asking, like, the whole time—no shifting eyes up, down, or sideways. That's the only thing really noticeable in the whole clip, right? Like, they're not fidgeting with their hands, not blinking a lot, not making any weird facial expressions—no scowling, no raised eyebrows, not even a little smile or frown. They just keep that calm, direct eye contact the whole time.

Now, from what I've seen before, when people are being honest, they often maintain more natural eye contact without avoiding it. Like, if someone's lying, they might look away to think or seem nervous, but here they're holding it. That *feels* like it leans toward truth, you know? It's not like they're acting overly eager or anything—just calm, steady, and focused on the person they're talking to. The lack of all those other little "tells" (like fidgeting or awkward pauses) also kind of supports that. It seems like they're not trying to hide anything, just answering.

But... I can't be totally sure, right? Because I've heard that some really practiced liars *also* learn to hold eye contact to seem truthful, so it could just be them being good at faking it. And honestly, eye contact norms vary a lot—maybe they're from a culture where looking away is rude, so they're just being polite, not necessarily truthful. Or maybe they're just really focused on the question and not nervous at all, regardless of whether they're lying. Like, if they're telling the truth and it's a simple question, they wouldn't need to look away. So the steady gaze might not mean much on its own—it's just... what they're doing.

Still, when you combine the steady eye contact with *absolutely nothing else*—no signs of stress or deception—the whole thing feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. It's not flashy or forced, just quiet and consistent. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* of those other tiny signs to pop up, even if they're trying to hide it. Like, maybe a quick blink or a slight shift in posture. But here, it's just... still. So yeah, it makes me lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd definitely want to see more context or hear the actual words before I'd be 100% sure. It's just a vibe from the video, not a guarantee.

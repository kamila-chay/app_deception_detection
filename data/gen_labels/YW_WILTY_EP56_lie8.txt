Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's a bit of a toss-up. The person is looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—no avoiding eye contact, which is interesting because I usually associate that with someone trying to be convincing, but it could also just mean they're engaged. Their eyebrows are raised a lot, though, like they're genuinely surprised or processing something. That's the thing that sticks out to me most. I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're being honest and trying to remember something, but I've also seen it when someone's trying to seem innocent. 

On the flip side, there's absolutely no sign of classic "lying" tells—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles, no looking away. They're just sitting there, calm, with their head up and eyes locked on the other person. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* nervous energy, right? But this feels... steady. Maybe they're just really good at staying composed, or maybe they're actually telling the truth and that eyebrow thing is just them being thoughtful. 

I guess the counterargument is that sometimes people who lie *do* look you straight in the eye to seem believable, so the direct gaze might be a red herring. But then again, the lack of other cues makes me lean toward "truth" more than "deception." Still, I'm not confident—I've been wrong before when something seemed too calm to be a lie. It's really hard to say without knowing the context of what they're saying. My gut says they might be telling the truth, but I'd need more to be sure.

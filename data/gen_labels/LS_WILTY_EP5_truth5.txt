Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because the cues are kind of subtle. From what I'm seeing in the video, the person has this really tight, downturned mouth—like they're frowning or even pouting a little, and their lips are pushed out slightly. They're also looking straight down at the ground the whole time, not making eye contact with whoever's talking to them. At first glance, that downward gaze and the tense mouth feel like they might be uncomfortable, which sometimes makes people think someone's hiding something. Like, when people lie, they often avoid eye contact or look away to avoid being caught, right? And the frown could read as guilt or stress.

But then I keep thinking about the other stuff they're *not* doing. There's no fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no awkward pauses where they're just... stuck with their mouth shut. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension—like hands rubbing, shifting in their seat, or maybe even forced smiles to seem relaxed. But here, they seem pretty still, just quietly staring down. That actually feels more like someone who's genuinely processing something, maybe feeling embarrassed or just deep in thought, not necessarily trying to cover up a lie. Truth-tellers often look away when they're recalling details accurately, especially if it's a sensitive topic, and they don't always act "perfectly" calm. 

The thing that's really making me lean toward truth is how *natural* the frown seems. It's not this exaggerated, fake "I'm nervous" look—just a quiet, tired expression. If they were lying, I'd expect the face to feel more forced, like they're trying too hard to seem innocent. But here, it's just... there, like they're genuinely upset or frustrated about whatever they're saying. Maybe they're just not the type to look people in the eye when they're talking, or maybe they're uncomfortable with the question. Either way, the lack of classic "lying" tells (like the hand movements or over-the-top expressions) makes me think it's more likely they're being honest. But I won't say for sure—I mean, people can be really good at hiding things, and that gaze down *could* still be a sign of deception. It's just... not screaming "liar" to me like some videos do. I'd probably say they're probably telling the truth, but it's not 100% clear.

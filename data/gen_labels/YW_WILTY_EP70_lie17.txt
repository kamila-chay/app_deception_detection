Based on what I’m seeing in the video, I’m leaning more toward the person probably being deceptive, though I can’t be entirely certain. What catches my attention is the way their eye contact fluctuates—they make eye contact with the person they’re talking to, but then noticeably glance down quite often. This pattern of alternating between engaging eye contact and a downcast gaze feels somewhat unnatural, as if they’re trying to appear engaged but then breaking away in a manner that could suggest they’re constructing a story. From what I’ve observed before, this kind of gaze shift can often indicate someone is not fully honest.

That said, I’m aware that some people naturally look down when they’re thinking or concentrating, especially during conversations, and this might just be a sign of shyness or trying to carefully process their words. The rest of their behavior also seems fairly calm—they’re not fidgeting, showing nervous smiles, or touching their face, which are more typical signs of deception. This calm demeanor complicates the picture and makes me wonder if they might actually be truthful, with the downward gaze simply being their normal way of expressing thought.

It’s also possible they have learned to control their body language well, which can obscure typical deception cues, especially if they’re accustomed to high-pressure situations. Still, the inconsistent eye contact combined with the somewhat forced gaze shifts gives me reason to suspect they may not be telling the whole truth. So, while it’s not definitive, I lean toward thinking they could be deceptive. I’d want to review the video again, considering the timing of their gaze with what they’re saying, and get more context before being more certain.

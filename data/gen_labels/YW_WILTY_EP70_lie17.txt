Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive, but I'm really not 100% sure—it's tricky. The main thing that stands out to me is how they're looking. They keep making eye contact with the person they're talking to (that "gaze towards interlocutor" thing), but then they also seem to glance down quite a bit, like they're avoiding direct eye contact in a way that feels a little forced. It's not like they're staring at the ceiling or anything, but that mix of looking at the other person while frequently dropping their eyes down—it kind of feels like they're trying to seem engaged but then slipping into that downcast look when they're thinking, which I've noticed before can happen when people are crafting a story.  

But here's why I'm hesitant: a lot of people naturally look down when they're concentrating or thinking, especially in conversations. Maybe they're just shy, or maybe they're genuinely trying to process what they're saying without realizing it. And honestly, the rest of their behavior seems pretty calm—they're not fidgeting, not smiling awkwardly, not touching their face, which is the opposite of what I'd expect if they were really nervous about lying. If they were lying, I'd half-expect to see more of those little tells, like hands moving or exaggerated gestures, but they're just sitting there relatively still. That makes me wonder if maybe they're actually telling the truth, and the downward gaze is just their normal way of speaking.  

I guess it's also possible they're just really good at controlling their body language, which happens sometimes. People who've practiced lying or are used to high-pressure situations can suppress those physical cues. So while the gaze pattern feels a bit off to me, it's not a slam dunk. I'd say it's a maybe—leaning toward deception because of the inconsistent eye contact, but I'd want to hear what they're actually saying first before I'd feel confident. Without more context, it's really hard to tell if that downcast look is a sign of lying or just someone who thinks with their eyes down. I'd probably need to watch it again to see if the timing matches up with what they're saying.

Looking at the clip, the person is sitting with their arms crossed, staring upward with their gaze fixed in that direction, and not showing any other obvious facial expressions or gestures—no smiles, frowns, blinking, or shifting around. At first glance, crossed arms often make people think "defensive" or "lying," but honestly, I've seen that posture a lot when people are just thinking deeply or feeling a bit cold, not necessarily hiding something. The fact that they're not fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or showing any nervous ticks like lip biting or excessive blinking makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were making it up, I'd expect more signs of stress—like darting eyes, shaky hands, or that awkward pause where they seem to be searching for words. But here, they're just sitting quietly, looking up, which feels more like they're genuinely trying to remember or process something, not constructing a story. 

That said, I can see why someone might think they're lying. Crossed arms *are* a classic "lie detector" trope in movies, and some people interpret looking upward as a sign of fabrication (like "they're making it up"). But I've also read that when people recall real memories, they often look up or away—they're actually accessing their brain's storage, not lying. Plus, the absence of any other stress cues really stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little more physical tension, even if it's subtle. It just feels... calm, not forced. 

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure—people are complicated, and context matters (like what they're even talking about). But based on what I'm seeing here, the lack of nervous behavior tips it for me. I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just doesn't *feel* like a lie when you watch it.

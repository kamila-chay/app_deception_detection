Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. At first glance, they seem pretty engaged—they're making eye contact with the person they're talking to, and their arms are open, which usually feels like someone trying to seem approachable or honest. But then there are these little things that stick out to me. Like, they keep covering their mouth with their hands a few times, which I've heard can be a sign of trying to hold back what they're saying—like they're second-guessing themselves. And their eyes are blinking a lot, almost like they're stressed or uncomfortable, which sometimes happens when people are lying, but it could just be nervousness from being on camera too.  

Then there's the chin thing—they're moving it up and down constantly, almost like a tiny, restless tic, and they're also shaking their head a lot while talking. I know some people shake their heads when they're disagreeing or thinking, but in this context, it feels a bit off. Their gaze flicks sideways a few times too, which I've read can signal someone recalling a story instead of remembering something real. But wait—some people just naturally look away when they're thinking, right? Like, not all sideways glances mean deception. And they're nodding a lot, which usually feels like agreement, but maybe that's just them trying to seem cooperative.  

I keep circling back to the mouth-covering. That one feels strong to me—like when someone unconsciously covers their mouth, it’s often because they’re suppressing a lie. But I also think about the counter: maybe they’re just tired, or they have a habit of doing that when they’re concentrating. The open arms and direct eye contact make me wonder if they’re actually being sincere, and the frequent eyebrow raises could just be them reacting to what’s being said, not necessarily lying. Honestly, it’s hard to tell because stress and lying can look similar, and I don’t know the context. Like, maybe they’re just anxious about the whole situation, not deliberately deceptive.  

So yeah, I’m leaning a bit toward deception because of the mouth covering and the nervous energy, but I’m not sure. It could easily be them being genuinely stressed. I’d hesitate to call it a clear lie without more to go on—like, what are they even talking about? But based on what I see, I’d guess they might not be fully truthful, though I’d be cautious about saying that for sure. It’s one of those cases where you just can’t tell for certain from a video alone.

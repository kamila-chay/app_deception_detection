Watching the clip, I'd say it's really hard to tell for sure just from body language alone—people can be nervous for all sorts of reasons, and some of these cues are super subtle. But here's how I'm leaning: the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They're looking right at whoever they're talking to, which usually means they're trying to connect or be believable, not avoid eye contact like some people do when they're hiding something. Their hands are open with palms up, which feels like an honest, non-defensive gesture—like they're not hiding anything. And they're not fidgeting or doing those little nervous things, like touching their face or blinking a lot. The head tilt feels natural, like they're listening, not trying to think of a lie.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. Some people are just really good at staying calm when they're lying—maybe they've practiced or they're used to being under pressure. And the head side-turn? I've seen people do that when they're just thinking, not necessarily being deceptive. Also, palms up can sometimes be a conscious "I'm being truthful" move, but it could just be how they naturally gesture. If they were lying, I might expect more tension—like a tight jaw or shifting eyes—but there's none of that here.  

Honestly, the lack of "red flag" behaviors (no frowning, no awkward pauses, no hiding hands) makes it seem way more likely they're being truthful. But I'd still want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure. Like, maybe they're just really good at not showing stress, but the video itself doesn't give me any reason to doubt them. So yeah, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd say "probably" not "definitely." It's just... the behavior feels too relaxed for someone trying to pull one over.

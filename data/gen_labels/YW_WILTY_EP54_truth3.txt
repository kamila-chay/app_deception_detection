Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure—there are a few things that make me hesitate. First off, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty. When people lie, they often avoid looking directly at you, so that's a point in their favor. They also don't seem fidgety at all—no nervous blinking, no hands moving around, no awkward pauses where they're trying to think of words. That calmness makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying, which often happens when you're being truthful.  

But then there's this exaggerated mouth opening they do—like their mouth opens really wide when they're speaking. At first, I wondered if that's a sign of lying, like they're trying too hard to seem sincere. I've heard that liars sometimes overdo expressions to seem genuine, so that made me pause. But honestly, it could also just be natural enthusiasm or surprise—like they're really emphasizing a point, not trying to hide something. And since they're not doing anything else that seems off (no scowling, no head shaking, no hands covering their face), the mouth thing might just be part of their normal way of speaking.  

I guess the counterargument is that maybe they're a really good liar who's practiced not showing nervous habits, so the lack of fidgeting doesn't mean much. But that feels less likely to me—most people aren't that skilled at hiding all signs of lying, especially in a casual moment like this. The head moving backward a little bit? I'm not sure what that means, but it doesn't seem like a classic "lying" gesture, so I'm not counting it against them.  

All in all, the eye contact and lack of nervous behavior are pretty strong for truthfulness, even if that exaggerated mouth thing threw me for a second. I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but it's not a slam dunk—there's always room for doubt, especially since people can act differently when they're nervous or excited. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to see more context to be sure.

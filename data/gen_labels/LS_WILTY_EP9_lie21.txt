Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn on this one. The person seems pretty engaged—they're maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, since people who lie often avoid direct gaze. They're also nodding along like they're actively listening or agreeing, which feels natural in conversation, not like someone trying to cover up something. And they don't seem fidgety at all—no nervous blinking, no hands rubbing or touching their face, which are things I've noticed people do when they're stressed or hiding something.  

But then there's that chin movement—upwards, like they're lifting it slightly. I've read that sometimes when people are being deceptive, they might do subtle things like that, almost like they're trying to "hold their head up" to seem more confident while lying. It's not a super obvious tell, though, and it could just be their natural way of moving their head while talking. They're also tilting their head and turning it sideways a bit, but that seems like a normal gesture when someone's listening thoughtfully, not something I'd immediately flag as suspicious.  

The thing that makes me hesitate is that *absence* of other signs. If they were lying, I'd expect to see more of the classic "tells"—like avoiding eye contact, shifting around, or fidgeting. Since they're not doing any of that, it feels more like they're being genuine. But I know some people are really good at lying without showing those signs, so I can't rule it out entirely. Maybe the chin thing is a red herring, or maybe it's a small clue I'm overthinking.  

Honestly? I'd lean toward them telling the truth just based on how relaxed they seem overall—no tension in their posture, steady eye contact, and no signs of the usual nervous energy. But I'm not 100% sure because deception can be tricky, and that chin movement is nagging at me a little. If I had to guess without seeing the label, I'd say truth, but I'd still be open to the possibility that I'm missing something subtle. It's hard to say for sure without more context, though.

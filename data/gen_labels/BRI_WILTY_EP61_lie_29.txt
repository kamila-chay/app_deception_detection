Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those situations where the cues feel a bit ambiguous. They're raising their eyebrows a few times, which stands out because it's the only noticeable gesture in the clip. Normally, when people are being deceptive, they might show more signs like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that "deer in headlights" look, but here they're not looking at the person they're talking to (which is a bit odd, since most people would at least glance their way), and they're not doing anything else nervous—no blinking, no lip biting, no shifting in their seat. 

On one hand, the eyebrow raises *could* be a sign of stress or internal conflict, like they're trying to remember something or feel uneasy about the question. That's a common micro-expression when people are lying, especially if they're trying to seem calm. But on the other hand, eyebrow raises can just be a natural reaction to surprise or confusion—maybe they genuinely didn't expect the question, or they're processing it. I've seen people do that when they're telling the truth too, especially if they're caught off-guard. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact *entirely* (wait, no—they're not looking at the person at all, which is weird) but also not showing any other classic signs makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, because if they were lying, I'd expect more tension. Like, why would they just... freeze like that without any other tells? 

But then again, maybe they're really good at hiding it, or this is a habitual thing for them—some people just raise their eyebrows a lot when they're thinking. I'm also second-guessing the eye contact thing: in some cultures or for some people, not looking directly is normal, not suspicious. So it's hard to say if that's deception or just their baseline behavior. Honestly, the whole thing feels like a coin toss. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth because there's so little to go on, but I wouldn't bet money on it. Deception is possible, but the lack of other cues makes it feel... off. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to be *more* nervous, not just quietly raising eyebrows and not meeting the gaze. But yeah, I'm really not confident—I'd need more context or more video to be sure.

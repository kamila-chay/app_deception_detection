Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out based on what I'm seeing in the video. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to (the "gaze towards interlocutor" is clear), and their arms are open, which usually feels relaxed and non-defensive. There's no fidgeting, no weird facial expressions like scowling or forced smiling, and they're not avoiding eye contact by looking down or sideways *too* much—wait, actually, they *do* glance sideways a bit, but it doesn't seem nervous. It’s like they’re just looking at something off-camera while they speak, not hiding anything.  

The thing that stands out most is how *still* they are. No rapid blinking, no hands touching their face, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck. When people lie, they often get physically restless—scratching, fidgeting, or overcompensating with gestures. Here, it’s the opposite: they’re quiet, composed, and their body language feels open. The sideways glance could be a red flag for some, but honestly, I’ve seen people do that naturally when thinking or referencing something, and it’s not paired with other signs of deception.  

That said, I’m not 100% sure. Maybe they’re just really good at hiding it? Some people are so practiced that they don’t show classic tells. Or maybe the sideways look *is* a sign they’re not being fully honest, but it’s so subtle and isolated that it doesn’t add up with the rest of the calm behavior. Honestly, the absence of *any* nervous cues feels stronger than that one sideways glance. If they were lying, I’d expect at least *some* tension—like lips tightening or a micro-expression—but there’s nothing.  

So yeah, based on what I’m seeing, it leans toward them being truthful. But I’d still hesitate to say "definitely" because you can’t *prove* truthfulness just from body language. It’s just that everything they’re doing feels like what I’d expect from someone who’s calm and honest, not someone trying to cover something up. The open arms and steady gaze really sell it for me.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd say it's really hard to call for sure whether they're lying or not. The person is smiling and looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which feels like it could be genuine—like they're engaged and comfortable. They're also tilting their head a bit while speaking, which often reads as curiosity or active listening, not something you'd usually see in someone who's trying to cover up a lie. And they don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding eye contact in a way that screams "nervous liar"—no crossed arms, no hands covering their face, nothing like that.  

But then there's the frequent blinking. I've heard people say that people blink more when they're lying, but honestly, I'm not sure if that's reliable. They could just be tired, or maybe the lighting in the room is bothering their eyes, or they're just naturally a fast-blinker. I've seen so many videos where someone blinks a lot while telling the truth, like when they're stressed about something unrelated. And the fact that they glance sideways a couple times—well, that could just mean they're thinking or recalling something, not necessarily hiding the truth. Sometimes people look away when they're trying to remember details, even when they're being honest.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the smile and head tilting might actually be a little *too* deliberate—like they're trying to seem friendly to disarm the situation. But then again, if they're just naturally warm and expressive, that could explain it too. I don't see any of the classic "lie signs" like frowning, lip biting, or exaggerated gestures, which makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure.  

Honestly, without knowing the context—like what they're talking about or how high-stakes the situation is—it's really a toss-up. The blinking is the only thing that makes me pause, but I keep thinking, "Maybe they just have a speck of dust in their eye." So yeah, I'd probably say they seem like they're telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to swear on it. It's one of those cases where the behavior is more ambiguous than I'd like.

Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like a good sign for honesty. I don't see any obvious signs of stress or evasion like avoiding the gaze, fidgeting, or that stiff "fake smile" people sometimes use when lying. Their palms are up, which usually reads as open and non-threatening, and they're raising their eyebrows a bit, which could just be natural emphasis or surprise—not something I'd immediately link to deception. 

But here's where I hesitate: I know people can fake calmness really well, especially if they're practiced at lying. Maybe they're just really good at controlling their reactions, or maybe the eyebrow raise is actually nervousness disguised as engagement. I've seen people who lie still maintain eye contact and keep their hands relaxed, so that alone doesn't *prove* truthfulness. Also, the absence of "frowning" or "scowling" could just mean they're not upset, not that they're being honest—it's neutral behavior. 

On the flip side, the lack of other classic "tells" like frequent blinking, lip biting, or looking away makes me lean toward truth. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* subtle sign of tension—like a slight hesitation, a forced laugh, or hands hiding something. But here, they're just... present. They're not overdoing it, which feels genuine. It's hard to say for sure without context, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth. Still, I can't rule out that they're just really skilled at hiding it. It’s not a slam dunk, but it feels more like someone being straightforward than someone putting on a performance.

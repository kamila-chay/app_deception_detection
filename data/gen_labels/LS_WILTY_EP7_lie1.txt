Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% certain, but there are a few things that make me lean toward them possibly not being entirely truthful. They're nodding along and keeping their gaze directed at the person they're talking to, which often feels like engagement, but their eyes are doing a lot—looking up, then sideways, and back again. Frequent blinking stands out too, and while that can happen when someone's just tired or in a bright room, it sometimes comes up in stressful situations like when someone's trying to fabricate a story. The head tilting while they're speaking also feels a bit like they're trying to seem attentive, but the way their eyes dart around makes me wonder if they're rehearsing or checking their own story.

That said, I'm really not sure. The lack of other classic "deception cues" is making me second-guess it. They're not frowning, avoiding eye contact completely, or fidgeting with their hands—those are the things I usually associate with lying. The nodding and the head tilt could just be natural, friendly listening gestures, especially since they're maintaining eye contact most of the time. Maybe they're just a bit nervous about the conversation, not necessarily lying. I've seen people who are genuinely stressed or anxious blink a lot without being deceptive, and the sideways glances might just be them processing what they're saying, not hiding something. 

Honestly, it's tough to say for sure. Body language is super subjective, and without knowing the context or what they're actually saying, I don't want to jump to conclusions. The blinking and gaze shifts *could* hint at something, but they could also just be a nervous habit. I'd need more to go on—like what they're actually describing or how they're reacting to follow-up questions—to feel confident either way. Right now, I'm just leaning slightly toward "maybe" because of the eye behavior, but I wouldn't bet on it. It feels more like they're just being a bit uneasy than actively deceiving.

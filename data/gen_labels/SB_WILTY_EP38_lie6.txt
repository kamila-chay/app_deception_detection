Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. The person has this kind of tight smile going on, and their eyebrows are raised pretty high—like they're trying to look surprised or maybe a little too engaged. I also noticed they keep moving their chin up and down a bit, almost like they're nodding to themselves, and their gaze keeps flicking sideways instead of staying on the other person. That sideways look sometimes makes me think someone's avoiding eye contact because they're uncomfortable, which could be a sign of deception. Plus, the way they're smiling feels a little forced, not like a natural, relaxed grin.

But honestly, I'm second-guessing it too. The smile could just be them being polite or trying to seem friendly, and raised eyebrows often just mean someone's paying close attention, not necessarily lying. Their chin movements might just be a nervous habit they have, and the sideways gaze? That happens to a lot of people when they're thinking or just feeling a bit self-conscious, not always when they're hiding something. Also, their arms are wide open, which usually feels like someone's trying to seem open and honest, not deceptive. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or closed-off body language, but they seem pretty relaxed otherwise. 

So yeah, it's tricky. The cues I see *could* point to deception, but they also fit perfectly with someone who's just nervous or maybe genuinely trying to be agreeable. Without knowing the context or what they're actually saying, I just can't tell for sure. I'd lean toward maybe not lying, but I'm definitely not confident—I'd need more to go on.

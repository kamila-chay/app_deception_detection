From what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% sure if they're lying or not—it’s really tricky to tell just from body language alone. On one hand, they have a genuine-looking smile, which often shows up when people are being truthful, especially if it’s consistent with what they’re saying. But here’s where it gets messy: the smile seems a bit subtle, and the description says "Lip corners up" is false, which is confusing because a smile usually involves that. Maybe it’s just a very small smile, or maybe it’s not even a full smile at all. If they were lying, they might force a smile to seem friendly, but I’ve seen people smile naturally while telling the truth too, so that doesn’t *prove* anything.

What stands out more are the head movements—like the chin going up and down, and the head moving forward and backward while they talk. That feels like someone who’s really engaged or trying to emphasize points, which could happen when they’re being honest. But I’ve also noticed that nervous people sometimes do that when they’re making things up, so it’s not a solid sign either. The fact that they’re looking down a lot instead of at the camera could lean toward deception (since some studies link gaze aversion to lying), but honestly, I’ve seen people look down when they’re just thinking deeply or feeling shy, not necessarily lying. If they were trying to hide something, I’d expect more fidgeting or awkward pauses, but the video shows none of that—no blinking, no lip biting, no crossed arms. That actually makes me lean toward truth a bit more, because lying often comes with more nervous physical cues. 

On the flip side, maybe they’re just a very calm person who doesn’t show typical "lie signs," or maybe they’re rehearsed and pretending to be relaxed. The head side-turning feels natural, like they’re just nodding along with their own thoughts, not like they’re dodging questions. I keep circling back to the smile—it’s the one thing that feels most consistent with truthfulness, even if it’s not textbook. But I’m still not confident because body language can be so context-dependent. If this were a real conversation, I’d probably ask follow-up questions to see if their story holds up, not just guess from the video alone. For now, I’d say it’s *more likely* they’re telling the truth, but I’d hesitate to call it a sure thing. It’s just the absence of red flags that tips me slightly that way, not any hard evidence.

Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm really trying to figure this out. The person seems pretty calm and engaged—they're looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to connect, not avoid eye contact. Their hands are open, palms up, and arms are relaxed and spread out, which usually reads as honest or open to me. I've seen that kind of posture before when people are trying to seem trustworthy, but I know some liars do that too, so it's not foolproof. They also have their hands touching their head or face a couple of times, which might just be a nervous habit or them thinking, not necessarily lying. 

What's throwing me off a bit is those raised eyebrows—they look genuinely surprised or maybe confused by the question, not like they're faking something. If they were lying, I'd expect them to seem more guarded, maybe looking away or fidgeting more, but they're not doing that. The lack of obvious signs like frowning, avoiding eye contact, or over-the-top gestures makes me lean toward them being truthful. But... I'm not 100% sure. Sometimes people lie really smoothly, especially if they're practiced, and their calmness could just be them being good at hiding it. Like, maybe they're rehearsed or just naturally composed. 

Honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. The open body language and direct gaze really suggest honesty, but I can't ignore that raised eyebrow—it might be a red flag for me, even if it's not a strong one. If I had to guess without any other context, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd feel uneasy about it. It's not like they're sweating or stuttering, which would make deception more obvious, but it's not like they're acting suspiciously either. I think I'd need more of the conversation to be sure, but based on just this clip, I'm leaning toward truth. Still, I'd want to double-check if there's more to the situation.

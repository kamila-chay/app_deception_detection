Watching this clip, the person's expression immediately stands out—there's a clear scowl, frowning eyebrows, and their lip corners are pulled down, which feels heavy with tension. They're also moving their chin up and down a bit, and their head is turned sideways instead of looking at the person they're talking to. On the surface, those signs—like the frown and avoiding eye contact—do make me think they might be uncomfortable or possibly not being fully truthful. I've seen people do that when they're hiding something, like when they're trying to think of a story or feel defensive.  

But then I pause and wonder: what if they're just genuinely upset about what they're being asked? Like, if someone asked them a really personal or upsetting question, they might scowl and look away even if they're telling the truth. The way their chin moves—up and down—also feels like they're processing something heavy, not necessarily lying. And honestly, they're not doing any of the classic "lying" tells like faking a smile, covering their mouth, or blinking a lot, which makes me lean away from it being a clear deception.  

Still, it's tricky. The sideways head turn and lack of eye contact are red flags I'd usually consider, but they're not definitive. Maybe they're just shy or distracted, not deceptive. I'm not 100% sure—it could easily be that they're upset about the topic, not lying about it. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it *feels* more like they're being truthful but stressed than actively lying, but I wouldn't bet on it. There's just too much room for interpretation with their mood.

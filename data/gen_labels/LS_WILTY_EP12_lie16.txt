Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I've been watching this clip a few times to see if anything stands out. At first glance, the person seems a bit... fidgety? Like, they're raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking way more than usual—almost like they're trying to seem engaged or maybe a bit stressed. Their eyes are wide open, which feels a little forced, like they're overdoing the "I'm listening" thing. And their lips are pulled up at the corners, which could be a nervous smile or just a polite expression, but it’s not a full smile, so it’s hard to tell.

But then, the thing that makes me hesitate is how they’re looking directly at the person they’re talking to the whole time. I’ve heard a lot about liars avoiding eye contact, so that feels like it might actually lean toward them being truthful. They’re also shaking their head a few times, but that seems like a reaction to what’s being said—like "no, that’s not right"—not necessarily lying about it. And their chin moving up and down while their head’s bobbing forward and back? That’s weird, but it might just be a habit or nervous energy, not a classic "lie" sign.

On the flip side, the frequent blinking and exaggerated eyes *do* make me think they might be uncomfortable. Maybe they’re rehearsing what they’re saying, or they’re just really anxious about the situation. But I’ve seen people blink a lot when they’re genuinely trying to remember something, not when they’re lying. And the lip corners up—could be a tiny smile of relief, or just them not wanting to look too serious. 

Honestly, I’m split. The eye contact is strong evidence against deception, but the other cues are making me second-guess. If I had to guess, I’d lean toward them telling the truth, but I’d definitely want to see more context—like what they’re actually saying. It’s easy to misread these little things, especially when you’re not hearing the words. Maybe they’re just a very expressive person who gets nervous easily, and the blinking is just them being extra careful. I wouldn’t bet money on it either way, though. It’s one of those clips where it’s hard to tell without knowing the whole story.

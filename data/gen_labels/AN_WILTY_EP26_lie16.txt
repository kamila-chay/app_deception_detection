While I can't be completely certain, the signs here seem to lean more toward the person possibly not telling the truth. The way they keep shaking their head "no" while looking down at their hands feels somewhat inconsistent with their words, almost as if they're trying to persuade themselves or others. Their tightly furrowed brows and limited eye contact often accompany stress or concealment. Additionally, the repeated palms-up gesture might suggest nervousness rather than genuine openness, as it sometimes serves as a subconscious effort to appear innocent.

That said, there’s room for doubt. These expressions could just as well stem from frustration or sadness in response to upsetting news, and some people habitually shake their heads when wrestling with difficult thoughts—not necessarily when lying. The palms-up gestures might simply be natural movements while talking. Without knowing the context or the person’s usual behavior, it’s tricky to be sure. Still, given these cues collectively, I tend to lean toward thinking they may be deceptive, though it’s far from definitive. More information would be needed to feel confident in that judgment.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean slightly toward them not being truthful, though I'm really not 100% confident. The way they keep shaking their head "no" while looking down at their hands feels off—like they're trying to convince themselves or someone else, but it doesn't quite match the words they're saying. Their eyebrows are pulled down in a tight frown, and they're not making much eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which often happens when someone's stressed or hiding something. The palms-up gesture they keep doing also stands out; it can look like openness, but sometimes people do that when they're nervous, almost like they're trying to appear innocent.

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just really upset or frustrated about whatever's being discussed. That frown and downward gaze could easily be sadness or annoyance, not deception—like if they're hearing bad news they don't want to believe. And the head shaking? I've seen people do that habitually when they're thinking hard, not necessarily lying. The palms-up thing might just be them gesturing naturally while talking. Without knowing the context—like, *what* they're being asked about—it's really hard to say. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're genuinely confused by the question. I mean, I've seen people with similar cues who were totally honest, just stressed. So yeah, I'd say *maybe* lying, but it's super ambiguous. It's not like they're avoiding eye contact entirely or fidgeting like crazy, which would make me more sure. Honestly, I'd need more to go on.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person isn't showing any of the classic "tells" people usually associate with lying—no nervous fidgeting, no forced smiles, no avoiding eye contact by looking away excessively. They're just... sitting there with a calm, neutral expression, and their gaze is consistently down, not meeting the camera or whoever they're talking to. That downcast gaze is the most noticeable thing. 

At first glance, I might think, "Hmm, looking down could mean they're hiding something," because I've heard that liars often avoid eye contact. But then I remember that's actually a pretty common myth—truth-tellers do that too, especially if they're thinking carefully, feeling shy, or just naturally a bit introspective. In fact, the fact that they're not *dodging* eye contact (like glancing sideways or up) but just keeping their eyes down feels more like they're focused on what they're saying, not trying to evade. And they're speaking smoothly—no awkward pauses or stammering, which I'd expect if they were fabricating something. If they were lying, I'd probably see more tension in their face or hands, but they're completely still. 

That said, it's not impossible they're lying. Maybe they're just really uncomfortable with the question, and the down gaze is their way of dealing with that anxiety, which could coincidentally match a "lie" behavior. Or maybe they're a habitual looker-down, like they always do it when they're thinking. I can't rule that out. But the lack of *other* signs—no raised eyebrows, no lip-biting, no frantic blinking—makes me lean away from "lying." Most of the time, when people are being deceptive, they *do* show *some* physical shift, even if subtle. Here, everything's just... quiet. Calm. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of the conversation. If they're answering a personal question they're embarrassed about, looking down makes sense even if they're telling the truth. If it were a high-stakes lie, I'd expect more signs. So yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd guess they're being truthful—just not because they're "good at lying," but because they're not acting like they're hiding anything. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more certain.

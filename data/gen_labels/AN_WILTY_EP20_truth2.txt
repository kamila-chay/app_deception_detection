Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the only thing that stands out is that they keep looking sideways—not straight at the person they're talking to, but off to the side. Now, I know a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact, but I've also heard that's not always the case. Sometimes people look away when they're thinking or just feel awkward, not necessarily when they're lying. Like, maybe they're just not used to being on camera, or they're trying to remember details, or even just distracted by something in the room.

What makes me lean toward them being truthful is how calm they seem otherwise. They're not fidgeting with their hands, they're not blinking a lot, and they're not making any obvious nervous gestures—no touching their face, no crossed arms, nothing like that. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those little stress signs to show up, right? Like, even if they're trying to hide it, people often do something small without realizing it. But here, they're just... steady. Talking normally, with no exaggerated expressions or awkward pauses where their mouth is closed. It feels like they're just focused on what they're saying, not trying to hide anything.

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. That sideways glance *does* feel a bit off for a straightforward conversation. Maybe they're lying about something specific and that's why they're not making direct eye contact? Or maybe they're just naturally not a big eye-contact person. I've known people who always look away when they talk, and they're totally honest. It's hard to tell without knowing what they're saying or the context—like, are they being asked about something personal? If it's a casual question, the sideways look might mean nothing. If it's a high-pressure question, it might mean more. But from just the video, I don't have that info.

Honestly, I'd probably be leaning toward truth here because the rest of their behavior is so neutral and relaxed. The lack of other tells is pretty telling, even if that sideways gaze is a little confusing. But I'm not 100% sure—I'd want to hear the actual question and answer to feel better about it. Like, if they said something really specific and clear with no hesitation, I'd feel more confident. As it is, I'd say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those "I don't see any red flags, but I can't say for sure" situations.

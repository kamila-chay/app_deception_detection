Looking at this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where the behavior feels a bit ambiguous. On one hand, they're nodding a lot while they talk, and they seem to be looking directly at the person asking the question most of the time, which usually feels like someone trying to seem honest. They don't seem super fidgety either—no hands rubbing or covering their face, which I'd expect if they were really nervous about lying. But then there's this thing with their eyebrows—they keep raising them, like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, and they also glance sideways a few times instead of keeping steady eye contact. I've heard some people say that looking away or raising eyebrows can be signs of deception, like they're trying to think of a story or feel uncomfortable. 

But honestly, I'm second-guessing myself because it could just be them being naturally expressive. Maybe they're just really thinking about the question, or maybe they're not used to being interviewed and get a bit flustered. I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're genuinely confused, not when they're lying. And the sideways glances might just be how they think—some people look away when they're concentrating, not when they're hiding something. The nodding also feels pretty consistent, like they're genuinely agreeing with their own words, which doesn't scream "lie" to me. 

I guess I'm leaning a bit toward them being truthful because the eye contact is mostly there, and the behavior doesn't feel forced or overly rehearsed. But I'm not confident at all—there's just enough stuff that makes me wonder, like those raised eyebrows and the sideways looks, that I can't rule out deception. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably truth, but it's really close. Maybe it's just me being too skeptical, though—sometimes people act that way when they're just nervous, not lying. I'd need more context to feel sure.

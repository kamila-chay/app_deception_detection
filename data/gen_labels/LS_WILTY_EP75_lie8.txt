Looking at this clip, I’m starting to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. While they do maintain eye contact most of the time and nod when they speak, which can suggest honesty, some of their other behaviors raise questions. Their frequent eyebrow raises, which seem to express surprise or skepticism, combined with the occasional sideways glances, could indicate discomfort or an attempt to fabricate a story. These subtle cues often appear when someone is not being completely truthful.

Although it’s possible these actions stem from natural expressiveness or nervousness, those raised eyebrows and avoidance of steady eye contact make me suspicious. The nodding seems genuine, but it doesn’t entirely outweigh those other signs. The overall behavior doesn’t strike me as completely relaxed or natural, hinting that there might be something they’re not fully disclosing. So, while I can’t say for sure, I find myself leaning toward thinking they could be deceptive, even if it’s just a tentative impression. More context would certainly help clarify things.

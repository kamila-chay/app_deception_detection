Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I lean somewhat toward the idea that they might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. The way they’re looking sideways instead of directly at the person they're talking to, combined with their head being tilted slightly, could be a hint. Often, avoiding direct eye contact or shifting gaze like that can suggest someone is not being fully truthful, possibly because they're trying to come up with a story or avoid detection. While it's true that some people do this naturally when thinking or feeling shy, the sideways glance here feels a bit more deliberate.

Interestingly, they don’t show the usual nervous signs like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or crossed arms, which complicates things. This absence might mean they’re trying hard to appear composed—something that can happen when someone is concealing something and overcompensates to avoid suspicion. On the other hand, it could simply be their normal behavior, since some people habitually glance away when speaking, and that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re lying.

Without more context, especially about what they’re actually saying, I’m basically reading into a few subtle cues. The lack of overt stress signals might normally suggest truthfulness, but in this case, the gaze and posture make me suspect there's more beneath the surface. So, while it’s far from certain, I do tend to lean toward the possibility that they could be deceptive, even if the evidence isn’t strong enough to be definite.

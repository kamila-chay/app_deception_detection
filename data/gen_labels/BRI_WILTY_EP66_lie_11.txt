Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—there's just not enough clear signs to call it definitive. What stands out is how they're looking sideways instead of directly at the person they're talking to, and their head is tilted slightly to the side. I've heard that when people avoid direct eye contact or shift their gaze like that, it can sometimes signal they're not being fully truthful, like they're trying to think of a story or avoid being caught. But honestly, I've also seen people do that naturally when they're just thinking or feeling a bit shy, not necessarily because they're lying. They're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, not crossing their arms or anything—those are the classic "nervous" cues I'd expect if they were hiding something, but they're completely absent here. That makes me wonder if maybe they're just being quiet or thoughtful, not deceptive. 

On the flip side, though, if they *were* lying, it's possible they're actually trying too hard to seem calm and relaxed, which is a thing—some people get so focused on not giving themselves away that they overcompensate and avoid eye contact in a way that feels off. But then again, the sideways gaze could just be their normal way of talking; I've known people who always glance away when they're speaking, and it's nothing to do with truthfulness. Without more context—like what they're even saying—I feel like I'm just guessing based on a few small gestures. The lack of other stress signs makes me lean a bit toward "telling the truth," but I'm not confident at all. It's really one of those ambiguous moments where the behavior could go either way, and I'd probably need to hear the conversation to feel sure. I’d say it’s a maybe, but I’d hesitate to call it deception without more to go on.

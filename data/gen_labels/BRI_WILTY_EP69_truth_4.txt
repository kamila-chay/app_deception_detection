Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure this out, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person is nodding while they're talking—that feels like they're really engaged or emphasizing what they're saying, which usually lines up with someone being honest. They're also looking sideways a lot, not at the camera or the person they're talking to, and they're not doing anything like fidgeting, smiling awkwardly, or blinking a ton. I've heard people say avoiding eye contact means lying, but I know that's not always true—some people just naturally look sideways when they're thinking, or maybe they're just shy. 

On the other hand, if they *were* lying, you'd expect to see more signs of stress, like their voice cracking, or maybe they'd be overcompensating with big gestures or fake smiles. But here, they're calm, no lip biting, no crossed arms, nothing like that. They're just speaking normally while nodding and glancing sideways. It’s weird that they’re not making eye contact, but I’ve seen a lot of people do that without it meaning anything shady—like when they’re recalling something or just not used to being on camera. 

I guess the thing that makes me lean toward truth is the lack of *any* nervous tells. If they were lying, I’d expect at least a little something—maybe a slight pause, or their hands moving around. But they’re just sitting there, nodding, looking sideways, and talking straight through it. It feels… natural? Like they’re just a person explaining something without trying too hard. But I’m not 100% sure—could be they’re really good at hiding it, or maybe sideways gaze is a habit for them. Honestly, I’d say it’s probably truth, but I’d need to hear more to be confident. It’s hard to tell from just this clip alone.

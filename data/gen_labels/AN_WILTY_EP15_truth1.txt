Hmm, this is actually pretty tricky to call just from watching. The person seems pretty relaxed overall—like they're genuinely engaged in the conversation. They're smiling a lot, and it looks natural, not like a stiff or forced grin. Their eyes are mostly on the other person, which usually feels like someone trying to be sincere, and they're even tilting their head a bit, which often comes across as attentive or curious. The palms-up gesture they keep doing—like, hands open and facing up—feels like they're trying to seem open and honest, which is a common nonverbal cue people use when they want to be believed. I don't see any of the classic "lying" signs either, like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or looking down like they're nervous. No awkward pauses either, which makes it feel like they're just calmly sharing what's on their mind.

But you know, it's hard to be sure. Sometimes people smile and look relaxed even when they're lying—they might be really practiced at it, or maybe they're just naturally expressive. That sideways glance they have a few times could be a red herring too; I've seen people glance sideways while thinking or just because they're comfortable, not necessarily because they're hiding something. And honestly, the palms-up thing? I've heard it's not a foolproof sign—it could just be a habit, like how some people gesture when they talk. If they were lying, I'd expect to see more tension, like their smile tightening up or them touching their face, but I don't see that here. It just feels... effortless. Like they're not trying too hard to convince anyone.

Still, I can't rule out that they might be lying and just doing a good job of it. People lie all the time without breaking a sweat, especially if they're not stressed. But based on what I'm seeing—the consistent eye contact, the natural smile, the lack of nervous gestures—it leans more toward them being truthful. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but if I had to guess? I'd say they're probably telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of behavior that's trying to cover something up.

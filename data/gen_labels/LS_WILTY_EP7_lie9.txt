Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I'm leaning toward them being deceptive—not because it's obvious, but because a few things stood out that don't quite line up with how I'd expect someone to act if they were being completely honest. For instance, they kept raising their eyebrows really quickly, like they were trying to seem surprised or engaged, but it felt a bit forced. And they blinked way more than usual—like, constantly—while they were talking, which I've noticed before can happen when people are stressed or trying to think of what to say next. Their chin also kept jutting up slightly, like they were holding themselves stiffly, and they kept leaning back a bit while tilting their head sideways, which made me wonder if they were trying to create distance or avoid looking too directly at the person they were talking to. 

But here's where I'm hesitant: they were smiling a lot, and they kept looking right at the person they were speaking to, which is the opposite of what I'd expect from someone lying—they usually avoid eye contact. Sometimes people smile when they're nervous or trying to seem friendly, but it could also just be their natural way of interacting. The head tilting might not mean anything at all—it could just be how they listen when they're paying attention. And the frequent blinking? I've definitely blinked a lot when I'm just tired or focused on something, not necessarily when I'm lying. 

So yeah, I'm not 100% certain. It's possible they're just a very expressive person who gets nervous easily, or maybe they're genuinely happy to be talking to this person and the behaviors are all coincidental. But the combination of the rapid blinking, the stiff chin, and the odd head movements while still maintaining eye contact... it just feels a little off. Like they're trying too hard to seem normal, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. But I could totally be wrong—I've been fooled before by people who just have quirky habits. It's really hard to tell for sure without knowing the context, but based on what I saw, deception feels like the more likely explanation than a straight-up honest conversation.

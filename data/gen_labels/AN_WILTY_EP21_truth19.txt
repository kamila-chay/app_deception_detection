Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, though I can't say for certain. The person is looking directly at the camera the whole time—no glancing away or looking down like I'd expect if they were trying to avoid eye contact while lying. They're also nodding along naturally while speaking, which feels like genuine engagement rather than a forced "yes" to seem convincing. There's no fidgeting, no weird pauses where they seem to be searching for words, and they're not pulling any of those classic "telling a lie" tells like over-smiling or covering their mouth. 

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes people who lie really well practice this exact behavior—like they've been told to "just look at the camera and nod" to seem honest. I've seen that happen before, especially in scripted or rehearsed situations. And honestly, some people just naturally maintain eye contact without being deceptive, so that alone isn't proof. The lack of nervous gestures could also mean they're calm because they're not lying, but it could equally mean they're confident in their lie. I don't see any signs of stress—no rapid blinking, no lip biting, nothing—but stress doesn't always show up visibly, right? 

If I had to guess, the steady eye contact and natural nodding feel more like someone being comfortable with what they're saying. But I'm not going to claim I know for sure—lying can be subtle, and truth-telling can look nervous too. I'd say it's more likely truth because the behavior aligns with how people act when they're not hiding something, but I'd want to see more context before I'd bet on it. Like, what's the actual question they're answering? Without that, it's just reading body language in a vacuum. So yeah, I'm leaning truth, but I'd say "probably" not "definitely."

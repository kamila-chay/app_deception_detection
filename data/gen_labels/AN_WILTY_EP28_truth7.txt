Hmm, this is tricky to call just from watching, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person seems pretty steady in their gaze—they're mostly looking at whoever's talking to them, which usually feels more like someone being honest, not trying to cover something up. Like, when people are lying, they often avoid eye contact or look away more, but here they're actually meeting the gaze most of the time. That makes me lean toward truth, but I'm not sure.

Then there's the head side-turning and raised eyebrows. I've seen people do that when they're genuinely surprised or processing a question, not necessarily lying. Like, if someone asks them something unexpected, they might raise their eyebrows and turn their head slightly, which feels natural here. The downward gaze they have sometimes—yeah, that could be a red flag for some, like "they're avoiding looking at me," but honestly, I think a lot of people just look down when they're thinking or being careful with their words, whether they're lying or not. It's not like they're staring at the floor or anything.

I keep wondering if the lack of other tells matters too. No fake smiles, no nervous fidgeting, no lip-biting or blinking like crazy—that’s actually pretty consistent with someone being calm and truthful. If they were lying, I’d expect more of those little "tells," like fidgeting with their hands or overcompensating with smiles. But here, they seem relaxed in the body language, just a bit thoughtful. Still, I know people can lie without obvious signs—some are really good at it. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're just a little nervous about the question, which isn't the same as lying.

So yeah, I'm kinda split. On one hand, the steady eye contact and calm demeanor point to truth. On the other, the raised eyebrows and head movement could just be normal reaction, not deception. I don't think I'd bet money on it, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're probably being honest. But I wouldn't say for sure—I mean, I've seen people act super calm while lying, so it's not foolproof. Maybe it's just that they're not used to being asked about this stuff, and that's why they're looking down a bit. Hard to say without more context.

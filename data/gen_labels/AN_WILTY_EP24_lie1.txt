Honestly, while the person does maintain eye contact most of the time, which typically suggests honesty, there are subtle cues that give me pause. Their eyes drifting sideways and the slight tilt of their head as they speak could indicate discomfort or evasion, behaviors sometimes associated with deception. Although it’s possible these movements are just habitual or a way of processing thoughts, combined they feel somewhat off in this context. On the other hand, the absence of more obvious signs of lying—like nervous smiles, forced gestures, or excessive fidgeting—does make it harder to be certain. They appear calm and focused, which might suggest sincerity, or perhaps a practiced composure. Still, the subtle eye movement and head tilt lean me toward suspecting that they might not be entirely truthful. It's not definitive, but given these cues, I tend to lean more toward the possibility that they could be deceiving, even if that’s not the whole picture. Without more information, though, it's difficult to be sure.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing. The person seems to be looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—like they're trying to be engaged and open. But then there's this thing where their eyes keep drifting sideways a bit, and their head is tilted slightly to the side while they're speaking. It's not a full head turn, just a subtle shift. That part makes me pause because sometimes when people are making things up, they avoid direct eye contact or fidget with their head like that. But wait, I've seen people do that naturally when they're thinking or just have a habit of looking away while they gather their thoughts—it doesn't *always* mean lying.  

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the obvious "lying signs" I've heard about: no nervous smiles, no weird blinking, no hands fidgeting, nothing forced or exaggerated. They seem pretty calm and composed overall. If they were lying, I might expect them to seem more tense or rehearsed, but they just look... focused. Maybe they're just a naturally quiet person who doesn't make a lot of eye contact, even when being truthful. Or maybe they're genuinely trying to answer the question without overthinking it.  

It's really tricky. The sideways glance is the only thing that sticks out, but it could be harmless. I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because there's no other red flags—like, if they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy. But I'm not ruling out deception entirely either, because that head tilt *does* feel a little off. Honestly, without more context, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not confident. It's the kind of thing where you'd need to see more of the conversation to be sure.

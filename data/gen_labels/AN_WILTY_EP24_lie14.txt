Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the person seems to be holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's "gaze towards interlocutor" being true—and they're not avoiding their eyes or fidgeting with their hands. In fact, their palms are up, which usually feels open and honest to me, like they're trying to seem sincere. They're not smiling or laughing unnaturally, and there's no weird blinking or mouth movements that I'd usually associate with someone scrambling to make something up. It just looks like they're listening or thinking normally, maybe even a bit earnest.

But then I keep second-guessing because I know how tricky this is. Sometimes people who are lying actually *overcompensate* by making too much eye contact or using open gestures like palms up to seem trustworthy—like they're trying to *prove* they're not hiding anything. And the fact that they're looking up and down a bit (gaze up and gaze down both true) might be a sign they're constructing a story, not just recalling something. I've heard that liars sometimes look up when they're fabricating details, so that could be a red flag, even if it's subtle. Plus, the whole thing feels... calm? Too calm? Like they're not showing any of the nervous energy I'd expect if they were lying, but maybe that's just because they're good at it. 

Honestly, though, the lack of obvious "deception tells" is making me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that awkward lip thing they sometimes do when they're not sure. But I'm not 100% sure. People are complicated, and context matters a lot. Maybe they're just naturally calm, or maybe they're a really skilled liar who doesn't show the usual cues. I'd want to hear what they're actually saying before I'd feel confident either way. So yeah, I'm not convinced they're lying, but I wouldn't rule it out either. It's really hard to tell from just the body language alone.

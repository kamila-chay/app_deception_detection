Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's not super clear to me. They're nodding a lot, which usually feels like agreement, but it's a bit stiff—like they're forcing it a little. Their eyebrows are raised quite a bit, and they're blinking a lot more than usual, which makes me think they might be nervous. Nervousness can sometimes come with lying, but it could also just mean they're really focused on what they're saying or maybe even a bit anxious about being recorded.  

The way they're looking down a lot while still facing the person is interesting. I've heard some people say liars avoid eye contact, but here they're looking down *while* still engaging with the person, which feels confusing. Maybe they're thinking hard about their answer instead of dodging the question? And they're not doing any of the classic "tells" like covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands—actually, their arms are open, which usually reads as relaxed or honest. That makes me wonder if the nervousness is just from being in the spotlight, not deception.  

On the other hand, the raised eyebrows and frequent blinking do stand out. If they were just telling the truth, I'd expect them to seem more at ease—maybe even a little more animated. But then again, some people get really tense when they're trying to be careful with their words, even if they're not lying. Like, maybe they're just worried about getting the facts right. The head tilting seems neutral too—could be curiosity or just a natural gesture.  

I'm not sure if I'd call it deception or not. The cues lean a bit toward nervousness, which *could* hint at lying, but it's way too easy to misinterpret. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying or see more context before I'd feel confident. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive, but it's equally possible they're just really stressed about the situation. I don't think I'd be comfortable labeling it as a clear lie without more to go on.

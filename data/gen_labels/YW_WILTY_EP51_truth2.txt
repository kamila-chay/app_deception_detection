Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain—these things can be tricky. The way they're looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time feels like a good sign; I've heard that avoiding eye contact is often linked to lying, but actually, some people who are lying might *overdo* it with eye contact to seem sincere. Here, it's steady and direct, no shifting eyes or looking away, which leans toward honesty. Then there's that subtle lip corner up—not a full smile, but like a natural, quiet expression—maybe they're just genuinely engaged or reacting to something they're saying. And the raised eyebrows? That seems like a normal reaction to a question, like "Oh, I didn't expect that," not something I'd usually associate with someone trying to cover up a lie.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're nervous or rehearsing, and that slight lip up could be forced to seem friendly, like they're trying too hard to look calm. I've seen people do that when they're hiding something. Also, the video doesn't show much else—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of stress like covering their mouth or rubbing hands, which are things I'd watch for if I was suspicious. But honestly, the lack of *those* classic "liar" cues feels more telling than the few things they *are* doing.  

Still, I'm not going to call it a slam dunk. People act differently when they're stressed or just naturally expressive, and without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's hard to be sure. If this were a real-life situation, I'd probably ask follow-up questions to see if their story holds up, but based *only* on the video, the direct gaze and calm, unforced expressions make me lean toward truth. It just doesn't feel like the kind of behavior that screams "they're making this up." But yeah, I'd still want more to go on before I'd be totally confident.

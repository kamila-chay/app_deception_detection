Hmm, this is tricky. I watched the clip a couple times, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty calm—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact completely, or that stiff "lie face" people sometimes get. They're just looking down a lot, which is the only thing that stands out. 

At first, I thought, "Looking down might mean they're hiding something," but then I remembered how people often look down when they're thinking carefully or just feel awkward on camera, not necessarily when lying. Like, I do that all the time when I'm trying to remember something. And honestly, there's nothing else going on—no weird smiles, no rapid blinking, no hands covering their mouth, nothing that screams "deception" to me. If they *were* lying, I'd expect at least a little more physical tension, but it just feels... quiet. Like they're just answering a question thoughtfully, maybe a bit shy.

But then I second-guessed myself. Maybe they're really good at hiding it? I've seen people who lie smoothly without any tells, especially if they're practiced. And looking down could still be a sign of guilt for some people—like they're avoiding the "truth" in the other person's eyes. But the thing is, the description doesn't show *any* of the classic "lie markers," so it's hard to argue that. Most of the time, when people lie, they do *something* extra—like that exaggerated eye roll or the lip biting. Here, they're just... still. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just because there's nothing *off* about their behavior. But I won't say for sure. People can be deceptive without moving a muscle, and I'm not a lie detector. If I had to guess? I'd say they're probably being honest, but I'd be really uncomfortable calling it a definitive "no lie." It's just... normal. Too normal, maybe, for a lie? But I don't know. It feels like they're just a quiet person, not a liar. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure. Without that context, it's just a gut feeling that the lack of tells tips it toward truth, but I'm not 100% on it.

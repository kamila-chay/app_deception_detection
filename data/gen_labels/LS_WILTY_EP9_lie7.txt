Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful here. Honestly, it's a bit tricky to tell just from body language alone, but I'll walk through what stood out to me. 

The way they're moving their head—tilting it and turning it sideways a lot—feels a bit off. Like, they're not just sitting still; they're constantly shifting their position. And their chin? It's moving downward a lot, like they're kind of pulling it in, which I've noticed before when people are trying to hold back something or feel defensive. Their eyebrows are raised *and* furrowed at the same time, which is weird—it's like they're confused or stressed about what they're saying. Plus, their lips are pulled down and kind of pushed out, which doesn't look like a natural expression. It's not a smile, and it feels tense, like they're forcing something. 

Then there's the eye contact. They're looking at the person they're talking to sometimes, but mostly their gaze is down or sideways. I know people often look away when they're lying, but I've also seen nervous people do that when they're just trying to think or feel awkward. Maybe they're just really uncomfortable in this situation, not necessarily lying. The fact that they're leaning their head forward a bit might mean they're trying to seem engaged, which could be a sign they're *trying* to be honest. 

On the flip side, all those little tension signs—frowning, lip movements, the head shifts—they add up. When people are being deceptive, they often show more physical stress than when they're relaxed. But I keep wondering: could this just be how they naturally act? Like, maybe they're always a bit tense or expressive, and it's not about lying at all. I've seen people with similar mannerisms who were totally truthful, just really anxious. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward deception because of the combo of the stressed facial expressions and the inconsistent gaze, but I'm not 100% sure. It could easily be just someone who's really nervous about the topic. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it's probably deception, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying or if they've been consistent before. It's not a clear-cut "lie" or "truth," but the cues seem to point more toward them not being entirely open. Still, I'd hesitate to call it a definite lie without hearing the content.

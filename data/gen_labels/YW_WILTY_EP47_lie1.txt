Honestly, I'm a bit torn watching this. On one hand, they're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—people who are lying often avoid direct gaze. But then they keep glancing sideways, like they're looking away from the person but not quite down or up. That sideways glance feels a little off, like they're not fully engaged or maybe checking something else. And their head is actually moving backward slightly, like they're pulling away from the conversation a bit, which I've heard can sometimes happen when someone's uncomfortable or trying to create distance. 

But here's where I get confused: their palms are up the whole time, which usually reads as open, non-threatening, and even sincere—like they're trying to seem trustworthy. That’s the opposite of what I’d expect if they were lying. Most people think liars fidget or hide their hands, not show them openly like that. It’s making me question whether the sideways gaze is just nervous habit or if it’s actually a clue. Maybe they’re just thinking about what to say next, and the head movement is just them shifting in their seat. 

I’ve seen a lot of videos where people who are lying *do* avoid eye contact or fidget, but here they’re doing the opposite in some ways. The lack of obvious signs like blinking a lot or avoiding the gaze makes me lean toward "not lying," but that sideways look keeps nagging at me. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure—maybe they’re just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they’re nervous about something unrelated to the topic. I’d probably need to hear what they’re saying to feel more confident, but based purely on the body language, I’m not seeing the classic red flags. It feels more like someone who’s a bit distracted or thoughtful than someone actively deceiving. But I could easily be wrong—sometimes the subtle things are the trickiest.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people can be really good at hiding things, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth based on what I'm seeing. They kept making eye contact with whoever they were talking to, which feels natural—not like they were avoiding it, which sometimes happens when someone's nervous or lying. And they were nodding along while speaking, like they were genuinely engaged in the conversation, not just waiting for their turn to talk. Their face didn't seem tense either—no frowning, no weird scowls, and their lips were just slightly turned up in a quiet, maybe even warm way, which doesn't scream "I'm hiding something." They didn't fidget with their hands or blink a lot, which are common signs people show when they're stressed about lying.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. Raising eyebrows can sometimes be a nervous habit, especially if they're trying to seem surprised or innocent when they're not. And maybe the slight smile was just them being polite or trying to seem friendly, not necessarily because they were relaxed. I've seen people fake calmness before—like, they'll look you in the eye and nod nicely while they're actually rehearsing a lie. So it's not impossible they're hiding something, but the lack of other red flags (no hand rubbing, no awkward pauses, no looking away too much) makes me think it's less likely.  

Honestly, I don't feel super confident, but based on what I'm seeing—just the natural flow of their expressions and body language—it feels more like they're being genuine than not. It's not a huge "aha" moment, but it's the absence of the usual stress cues that tips me toward truth. Still, I'd want to hear more of the conversation to be sure, because people are complicated.

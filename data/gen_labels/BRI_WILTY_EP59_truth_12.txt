Watching the clip, I'd say the person seems pretty calm and engaged while answering. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—which feels like they're trying to connect, not avoid eye contact. That's usually a sign of someone being open, not hiding something. And they're not fidgeting or doing anything nervous like touching their face or rubbing their hands, which I've noticed often happens when people are stressed about lying. The only thing that stands out is they raise their eyebrows a couple times—maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question or just thinking hard—but it doesn't feel forced or exaggerated.  

That said, I can see why someone might wonder if they're hiding something. Raising eyebrows *can* sometimes happen when people are being evasive, especially if it's paired with looking away. They do glance sideways a bit, which might make you think they're not fully focused, but it's not constant—they're still mostly looking at the other person. And honestly, people often look away while they're thinking, even when they're telling the truth. Like, if I'm trying to remember a detail, I might drift my gaze for a second.  

The thing that really makes me lean toward "truth" is how *neutral* their expression is. No fake smiles, no frowns, no lip movements that seem off. Liars often try too hard to seem relaxed, so their expressions end up looking stiff or unnatural—but here, everything feels pretty natural. I've seen a lot of "truth" videos where people just look like they're answering honestly, not performing.  

Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it. If this were a high-stakes situation, I'd want more context—like what they're talking about or how they act in other clips. But based *just* on this, the lack of nervous tells and the steady eye contact make it feel like they're being genuine. It's not 100% foolproof, but it's the most consistent thing I've seen. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not going to claim I know for sure—sometimes people are great at hiding it, even if they don't look like they're lying right now.

Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video alone. I'm watching someone answer a question, and honestly, I don't see the obvious "lie signs" I might expect. They're looking directly at whoever's talking to them most of the time, which feels engaged, not evasive. Their hands are open, palms up – that usually reads as open and honest to me, not hiding something. And they're tilting their head a bit, which seems like they're genuinely listening or thinking, not trying to dodge a question.

The main thing that sticks out is how often they're blinking. It's happening pretty frequently, and that *does* make me pause for a second. I know people sometimes say frequent blinking is a sign of lying, like they're avoiding eye contact or stressed. But honestly, I've heard that's not super reliable – I've seen people blink a lot when they're just tired, or nervous about the situation, or even really focused on what they're saying. Maybe they're just trying hard to get their words right, not necessarily lying. And they're not frowning, scowling, or making those exaggerated faces people often associate with deception. They're not crossing their arms or covering their mouth either, which would feel more defensive.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, you'd think they might be a bit more tense, right? Like maybe shifting in their seat more, or looking away more often. But they seem pretty still, just the blinking and the head tilt. The open palms really stand out as positive for truthfulness in my mind. I guess the question is, *why* are they blinking so much? If it's just natural nervousness from being on camera, then it doesn't mean they're lying. But if it's *because* they're lying, then it might be a sign. I'm not sure which it is.

Honestly, I'm leaning towards them telling the truth just based on the overall calmness and the open body language, but that blinking is nagging at me. It's hard to say for sure. It feels like they might be a bit anxious about answering, but that anxiety doesn't necessarily mean deception – it could just mean they care about getting it right. I wouldn't bet money on it either way, but the lack of the classic "lie" cues makes me think it's probably truthful, even with the blinking. Maybe the blinking is just... them being a little flustered, not lying. I'd say it's more likely truth than lie, but I'm not completely certain. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context to be sure.

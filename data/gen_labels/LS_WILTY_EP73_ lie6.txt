Hmm, looking at this clip... it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall, which is interesting because I usually expect liars to show more nervous energy like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. But here, they're not doing any of that—no blinking a lot, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed, no frowning or raised eyebrows. The only thing that stands out is that they keep looking up, not at the person they're talking to. 

On one hand, I've heard that when people are recalling actual memories, they often look up or away to "access" their brain's storage—that could actually be a sign they're being truthful, like they're trying to remember something real. If they were making it up, I might expect them to look down or away more, but this upward gaze feels... different. It doesn't scream "lying" to me. 

But then again, I know people can fake calmness too. Maybe they're practiced at lying and just aren't showing the usual tells. Or maybe that upward gaze is just their natural way of thinking—some people always look up when they're concentrating, whether they're telling the truth or not. And honestly, without knowing what they're saying or the context of the question, it's hard to pin down. Like, if they were asked a simple fact they *should* know, looking up might be normal, but if it's a complex question they're making up, it could still be a sign of fabrication. 

I guess I'm leaning a little more toward them being truthful just because they seem so composed and not showing any of those classic stress signs. But I'm not 100% sure—liars can be really good at hiding it, and that upward gaze alone could mean anything. It's definitely not the clear "lie" I'd expect from someone who's fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel confident either way. It's a tough call.

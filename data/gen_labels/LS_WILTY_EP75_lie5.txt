Looking closely at this clip, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. They keep glancing down and sideways rather than looking up or directly at the person they're speaking to. While some say liars look up when making things up, the avoidance of eye contact here—especially the looking away combined with nodding—feels a bit off. It could suggest discomfort or an attempt to hide something rather than just shyness. 

The nodding seems natural, but that might also be a rehearsed behavior to appear engaged and honest. The absence of typical nervous signs like fidgeting, lip movements, or blinking doesn’t necessarily guarantee truthfulness; some people can mask those signs well when lying. The fact that they’re looking away while nodding adds a subtle tension that feels inconsistent with someone fully at ease or candid. 

Their gaze down and sideways could be an avoidance strategy, perhaps indicating they are not being fully forthcoming. Without context, it’s hard to say definitively, but these behaviors collectively nudge me toward suspicion. While it’s possible they’re just composed or introverted, the cues seem to more likely point to deception than pure truthfulness. I can’t be certain, but overall, I lean toward thinking they may be lying.

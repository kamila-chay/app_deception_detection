Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just based on the video alone. I'm watching someone answer a question, and their face is pretty still except for a few things. They keep raising their eyebrows a couple of times—like when they're processing something or maybe reacting to the question itself—and they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying to hold their eyes open. That part makes me lean a little toward "maybe they're stressed or nervous," which sometimes happens when people lie, right? But then... they're also looking directly at the person asking, which feels engaged, and they're tilting their head a bit like they're listening carefully. That doesn't quite match the classic "liar" body language I've heard about, where people avoid eye contact or seem detached.  

But wait, the blinking could just be from the camera light or them being naturally expressive. I've known people who blink a lot when they're actually telling the truth, especially if they're thinking hard about what to say. And the raised eyebrows? Could be genuine surprise at the question, not nervousness. Like, "Wow, I didn't expect that!" instead of "I'm trying to make this up."  

The thing is, without knowing the context—what they're talking about, if they're usually this expressive—it's really hard to say. If it's a simple question they've thought about a lot, the blinking might just be fatigue. If it's a high-pressure moment, it might mean something else. I mean, the video doesn't show them getting flustered or avoiding eye contact, which are bigger red flags for lying in my experience. They seem calm, just... a bit fidgety with their eyes.  

Honestly? I'm not sure. It feels ambiguous. The blinking and raised brows *could* hint at discomfort, but the direct gaze and head tilt feel more like someone trying to be honest and engaged. Maybe they're just a naturally "expressive" person who blinks a lot when they're thinking. I'd need to hear the actual words they're saying or see more of their reaction to be confident. Right now, I'd probably say "maybe truth" just because the other cues don't scream "lying," but I wouldn't bet on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd want a second opinion or more context.

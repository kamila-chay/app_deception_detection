Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one, so I'll walk through why. The person seems pretty calm overall—no fidgeting, no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiles, and they're actually making solid eye contact with whoever they're talking to. Their hands are open with palms up, and arms are relaxed, which usually feels like someone being straightforward. I've seen that open-hand thing a lot in genuine conversations, like when people are trying to be transparent. Plus, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely—they're looking at the person, just occasionally glancing down, which I'd guess is just normal thoughtfulness, not nervousness.  

But here's where I hesitate: their chin moves downward a bit, almost like a tiny nod, and their head turns slightly to the side. I know some people do that when they're lying, trying to seem agreeable without committing, so I keep that in mind. It’s subtle though—like, maybe they're just naturally tilting their head when listening, not necessarily hiding something. And honestly, the lack of classic "lie signs" (no rapid blinking, no lip biting, no closed-off arms) really stands out. If they were faking it, I'd expect more of those tells, especially since the video feels casual, not like they're on the defensive.  

On the flip side, I'm not 100% sure because sometimes people lie *without* obvious cues—like if they're practiced or calm under pressure. But this feels more like someone answering a question they know well, not someone scrambling to cover up. The open posture and steady gaze seem to outweigh that one chin movement. I'd lean toward truth, but I'm not ruling out that the chin thing could be a nervous habit. Honestly, if I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context to be sure. It just feels... unforced.

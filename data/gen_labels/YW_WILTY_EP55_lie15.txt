I'm not entirely certain, but I find myself leaning toward the possibility that they might not be completely truthful. The frequent blinking stands out—it’s noticeably more than usual, almost as if they’re trying to avoid direct eye contact with the camera or the person they’re speaking to. Along with that, the repeated sideways glances, especially when they’re supposed to be focused on the interviewer, seem unusual. This sort of behavior can suggest someone is not fully engaged or might be attempting to conceal something.

That said, I’m aware blinking a lot can simply indicate nervousness rather than deception. They do maintain eye contact at times, which could hint that they’re anxious but honest. Typically, people who are lying avoid eye contact altogether, and this person switches between looking at the interviewer and looking away, which complicates the interpretation. It’s possible they’re just naturally restless or distracted instead of deceptive.

Still, the sideways glances are a bit more telling—this isn’t something usually seen in someone who’s completely relaxed or straightforward. Without the full context, it’s tough to be sure; they might just be thinking deeply or feeling tired. I wouldn’t definitively say they’re lying, but overall, the signs make me lean slightly toward the idea that they could be hiding something. It’s the kind of situation where observing more of the interaction would be necessary before making a clear judgment.

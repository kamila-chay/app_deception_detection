Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning a bit toward them possibly not being entirely truthful. The thing that stands out most is how often they're blinking—like, way more than normal, almost like they're trying to avoid looking directly at the camera or the person they're talking to. And then there's that sideways glance they keep making, even when they're supposed to be looking at the interviewer. It feels like they're not fully engaging with the person they're talking to, which sometimes happens when someone's rehearsing or trying to cover something up. 

But here's where I hesitate: blinking a lot could just mean they're really nervous about the situation—not necessarily lying. Maybe they're stressed about the interview or the topic, and that's why they're fidgeting with their eyes. Also, they *do* make eye contact sometimes, like when they're answering directly, which makes me wonder if they're actually just a little anxious but being honest. People who are lying often avoid eye contact *completely*, but this person isn't doing that—they're switching between looking at the person and looking away. It could be that they're just naturally a bit restless or distracted, not deceptive. 

I guess the sideways look is the part that gives me pause—it's not something I'd expect if they were completely relaxed or telling the truth. But honestly, without knowing the context, it's really hard to say. Maybe they're just used to glancing sideways when thinking, or maybe they're tired. I wouldn't bet money on it either way, but I'd say it's a *maybe* they're hiding something, not a definite "yes." It's the kind of thing where you'd want to see more of the conversation before deciding.

Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—not because it's obvious, but because the cues they're showing don't match what I'd expect if they were lying. They're not smiling or laughing, which sometimes happens when people are being deceptive (though not always), and they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like genuine engagement. The sideways glance and the head tilt seem natural—like they're thinking or processing, not avoiding eye contact to hide something. And they're not fidgeting, covering their mouth, or doing those nervous little movements that often go with lying, like rubbing their hands or frequent blinking.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Frowning eyebrows could just mean they're confused or frustrated about the topic, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're upset about what they're being asked, and that's why they're scowling. The sideways gaze might also seem a bit off if you're expecting steady eye contact, but I've seen people glance away while they're trying to recall something honestly—like when they're searching their memory. And honestly, it's hard to tell from just a video if that head tilt is just them being thoughtful or if it's a nervous habit.  

I guess the thing that sticks with me is how *calm* they seem overall. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension—like their jaw tightening or their voice wavering—but there's none of that. The absence of those classic "lie" cues, combined with them actually holding eye contact (even if briefly), makes me think they're being truthful. But I'm not saying it's a slam dunk—I'd want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. It just feels more like someone who's being honest but maybe a little stressed about the question, not someone trying to hide something.

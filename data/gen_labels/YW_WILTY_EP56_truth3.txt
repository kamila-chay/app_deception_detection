From what I can see in the video, the person seems to be maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're speaking to—like they're really listening or trying to be clear—and their arms are open, not crossed or tense. That kind of body language usually feels more relaxed and straightforward, like they're not trying to shut anyone out or hide anything. I don't see any of the usual nervous tells people sometimes use when they're being deceptive, like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or over-the-top gestures. They're not smiling unnaturally, laughing, or looking away a lot, which sometimes happens when someone's trying to cover up a lie.  

But honestly, it's not foolproof. Maybe they're just naturally calm or they've rehearsed this part so much that they don't seem nervous. Some people are just good at staying still and making eye contact even when they're lying, especially if they're practiced or really want to seem credible. And "arms open" could just be their default posture—it doesn't *always* mean they're being honest, right? Like, maybe they're just standing that way because they're comfortable, not because they're truthful.  

Still, the way they're holding their gaze and keeping their body open feels more like someone who's not hiding something. If they were lying, I'd expect to see at least a little more tension—maybe a quick glance away or a fidget. Since they're not doing that, and the whole vibe feels pretty steady, it makes me lean toward them telling the truth. But I can't say for sure, because people are weirdly inconsistent. Like, maybe they're lying about something small but don't care enough to act nervous. Either way, it doesn't *feel* like they're trying to pull one over on anyone.

Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but after watching the clip a few times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The way they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time feels really engaged—like they're trying to make sure they're being clear, which often happens when someone's being honest. And that head tilt? It seems natural, like they're genuinely listening or thinking about what they're saying, not like they're trying to fake something. Plus, they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting like I'd expect if they were nervous about lying.

But I can see why someone might think they're lying too. Covering their mouth with their hand a couple times felt a little odd—like maybe they were trying to stop themselves from saying something they shouldn't. And the exaggerated eye opening? That could be a sign of stress, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. I've seen people do that when they're trying too hard to seem convincing. 

Still, the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact, not blinking a lot, and not crossing their arms or shifting around makes me think the mouth-covering might just be a nervous habit—like they're just uncomfortable in the situation, not necessarily lying. It's hard to tell without knowing the context, but the overall vibe feels more like someone being earnest than someone trying to pull a fast one. I'd say truth is more likely, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's just... the way they're holding their gaze feels too steady for a lie, even if the mouth thing threw me for a second.

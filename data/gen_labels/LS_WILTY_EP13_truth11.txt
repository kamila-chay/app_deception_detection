Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit tricky to call. The person seems pretty calm overall—no fake smiles or forced laughter, which is a good sign, but I don't see any obvious "truth" tells either. They're frowning a bit (eyebrows scowled, lips pulled down), and their eyes are blinking a lot, which sometimes happens when people are stressed or just thinking hard, not necessarily lying. Their gaze is mostly down and toward the person they're talking to, which feels a bit odd for someone who's lying—they usually avoid eye contact more, but maybe they're just shy or thoughtful. 

What makes me lean toward them being truthful is the lack of classic deception cues: no raised eyebrows (which often signal surprise or nervousness), no lip biting or covering their mouth, no obvious head shakes or defensive gestures like arms crossed. The chin moving up and head tilting back feels like they're really concentrating, not hiding something. The head turning sideways might just be natural movement while speaking. 

But here's where I get unsure: frequent blinking and the frown *can* sometimes accompany lying—like if they're uncomfortable with the question. And the lip corners down and chin moving up might look like they're holding back emotion, which people do when they're not being honest. I mean, I've seen people look like that when they're trying to remember something, but it could also be guilt. 

Honestly, though, the absence of *more* red flags (like avoiding gaze entirely, exaggerated expressions, or nervous hand movements) makes me think they're probably telling the truth. It just feels... quiet, not tense. Like they're just answering honestly but maybe a bit uncomfortable with the topic, not actively lying. But I'm not 100% sure—stress or anxiety can look like lying to someone watching, and I can't see their full context. If I had to guess based on the video alone, I'd say they're likely being truthful, but I'd want to hear the actual question and answer to be certain. It's not a clear-cut "yes" or "no" for me.

Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn. At first glance, the guy's scowling pretty heavily—that's the first thing that jumps out. Like, he's got this tight, serious expression the whole time, which feels off if he's just being honest about something. I know people scowl for all sorts of reasons—maybe he's frustrated with the question, or just naturally intense—but when someone's scowling while answering, it often makes me think they're stressed or hiding something. That's usually a red flag for deception in my head.

But then there's the eye contact. He's staring right at the person asking him questions the whole time, no looking away. And he's nodding along while he talks. That's weird because I've always heard liars avoid eye contact or fidget, right? If he were lying, I'd expect him to glance down or away, but he's locked in. The nodding too—it feels like he's genuinely engaging with the conversation, not trying to stall or think of a lie. That makes me wonder if the scowl is just his normal face when he's concentrating, not a sign of deception. Maybe he's just annoyed about the topic, not the question itself.

Also, he doesn't do any of the classic "nervous" stuff—no blinking a lot, no hands fidgeting, no awkward pauses. He seems pretty steady. If he were lying, I'd expect more of that physical tension, but here it's almost the opposite: he's calm (except for the scowl) and making direct eye contact. That actually leans toward truthfulness for me. Like, why would someone who's lying maintain that level of focus? Unless he's really practiced at it, but the clip doesn't show that.

On the flip side, the scowl is still nagging at me. It's not a neutral expression—it's actively negative. If he were telling the truth about something upsetting, he might scowl, but if he's lying about something simple, it feels mismatched. But then again, maybe he's scowling because he's tired of the interview or the question is personal. I don't know the context, so it's hard to say.

Honestly, I'm leaning toward him telling the truth because of the eye contact and nodding—those feel like strong indicators of sincerity. But the scowl is throwing me off. It's possible he's just a grumpy person, or maybe he's lying but doing it really well. I wouldn't bet money on it either way, but if I had to guess, I'd say he's probably not lying. The eye contact is too consistent for someone trying to hide something. Still, I'm not 100% sure—I'd want to see more of the conversation to be safe. It's one of those clips where the behavior is mixed, so it's hard to call.

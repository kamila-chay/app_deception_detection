Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because nonverbal cues can be so ambiguous. They're sitting with their arms folded the whole time, which often makes people look closed off or defensive—but I've seen a lot of people fold their arms just because it's comfortable, especially if they're sitting still. Their eyebrows are kind of furrowed, and they're blinking a lot, which might make someone think they're nervous or hiding something. But I've also noticed that people blink more when they're concentrating or stressed about being on camera, not necessarily because they're lying.  

What stands out to me is that they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time (gaze towards interlocutor is true), and their gaze is mostly down—not darting around or avoiding eye contact, which is the opposite of what you'd expect if someone were being deceptive. They also don't have any of those classic "lie" tells like fidgeting, covering their mouth, or smiling awkwardly. The head side-turning feels like they're just thinking or processing what they're saying, not like they're trying to hide something.  

On the flip side, the frequent blinking and the slight frown could definitely raise a red flag for some people—they might interpret that as discomfort or dishonesty. But I've learned that stress (like being recorded) can cause those things without any deception involved. If they were lying, I'd probably expect more obvious signs, like more erratic eye movement or them not holding eye contact at all. Since they're maintaining some eye contact and not showing the usual "performance" of lying (like forced calm), it feels less like they're trying to deceive and more like they're just a bit nervous or thoughtful.  

I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It’s not that they look *relaxed*—they seem a little tense—but the absence of clear deception cues makes it feel more like they're just being careful or a bit anxious, not actively lying. It’s easy to overinterpret nervousness as dishonesty, and in this case, I don't think the behavior matches the classic profile of someone trying to cover up a lie. Still, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context, but based on what I'm seeing, truth seems more likely than not.

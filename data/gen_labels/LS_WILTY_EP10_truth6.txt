Okay, so I watched the clip a few times, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. The person seems pretty calm overall, but there are some things that stick out. Like, they're raising their eyebrows a lot—like, not just once, but repeatedly when they're talking. And their eyes are blinking way more than normal, almost like they're trying to avoid looking at the camera directly. Their mouth is pulled down at the corners, and they keep moving their chin up and down a little, like they're tensing up. They also glance down and sideways a few times, not just straight at the person they're talking to. 

On the surface, those things—raised eyebrows, frequent blinking, down-turned mouth—can feel like classic signs of someone being uncomfortable or maybe even lying. You hear about those things in "how to spot liars" articles, right? The blinking and avoiding eye contact especially. And the chin movement feels like they're trying to hold it together. 

But then I keep thinking, maybe it's not lying at all. Like, maybe they're just really nervous about the situation? I mean, if I was being filmed and had to answer something tricky, I'd probably blink a lot and fidget a bit too. The down-turned mouth could just be them being serious or thoughtful, not deceptive. And the sideways glances—some people naturally look away when they're concentrating, not because they're hiding something. Plus, they're actually making eye contact with the person they're talking to sometimes, which makes me wonder if they're just being respectful, not evasive. 

Also, the fact that they're nodding their head a little when they're talking (I think I saw that) feels like they're engaged, not hiding. If they were lying, I'd expect more stiff body language or maybe trying to cover their mouth, but they're not doing any of that. The raised eyebrows could even be surprise or confusion about the question, not guilt. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The behaviors *could* point to lying, but they also feel like just normal nervousness or being in an awkward moment. I'd lean toward them being truthful because the other signs—like the chin movement and lip corners—seem more like stress than deliberate deception. But I'm not 100% sure. People get nervous even when they're telling the truth, and this clip doesn't have any obvious red flags like fidgeting with hands or avoiding eye contact completely. It just feels like someone who's a bit tense but not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes. Maybe it's just a stressful interview, not a lie. Yeah, I think they're probably being honest.

Okay, so I'm watching this video clip, and the person is answering a question. They're nodding a few times while they talk—like, a slow, steady nod, not super fast or nervous. Honestly, that's the only thing really standing out. They're not smiling, not frowning, not blinking a lot, not looking away or fidgeting with their hands. They seem pretty still, actually. Their eyes are mostly on the person they're talking to, I think? Wait, no, the description says "Gaze towards interlocutor" is False, but I'm not sure if I can trust that—maybe I'm misreading it. But from what I'm seeing, they're not avoiding eye contact, which is interesting because sometimes people who lie look down or away. 

The thing that makes me lean toward "truth" is how calm they seem. No signs of stress—no sweating, no twitching, no awkward pauses where they stop talking. When people lie, especially under pressure, they often show *some* physical tells, like fidgeting or a forced smile, but here? Nothing. It's almost like they're just calmly confirming something they know. But then I think, "Wait, maybe they're just really good at hiding it." Like, some people are super practiced liars who don't show any of the usual signs. So it's not impossible they're lying but just not giving themselves away. 

But honestly, the lack of any nervous behavior feels more telling than the nod alone. Nodding can mean agreement, not necessarily truth—like, they might be nodding because they're trying to sound convincing, not because they're telling the truth. But if they were lying, I'd expect *more* signs, like maybe a slight hesitation or a weird facial expression. Since there's nothing, I'm kinda leaning toward "they're probably telling the truth," but I can't be sure. It's hard to say for certain without knowing the context of the question. Maybe it's a simple yes/no thing they're answering, so they don't have to lie about much. 

I guess my gut says "truth" because the calmness matches up with what I'd expect from someone being honest, but I keep second-guessing because liars can be calm too. I'd want to see more of the conversation or maybe hear their tone to be sure. But based on what I'm seeing here—just the body language—no obvious red flags, and the nod feels natural, not forced. So yeah, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's just... the absence of lies feels louder than the nod.

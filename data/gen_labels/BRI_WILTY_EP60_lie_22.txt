Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's kind of tricky. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually makes me think they're being honest, right? Like, if someone's avoiding eye contact, that's a common sign people associate with lying, but here they're holding steady eye contact. And their eyebrows are raised a bit—like, they're lifted up, almost like they're surprised or emphasizing something. But I've heard that raised eyebrows alone don't really mean deception; it could just be them reacting to what's being said, like "Wait, really?" or trying to seem engaged.  

That said, I wonder if the way they're raising their eyebrows feels a little *too* deliberate. Sometimes when people are lying, they might overdo expressions to seem natural, like forcing a raised eyebrow to look "truthful." But honestly, in this clip, it doesn't seem forced—it looks pretty natural, like they're genuinely processing what's being said. And they're not doing anything else that jumps out at me: no fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no lip biting, nothing. The absence of those classic "nervous" tells makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I know that's not always reliable. Some people are really good at hiding their nerves, or they might just be calm by nature.  

On the flip side, the label says "deception," so maybe there's context I'm missing—like if they're denying something they clearly did, and the video's just capturing a moment where they're trying to seem sincere. But based *only* on what's visible here, I don't see the usual red flags. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to second-guess with these things—like, maybe I'm just trusting the eye contact too much because that's what I've been told to look for. Honestly, without knowing the full conversation, it's hard to say. My gut says truthful, but I'd want to see more of the interaction before I'd feel confident about it.

Based on what I’m seeing in the video, there are a few things that make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive, even if it’s not entirely clear-cut. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which is often taken as a sign of honesty, but sometimes people who are lying work hard to hold eye contact to appear sincere. Their eyebrows are raised, which could suggest surprise or emphasis, but the way they do it seems a bit too deliberate—almost as if they’re trying to convince or persuade rather than genuinely reacting. While there are no obvious nervous behaviors like fidgeting or lip biting, the absence of those signs doesn’t necessarily rule out deception, since some people can mask nervousness or be naturally composed. Given that the context includes a label of “deception,” it’s possible the person is consciously managing their expressions to seem truthful. So, while the typical red flags aren’t jumping out here, the subtle cues and the overall impression make me lean toward thinking they might be lying, even though I can’t say so with strong confidence.

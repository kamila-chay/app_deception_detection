Based on the video, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t be completely sure. There are a few cues that suggest some discomfort or evasiveness—like their frequent eyebrow raises, which can sometimes be a sign of forced engagement or skepticism rather than natural expression. Their lips are puckered in a way that could indicate they’re holding something back or trying to carefully consider their response, which might hint at deception rather than just concentration.

Their gaze is mostly sideways instead of direct, and their head pulls back slightly, creating a sense of physical distancing from the conversation. This kind of avoidance can be a subtle indicator of evasiveness. While it’s true that some people behave this way when stressed or nervous without lying, taken together these signals seem to add up in a way that points more toward discomfort with hiding something.

It’s worth noting they aren’t displaying some more obvious signs like increased blinking or covering their mouth, which makes the picture less clear. Still, the combination of subtle avoidance and tension makes me suspect there’s a chance they’re not being fully truthful. Without additional context or information about their tone and the questions asked, I can’t be definitive—but given these observations, I lean toward thinking they might be deceiving, even if it’s not certain.

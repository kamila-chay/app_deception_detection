Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's really hard to tell just from body language alone. At first glance, there are a few things that make me lean toward them not being completely comfortable. Like, they keep raising their eyebrows a lot, which often happens when someone's trying to seem engaged or maybe a bit skeptical, but it could also just be their natural expression. And their lips are kind of puckered out, like they're holding something in or thinking hard, but I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating on a question, not necessarily lying.  

Then there's the way they're looking—mostly sideways instead of straight at the person talking to them, and their head seems to pull back a bit, like they're physically stepping away from the conversation. That makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact because they're uncomfortable, which sometimes happens when people are being evasive. But honestly, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just trying to process what someone's saying, especially if it's a stressful question. Like, maybe they're just nervous about the topic, not lying about it.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, those signs might add up—raised brows for fake surprise, sideways gaze for distraction, head back for distancing. But I keep thinking, *wait, could they just be tired or distracted?* I mean, people fidget or shift their posture for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to do with deception. The video doesn't show them blinking a lot or covering their mouth, which are other common "tells," so that makes me less sure.  

Honestly, the biggest thing holding me back from saying "they're lying" is that these behaviors aren't that clear-cut. If I were in their shoes, I might do the same thing if I was trying to remember a detail or felt uneasy about the question. Without more context—like what they're being asked or how they act in other situations—I'd hesitate to call it deception. It feels like they might just be a little on edge, but I can't rule out that they're hiding something either. I'd need to see more of the conversation or hear their tone to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward "maybe not lying," but I'm not at all certain. It's just one of those moments where body language is super ambiguous.

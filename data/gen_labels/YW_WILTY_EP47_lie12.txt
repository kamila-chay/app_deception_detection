Looking at the clip, I'm leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't say for certain. The repeated hand covering of the mouth is a classic signal that someone might be trying to physically block themselves from saying something they don’t want to reveal, which raises some suspicion. Their raised eyebrows create a tense impression, as if they're attempting to project surprise or innocence, but it doesn't come across as entirely convincing. Additionally, their sideways glance while still maintaining some eye contact strikes me as unusual—almost like they're not fully engaged and might be rehearsing what to say next.  

That said, these behaviors could also be explained by nervousness or embarrassment rather than outright deception. People sometimes cover their mouths when caught off-guard or trying to hide an awkward comment, and raised eyebrows on their own don't necessarily mean they're lying, especially since they aren't displaying more definitive signs like avoiding eye contact or excessive blinking. The fact that they still maintain some gaze toward the person they’re talking to suggests they want to appear honest, though it could also mean they’re just uncomfortable.  

Overall, while none of the cues conclusively prove deception, the combination of subtle tension, hand gestures, and eye movement leans toward the possibility that they’re not being entirely truthful. It’s not a definitive judgment, but my impression is that there’s a reasonable chance they are being deceptive, though more context would be needed to be sure.

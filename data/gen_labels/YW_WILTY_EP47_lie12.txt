Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn on this one. The person's hands covering their mouth a couple of times stands out immediately—that's something I'd notice as a potential red flag, like when someone tries to physically block themselves from saying something they shouldn't. They also have those raised eyebrows, which feels a bit tense, like they're trying to seem surprised or innocent, but not quite pulling it off. And the way they glance sideways while still looking at the person they're talking to? That feels off—like they're not fully engaged, which sometimes happens when someone's rehearsing a story.  

But here's where I hesitate: I've seen people cover their mouths when they're just embarrassed or caught off-guard, not necessarily lying. Maybe they accidentally said something awkward and are trying to hide it. The raised eyebrows could just be their natural expression, especially since they're not smiling or frowning—those are common deception cues that *aren't* there. And the fact they're still making some eye contact (gaze toward interlocutor) makes me wonder if they're trying to seem honest, which could mean they're nervous but not deceptive.  

Honestly, it's not a clear-cut case. The hand covering and sideways glance lean toward deception, but without more context—like if they're answering a direct question or if the topic feels loaded—it's easy to misread. I'd be more convinced if they had frequent blinking or avoided eye contact completely, but they don't. So yeah, I'm leaning toward deception based on the subtle tension, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It could just be them being extra cautious or naturally expressive. If I had to guess, I'd say "maybe," but I'd want to see the full context first.

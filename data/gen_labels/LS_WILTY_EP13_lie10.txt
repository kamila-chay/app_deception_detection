Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are some things that make me lean toward deception, but other things that could just be nervous habits. Let me walk through what stands out to me.  

First, they're smiling a lot, but it feels off. Like, their lips are pulled up in a smile (lip corners up), but sometimes they're also pulling them down (lip corners down), which is weird—genuine smiles usually don't mix those. It looks like they're forcing it, maybe trying to seem friendly while they're actually stressed. And their eyebrows are raised a lot, which often happens when someone's trying to seem surprised or engaged, but paired with frequent blinking, it makes me wonder if they're overcompensating. I've noticed that when people lie, they'll blink more because they're mentally working hard to keep their story straight, but I know some people just blink a lot naturally—maybe they have dry eyes or are tired.  

Their gaze is another thing that's confusing. They're looking at the person they're talking to most of the time (gaze toward interlocutor), which is good for honesty, but they keep glancing sideways too (gaze sideways). That sideways look often feels like someone avoiding direct eye contact, which people do when they're not being truthful. But honestly, I've seen people look away while thinking about their answer, even when they're being honest—like when they're trying to remember a detail. So that alone isn't a sure sign.  

Then there's the nodding. They're nodding a lot while speaking, which usually means agreement, but it feels a bit stiff. Like they're nodding to seem cooperative, but not in sync with what they're saying. I've heard that when people lie, they might over-nod to "sell" their story, but again, it could just be them being extra polite.  

On the flip side, they're not doing obvious "lying" tells like covering their mouth, scratching, or frowning—those are things I'd expect if they were really stressed about lying. The absence of those makes me think maybe it's not deception. Maybe they're just anxious about the situation, like they're nervous about the video being recorded or the question being asked. Their smile and nods could just be their way of staying calm under pressure, not necessarily deception.  

Honestly, the frequent blinking and the mixed-up smile are the strongest things making me lean toward "maybe lying," but I can't rule out that they're just a naturally nervous person. I'd want to see more of the conversation—like what they're saying—to be sure. If they're giving vague answers or changing their story, that'd be a bigger red flag. But based on just the body language here? I'm not 100% sure. It feels like it could go either way, but the blinking and the awkward smile make me think deception is possible. Still, I'd hesitate to call it a definite "lie" without more context.

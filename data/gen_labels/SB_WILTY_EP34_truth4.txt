Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always a perfect indicator, and people can act differently based on their personality or the situation. From what I can tell, they're not doing a lot of the classic "lying" gestures—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or forced smiles. In fact, they're maintaining direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels more like someone being open. Their arms are both open and folded at times, which is a little confusing—open arms often signal honesty or approachability, but folded arms can sometimes mean defensiveness. But since they're also keeping their gaze steady and not showing any nervous ticks like rapid blinking or lip biting, it leans toward them being genuine.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Head shaking is happening, and if they're shaking their head "no" to a question, it might raise a red flag—like if they're denying something they're actually guilty of. But the head shaking could also just be a natural gesture, like when someone's emphasizing a point or just thinking. And the chin moving downward? That might just be them pausing to gather their thoughts, not necessarily hiding something. I also noticed their arms are folded *and* open at the same time, which doesn't fit a clear pattern—maybe they shifted positions mid-sentence, which happens to everyone.  

The thing is, people who lie sometimes *do* mimic calm, direct behavior to seem trustworthy, so I can't rule that out entirely. But the lack of obvious stress signals—like shaky hands, awkward pauses, or avoiding the gaze—makes me lean toward them being honest. Still, I'm not 100% sure. If this were a real-life situation, I'd probably ask follow-up questions to be safe, but based on the video alone? I'd guess they're telling the truth, but it's not a slam dunk. It's the absence of the "lie signs" more than anything, and that's usually a stronger clue than a few ambiguous gestures. But yeah, I'd hesitate to say for sure—body language's messy like that.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person's being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. They're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's usually a good sign for truthfulness, since people who lie often avoid eye contact or seem distracted. But they're also glancing down a few times while they speak, which can be confusing. Sometimes people look down when they're thinking carefully or being humble, but others might do it to avoid being caught in a lie. I don't see any obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or a forced smile—those are things I'd expect if they were lying, so that leans toward them being calm and probably honest.  

The thing that stands out most is them covering their mouth with their hands a couple of times. I've heard that covering the mouth can be a sign of discomfort or trying to hold back words, which might hint at deception. But honestly, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking or maybe even a little embarrassed—like when they're about to say something they're not sure about, not necessarily lying. It could just be a nervous habit, especially since they're not doing it constantly or with exaggerated movements.  

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect them to be more on edge—maybe avoiding eye contact more, or showing other signs like fidgeting with their hands or shifting in their seat. But they're not doing any of that. They seem pretty steady, which makes me wonder if the mouth-covering is just a quirk. I guess it's possible they're a really good liar who's not giving off classic signals, but that feels less likely to me. Most people aren't that practiced at hiding their body language.  

All in all, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because of the consistent eye contact and lack of other red flags, but I can't be sure. The mouth covering is making me hesitate a bit—maybe it's a sign of something else entirely. Like, if they're just a quiet person or really focused on what they're saying, that could explain it. It's hard to say for certain without knowing the context of what they're talking about. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to feel confident.

Hmm, this is a tough one to call just from watching. I see the person sitting there, and they're definitely doing a few things that make me pause. Their eyebrows are raised pretty noticeably—like they're surprised or maybe skeptical about what's being said. And they keep tilting their head to the side while shaking it "no" a couple times, which feels a bit... off? Like, if they were just answering a question straightforwardly, I wouldn't expect that mix of tilting and shaking. Plus, they're leaning forward a bit with their arms wide open, which usually looks like someone trying to seem approachable or open, but it feels a little forced in this context.  

That said, I'm really not sure. I mean, raised eyebrows can just mean someone's genuinely taken aback by something—like if they heard a surprising fact. And head tilting? That's super common when people are thinking or trying to process info, not necessarily lying. The arm-open thing might just be their natural way of gesturing when they're engaged in conversation, especially if they're trying to be friendly. Maybe they're just nervous about being on camera, and that's why they're doing all these little movements. I've seen people fidget or tilt their heads when they're stressed, not just when they're hiding something.  

The head shaking makes me lean toward deception a tiny bit more—like they're dismissing something—but it could also be a genuine "no" to a question. Like, if someone asked "Did you do that?" and they shook their head, it wouldn't mean they're lying. It's just... ambiguous. And honestly, the video doesn't show any of the classic "tells" like avoiding eye contact (they're actually looking right at the person talking to them) or fidgeting with their hands. So it's not like there's a lot of clear evidence for lying here.  

I guess my gut says it's *possible* they're not being 100% truthful—especially with that combination of raised eyebrows and head tilting—but I'd feel really uncomfortable saying for sure. It could just be them being expressive or a bit flustered. I'd want to see more context, like what the actual question was, before I'd bet on it. For now? I'm leaning toward "not sure," but I wouldn't rule out deception entirely. It's one of those things where the behavior is weird enough to make you wonder, but not weird enough to prove anything.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person's behavior feels a bit... off, but I'm not ready to say they're definitely lying. Let me walk through what stands out to me.

First, they have this really noticeable raised eyebrow thing—like they're genuinely surprised or skeptical about something. And then there's that head shake, almost like a quick "no" while their head's still up. That feels a bit tense, like they're trying to dismiss something. Their lips are sort of pushed out, not smiling, just... there, which sometimes happens when people are holding back or trying to look neutral when they're nervous. And they're touching their head or neck a few times—like a little fidget, which I've noticed before can be a stress signal when someone's uncomfortable. The chin moving up too, like they're lifting it slightly, which feels defensive or maybe even a bit aggressive? And yeah, arms are wide open, which usually reads as "I'm being honest," but I've seen people do that on purpose to seem trustworthy when they're not.

But here's where I get confused: their head's up the whole time, not looking down or away, which is often a sign of confidence (or at least, not hiding). And the arms being open... that really clashes with the other signs. If they were lying, wouldn't they be more closed off? Like arms crossed or hands in their lap? The fact that they're not fidgeting with their hands in a way that screams "nervous" (no rubbing, no scratching) also makes me pause. Maybe they're just really calm under pressure, or maybe they're just naturally expressive—some people raise eyebrows a lot even when they're telling the truth.

I keep thinking about the head shake. It's not a big, exaggerated "no," just a subtle tilt. Could that be part of the conversation, like they're saying "no" to a question but it's not related to lying? Like, "No, I didn't do it" but actually telling the truth? Or maybe it's just a habit. And the lips protruding... it's not a smirk, so it's not fake happiness, but it's also not a frown. Just... neutral, but tense.

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The signs lean a little toward deception—raised eyebrows, head shake, chin movement, hands touching head—but the open arms and steady gaze make me doubt it. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's not a slam dunk. Maybe they're just really stressed about being filmed, or maybe they're actually telling the truth but are super tense about the situation. Without knowing what they were asked, it's hard to tell if the head shake is a denial or just a reaction. I'd need to hear the question or see more of the context to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward "maybe," but I wouldn't bet money on it. It feels like they're holding something back, but I'm not sure if it's deception or just someone who's not used to being on camera.

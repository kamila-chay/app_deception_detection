Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm and direct. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no looking away or darting eyes—and their arms are open, not crossed or folded, which usually feels more relaxed and less defensive. They also shrug a couple of times, which often comes off as "I don't know" or "it's just how it is," not something you'd do if you were trying to hide something. Those things together make it *feel* like they're being straightforward, at least on the surface.  

But honestly, it's tricky. I've heard that some people who lie actually practice looking calm and making eye contact to seem credible—they might even open their arms on purpose to look trustworthy. And shrugging? Sometimes liars shrug to seem casual when they're nervous underneath. Plus, the video doesn't show much else—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, but that could just mean they're good at staying still, not that they're telling the truth. Like, a really practiced liar might avoid all the obvious tells.  

I guess the strongest thing for truth is that they don't seem *stressed*—no signs of tension in their face or body. But stress can be faked too, so it's not a guarantee. If I had to guess based on this clip alone, it leans toward them being truthful, but I'd want more context—like what they're actually saying or if there's a history of deception. It's not 100% clear, but the lack of classic "lying" cues makes me think they're probably not lying here. Still, I'd hesitate to say for sure without hearing the words they're saying.

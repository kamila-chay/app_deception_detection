Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being honest or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "liar" or "truth-teller" outright—it's more subtle. They're not avoiding eye contact completely, but their gaze is mostly down and sideways, which makes me wonder if they're uncomfortable or just thinking. I've seen people look away when they're being truthful and trying to recall details, so that alone doesn't tip me toward lying.  

What stands out is the frowning eyebrows and lips retracted (like they're pulling their mouth tight), which feels like they're stressed or frustrated. But then there's a slight lip corner up—almost like a weak smile—and they're nodding while also shaking their head. That combination is confusing. Head shaking usually means "no," but they're nodding (which is "yes"), so it might just be a nervous habit or them processing something internally, not necessarily lying. I've noticed people do that when they're trying to say something carefully, like when they're being honest but hesitant.  

The exaggerated eye closing is another one—I've seen that in people who are trying to remember something, not just liars. Truth-tellers might do that when they're thinking hard, and the lack of frequent blinking or hand movements (like rubbing hands) makes me think they're not overly anxious. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely, but here it's more about subtle tension.  

On the flip side, the gaze down and sideways could be a red flag for some people—they might interpret that as hiding something. And the lips retracted with frowning might feel like they're trying too hard to seem neutral. But honestly, I've seen truth-tellers get tense in interviews or when they're upset, so it doesn't *have* to mean deception. The head tilting and moving backward also seem like natural gestures, not signs of guilt.  

I guess I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because the behaviors feel more like internal stress than deliberate lying. But I'm not 100% sure—people are complicated, and context matters. If this were a high-stakes situation, I'd want more to go on, but based on what's here, the lack of classic "lie" cues (like excessive blinking or avoiding the question) makes me think they're being genuine. Still, it's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're talking about. Maybe they're just having a rough moment.

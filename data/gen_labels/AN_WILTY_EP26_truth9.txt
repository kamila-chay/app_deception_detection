Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky without knowing the context of what they're saying. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor—and they're not avoiding eye contact, which usually feels like a good sign for truthfulness. I also don't see any of the classic "nervous" tells like fidgeting, covering their mouth, or excessive blinking, which makes me lean toward them being honest. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which might just be them reacting to something they're hearing or saying—like they're surprised or emphasizing a point—not necessarily a sign of lying. And the head shaking? That's the one thing that throws me a little. It could be them disagreeing with something, but it's not like a frantic "no" shake; it's just a subtle nod, so it might just be part of their natural gestures while talking.  

That said, I can see why someone might second-guess it. Head shaking *can* sometimes signal defensiveness or even deception in some contexts, like if they're denying something while shaking their head. But here, they're not shaking it aggressively or repeatedly—it's just a single, calm motion. And since they're maintaining eye contact and not showing any other stress cues (like lip biting or awkward pauses), it feels more like they're just being expressive rather than hiding something. Truth-tellers often look people in the eye and don't seem overly anxious, so this seems to fit. But I'm not 100% sure—I mean, people lie in all sorts of ways, and without knowing what they're being asked about, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their head and eyebrows. I'd probably guess they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the full conversation to feel more confident. It just doesn't *feel* like the behavior of someone who's trying to cover up something.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but after watching it a few times, I'm leaning toward them possibly not being completely truthful. They have this slight upturn in their lip corners—like a very subtle smile—and they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which feels a bit off because when people are genuinely relaxed or honest, they often glance away naturally. The palms-up gesture and the shrug also stand out; I've heard some experts say those can be used to seem open or innocent, but I've also seen them in moments where someone's trying too hard to appear calm while lying. Like, if they were just being friendly or unsure, they might not do the shrug *and* the slight smile at the same time—it feels a bit staged.

On the flip side, though, it's totally possible they're just being polite or nervous about the question, not deceptive. The eye contact could mean they're trying to connect, and the shrug might just be a natural "I don't know" gesture. I've seen people do palms-up and lip corners up when they're being completely honest, especially in casual chats. Plus, the video doesn't show any obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which makes me wonder if I'm overthinking it. Maybe they're just a little awkward, and the smile is just their default when they're thinking. 

I guess it's a toss-up—I wouldn't bet on it, but the combination of the forced smile and the calculated gestures makes me lean toward deception. Still, I can't rule out that they're just being themselves, so I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those things where context would help a lot, but based on what I see, I'd say maybe.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always clear-cut. What stands out to me is how they're moving their head a lot—like tilting it sideways and turning it away from the camera, plus pulling their head back slightly like they're creating space. And their gaze is consistently down, not meeting the person they're talking to. I've read that people who might be hiding something often avoid eye contact or look away, so that makes me lean toward deception a little. The chin moving up too—like they're trying to hold themselves stiffly—sometimes feels like a defensive posture when someone's not being honest.

But I'm not sure. It could totally be innocent. Maybe they're just really shy or naturally expressive with their head—some people tilt their head when they're listening carefully, and the gaze down might just be cultural or a nervous habit, not deception. I also notice they're not fidgeting or doing anything obvious like covering their mouth, which some people think is a "lying" sign, but I know that's not reliable. They seem calm otherwise, no fake smiles or weird blinking. So maybe they're just uncomfortable in the situation, not lying. 

The head movements combined with the downward gaze feel a bit off to me, but I can't rule out other reasons. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's *possible* they're not being truthful, but I wouldn't bet on it. There are too many ways that behavior could be explained without deception. I'd want to see more context or hear what they're actually saying before I'd feel confident about it. For now, I'm leaning toward "maybe," but it's really close to neutral.

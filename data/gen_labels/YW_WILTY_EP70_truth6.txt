Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out as I watch the clip, and I'm not 100% sure, but here's how it's playing for me. The person seems pretty calm—no fidgeting, no obvious signs of stress like quick blinking or covering their mouth. They're looking right at the camera (or whoever they're talking to), which feels engaged, and they're nodding along while speaking. That steady eye contact and nodding usually makes me lean toward truth, like they're genuinely connecting with what they're saying. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which I've heard can sometimes signal surprise or processing, but not necessarily lying—maybe they're just thinking through their answer. 

But here's where I hesitate: raised eyebrows can also be a nervous tic for some people, and I know some liars are really good at keeping their composure. If they were lying, they might be trying *too* hard to seem relaxed, so the lack of obvious stress could actually be suspicious. Also, I've read that upward gaze (which they have) is sometimes linked to lying in *some* studies, though other times it's tied to memory recall—which would support truth. It's confusing because context matters so much. Like, if they're describing something factual, looking up might just be them remembering details, but if they're making something up, maybe it's the same gesture. 

What really stands out is how *smooth* their delivery is—no awkward pauses, no lip movements like biting or tightening. If they were lying, I'd expect more micro-signs of tension, even if they're trying to hide it. But then again, I've seen people lie without any visible tells, especially if they're practiced. Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think they're being truthful. The absence of classic deception cues (like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting) feels stronger than the raised eyebrows or upward gaze. But I'm not ruling out the possibility they're a good liar—I just don't see the evidence for it here. So yeah, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd still want to hear the full context to be sure. It's not a slam dunk, but it feels more like they're being honest than not.

Looking at the clip, I’m trying to figure out if they’re being truthful or not, but it’s honestly a bit of a toss-up. They’re not doing anything super obvious like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely—they’re actually looking at the person they’re talking to, which feels like they’re trying to be engaged. But then they keep looking down a lot, and their eyebrows are raised a few times, which I’ve noticed people do when they’re either surprised or trying to think of a story. The open arms and leaning in a bit feel like they’re being friendly or honest, which usually makes me lean toward truth, but I’ve also heard that people who lie sometimes force themselves to look “too” engaged to seem trustworthy. 

On the other hand, the lack of nervous habits like blinking a lot or touching their face is kind of odd for a liar—usually, they’d be more fidgety. Maybe they’re really good at controlling themselves, or maybe they’re just calm by nature. The raised eyebrows could just be a reaction to the question, not anything deceptive. Honestly, I’d probably be more convinced they’re lying if they’d been avoiding eye contact entirely, but since they’re still making some eye contact while looking down, it’s hard to say. It feels like they might be trying to seem genuine, but the downcast gaze is nagging at me. I’m not 100% sure, but I’d lean toward them being truthful because of the open posture and lack of obvious tells, though I can see how someone else might think the gaze down is a red flag. It’s one of those situations where without more context, it’s really tough to call.

Watching the clip, I’m inclined to think they might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. They maintain eye contact, which normally suggests engagement and honesty, but the frequent downward glances and raised eyebrows strike me as signs that they could be fabricating or carefully constructing their response. Those raised eyebrows often indicate surprise or someone trying to come up with a story, which raises some suspicion here. Their open arms and leaning in might be an attempt to appear friendly and trustworthy, yet I’ve heard that people who lie sometimes overcompensate by acting overly engaged to mask their deception.

What’s curious is the absence of typical nervous behaviors like excessive blinking or face-touching, which might suggest they’re either very composed liars or naturally calm. Still, the combination of subtle discomfort in their gaze and those expressions that could signal cognitive effort makes me lean toward the idea that they’re not being entirely truthful. While they don’t avoid eye contact completely, the pattern of looking down intermittently feels like a bit of a red flag. Overall, I can’t be certain, but I’m slightly more inclined to suspect deception given these cues, even though their body language has some elements that could be interpreted otherwise. Without more context, it’s hard to say definitively, but my impression leans toward them possibly not being honest.

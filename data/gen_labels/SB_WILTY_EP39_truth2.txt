Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up for me. On one hand, they've got this really open posture—palms up, arms wide open, and they're actually making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That usually feels like someone being genuine, like they're not hiding anything. Plus, their hands aren't doing anything fidgety like rubbing or covering their face, which sometimes happens when people are nervous about lying.  

But then there are some things that make me pause. They're blinking a lot—like, really frequently—and their eyebrows are raised a lot too. I've heard people say raised eyebrows can signal uncertainty, and frequent blinking sometimes means someone's stressed or trying to avoid eye contact, though here they *are* making eye contact. They also keep looking down a lot, which I've read can sometimes be linked to deception, but honestly, I've seen people look down when they're just thinking hard or feeling shy, not necessarily lying. And their chin is moving up and down a bit, like they're hesitating—maybe they're just struggling to find the right words.  

I keep going back to the open body language though. When someone's palms are up and arms are open like that, it feels like they're inviting trust, not hiding. The head movements (forward, backward, side-turn) seem more like natural gestures of engagement than signs of deception. I wonder if the blinking and raised eyebrows are just their normal way of speaking, not nervousness. Like, maybe they're just a very expressive person, and the topic is just making them a bit flustered.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, those nervous cues might be real, but the open posture would be weird for someone trying to hide something. Most people who lie tend to close off their body language—crossing arms, avoiding eye contact, covering their mouth. Here, everything's the opposite. I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to overread small cues, and without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's hard to say. Maybe they're just really anxious about the situation, not lying. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to hear the whole conversation before I'd feel confident about it.

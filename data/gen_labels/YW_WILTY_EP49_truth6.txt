Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because it's really hard to tell just from the video alone. The person is smiling—lip corners up, not a huge grin but a subtle one—and they're keeping eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels more natural when someone's being genuine. They're also looking down a bit while talking, which I've heard can mean they're thinking carefully or being humble, not necessarily hiding something. But then there's that head moving backward thing—like they're pulling away slightly from the person they're talking to. That part makes me pause because sometimes when people are uncomfortable or lying, they'll lean back like that to create distance. 

On the other hand, there's no frowning, no nervous blinking, no hands fidgeting or covering their mouth—those are the classic "lie signs" I've seen in other videos, and they're completely absent here. If they were making it up, I'd expect *some* sign of stress, even if they're trying to hide it. The calmness of the rest of their behavior actually feels more like someone who's confident in what they're saying. Maybe the head movement isn't even about lying—it could just be a natural habit, like how some people lean back when they're listening or thinking. 

I guess the biggest thing keeping me from being sure is that absence of stress cues is strong evidence for truth, but it's not foolproof. Some people are really good at lying without showing any physical signs, and others might just be naturally calm. Without knowing what they're being asked about, it's hard to tell if the context would make this behavior suspicious. Like, if they were denying something obvious, the head movement might stand out more. But based on what I'm seeing, the smile and steady gaze feel more like truth-telling than deception. I'd lean toward truth, but I'm not 100% certain—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

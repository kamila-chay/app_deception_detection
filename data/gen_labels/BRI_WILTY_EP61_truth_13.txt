Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but after watching the clip a few times, my gut leans toward them telling the truth. The thing that sticks out is how completely still they are—no fidgeting, no shifting, no micro-expressions like raised eyebrows or tense lips. They’re just... calm. Like they’re not even trying to hide anything. I know people often expect liars to look nervous—staring at the floor, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting—but here, they’re just sitting there, maybe even a little neutral. It feels like the opposite of what I’d expect from someone lying.  

But then I think, "Wait, maybe they’re a really good liar?" Like, they’ve practiced so much they’ve mastered not showing any signs at all. I’ve heard of people who can stay completely composed under pressure, so it’s possible they’re hiding it well. The absence of all those tells could just mean they’re skilled, not necessarily truthful.  

Still, the fact that *nothing* stands out—no awkward pauses, no forced smiles, no eye movements—makes me lean the other way. Most truth-tellers I’ve seen in videos (like in interviews or testimony) actually *do* seem relaxed when they’re being honest, especially if they’re not stressed about the situation. If they were lying, I’d expect *some* small sign, even if it’s subtle—like a quick blink or a slight shift in posture. But here, it’s all just... quiet. Like they’re not even thinking about it.  

I guess I’m torn because it’s hard to prove either way without context. But based on what I *saw*—no nervous energy, no obvious tension—I’d say it feels more like truth. It’s not that I’m certain, though. It’s just that the calmness feels authentic, not rehearsed. Like they’re just answering a straightforward question without overthinking it. If they were lying, I’d expect more effort to seem natural, but here it just looks effortless. So yeah, I’m leaning toward truth, but I’d need more to be sure.

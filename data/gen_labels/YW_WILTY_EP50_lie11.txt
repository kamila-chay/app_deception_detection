Looking at the clip, I’m trying to figure out if they’re being truthful here. Honestly, it’s a bit tricky because the cues don’t all line up neatly. On one hand, they’re blinking a lot—like, really frequently—and their lips are pulled up at the corners, almost like a slight, forced smile. That *does* make me lean toward deception a bit, because I’ve heard that people often blink more when they’re stressed or lying, and that lip movement feels a little off—like it’s not quite matching the rest of their expression. They’re also nodding while they talk, which could be natural, but sometimes that’s a way to seem more convincing when you’re trying to cover something up.

But then there’s the other side: their palms are up, open and visible, and they’re keeping steady eye contact with whoever they’re speaking to. I’ve read that open palms and direct gaze are usually signs of honesty, right? Like, if someone’s lying, they might fidget or look away, but here they seem pretty composed in that way. The nodding might just be a natural part of speaking, not necessarily deceptive. And honestly, people blink a lot for reasons other than lying—maybe they’re just tired, or the lighting’s bothering their eyes. The lip thing could even be a nervous habit, not a fake smile. 

I guess what’s throwing me off is that the open palms and eye contact feel so *opposite* of what I’d expect from someone lying. If they were trying to deceive, I’d expect them to avoid eye contact or have more fidgety gestures, but they’re not doing that. Still, the frequent blinking and that subtle lip movement… I can’t shake the feeling it might be a stress reaction. Maybe they’re just really nervous about the situation, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they’re scared of getting caught in something minor, not deliberately deceiving. 

At the end of the day, I’d say it’s *possible* they’re lying, but I’m not sure. It’s easy to overread body language, and without knowing the context—like what they’re even talking about—it’s hard to tell. The open gestures make me doubt it, but the blinking and lip thing make me wonder. I’d probably say "maybe," but I wouldn’t bet on it. It’s one of those clips where you just can’t be 100% sure without more to go on.

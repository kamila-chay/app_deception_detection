Honestly, this one's a bit tricky to call for sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, though I can see why someone might second-guess it. The person isn't doing any of those obvious "lie signs" we often hear about—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting with their hands, or giving that stiff, fake smile. Instead, they're actually making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor), which usually suggests openness. They're also looking down occasionally, which I'd interpret as thoughtful or reflective, not guilty—like they're really thinking about what they're saying. And that head tilting to the side? Feels natural, like they're engaged in the conversation, not trying to hide something.

But here's where it gets messy: their eyebrows are raised the whole time, which can sometimes mean surprise or skepticism, not necessarily deception. I've seen people raise their brows when they're trying to seem calm while lying, so that *could* be a red flag. And the chin moving up a bit—like they're lifting it slightly—might read as defensive to some, though I don't think it's a strong indicator. The thing that really stands out to me is how calm they seem otherwise. No frantic blinking, no lip biting, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like fiddling with their shirt or shifting in their seat. Here, they're just sitting there, talking plainly, with that sideways head tilt like they're nodding along with the conversation.

On the other hand, maybe I'm just biased because I've heard people say raised eyebrows can be a sign of deception. Or maybe the downcast gaze is making me think they're avoiding something, even though I know that's not always the case—it could just mean they're concentrating. But honestly, the lack of *any* physical tells that scream "lying" (like crossed arms or covering their mouth) makes me think they're probably being honest. It just feels... relaxed, in a way that doesn't match how I picture someone rehearsing a lie. Like, if they were making it up, they'd probably be overcompensating with more gestures. This feels like someone just answering a straightforward question without a lot of extra baggage. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but I'm not 100% certain—there's always room for misreading body language, especially if the context is missing. It's just that the video doesn't give me any real reason to doubt them.

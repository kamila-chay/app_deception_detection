Watching the clip, the person seems really still—no fidgeting, no obvious nervous tics, not even blinking much. They’re just sitting there, quiet and composed, not smiling or frowning, and they don’t really seem to be making eye contact with whoever they’re talking to. At first glance, that calmness makes me lean toward them telling the truth because most people think liars would be twitchy or avoid eye contact, but... well, I’ve heard some really good liars don’t show any of that. Like, they might be practiced enough to stay completely still. But then again, the fact that they’re not looking at the person could be a red flag—some people avoid eye contact when lying, though others just don’t like direct stares for personal reasons. Honestly, it’s tricky. If they were lying, I’d expect them to at least seem a bit tense, but they’re not. It’s almost too calm, which makes me wonder if they’re just really good at hiding it. But the more I watch, the less I see any signs that scream "deception," so I’m kinda stuck between "they’re probably truthful" and "maybe they’re just hiding it well." I’d say it’s leaning truth, but I can’t be sure—like, what if they’re just naturally chill? It’s hard to say without knowing their baseline behavior.

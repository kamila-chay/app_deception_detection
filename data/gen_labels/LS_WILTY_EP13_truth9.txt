Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're making eye contact with the person they're talking to (which is actually a bit counter to the old myth that liars avoid eye contact), and their head is moving around naturally—tilting, turning sideways, nodding a bit with the head, like they're really engaged in the conversation. Their chin is moving up and down a lot, which could feel a bit nervous to some people, but it also looks like they're just gesturing while speaking, like when you're emphasizing a point. The lips are pulled down a bit and pushed out a little, which might look like they're frustrated or annoyed at first glance, but I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating or being serious, not necessarily lying. 

What stands out to me is how *not* nervous they seem. No fidgeting with their hands, no covering their mouth, no weird blinking or squinting—they're just... talking. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, but here they're consistently looking at the person and moving their head like they're comfortable. The gaze up and sideways feels natural too, like they're thinking or recalling something, not hiding. 

But I can see why someone might doubt it. That lip thing—corners down and protruded—could read as negative, like they're holding back or being dismissive. And the chin movements might seem shaky to someone who's really looking for "tells." If I didn't know better, I might think, "Hmm, maybe they're not happy with what they're saying?" But then I remember that people have natural expressions, and those lip movements don't match the classic "lie signs" I've read about. Like, liars often have micro-expressions of fear or guilt, but here it's just a consistent, neutral-ish face. 

Honestly, I'd lean toward them telling the truth because the behavior feels *engaged* rather than *guarded*. The lack of stress cues (no hands on face, no rapid blinking) is really the strongest thing for me. But I'm not 100% sure—human behavior is messy, and maybe they're just really good at hiding it. Still, based on what I see, it doesn't *feel* like lying. It feels like someone who's just being honest and maybe a little thoughtful, not someone trying to pull a fast one. If I had to guess without any other context, I'd say truth, but I'd still wonder if there's more to the situation.

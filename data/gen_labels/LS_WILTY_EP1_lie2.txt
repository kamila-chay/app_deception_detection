Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's tricky because people act differently under stress. What stands out to me is how their face keeps shifting—like they're smiling one second and then scowling the next, with their lips pulling up and down in quick succession. That kind of mixed expression doesn't feel natural to me; when people are genuinely happy or upset, their faces usually stay consistent. They also keep raising their eyebrows and tilting their head a lot, which feels a bit too deliberate, like they're trying to seem engaged or sincere. And their chin juts up a few times—almost like they're tensing their jaw while talking, which I've noticed before when people are holding back something.

But I'm not totally sure. Maybe they're just really expressive or nervous about the situation, not necessarily lying. The arms being open could actually signal honesty, and the way they look around (up, down, sideways) might just be how they think when they're speaking. Some people do that when they're recalling details, which is truthful. I've seen people with anxiety do similar things without lying. Still, the way their expressions contradict each other—smiling while scowling—makes me lean toward deception. It's not 100% clear, but I'd say it's more likely they're not being fully truthful than the alternative. I'd want to see more context though, because it's easy to misread someone's behavior.

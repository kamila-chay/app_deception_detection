Looking at the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. The behavior feels a bit off, but it's hard to say for sure. The most noticeable thing is how often they're blinking—way more than normal, like they're trying not to make eye contact or just really nervous. And those exaggerated eye openings? Like they're staring really wide-eyed, which sometimes happens when people are trying too hard to seem sincere. Their chin is moving up and down a lot too, almost like they're nodding without realizing it, and their head keeps tilting sideways while they talk. That feels a bit forced, like they're overcompensating for something.

But then there's the opposite stuff that makes me doubt it's deception. Their arms are wide open the whole time—no crossing, no folding—which usually suggests openness, not hiding something. And they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, which is the opposite of what I'd expect if they were lying (since liars often avoid eye contact). The head moving forward and backward together also seems more like natural nervous energy than a calculated lie. Maybe they're just really anxious about the conversation, not trying to deceive.

I'm leaning toward them being nervous rather than lying, but I'm not confident. Sometimes people blink a lot or move their chin when they're just tired or stressed, not because they're hiding something. The open arms and direct gaze really counter the "deception" label I've heard mentioned, which makes me wonder if the video might be edited or if the context is off—like maybe they're in a high-pressure situation where anyone would seem tense. But then again, the exaggerated eye stuff is weirdly specific for just being nervous. Honestly, it's a toss-up. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably not lying, but I'd feel way more sure if they weren't blinking so much. It's really hard to tell from just this clip alone.

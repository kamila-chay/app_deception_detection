Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky. They're sitting with their arms crossed and shrugging a bit, which I've noticed people do when they're being honest but maybe a little unsure or just in a relaxed posture. They're also looking directly at whoever's talking to them, not avoiding eye contact, and their eyebrows are raised a couple times, which might just be them processing what they're saying or showing mild surprise, not necessarily deception. The fact that they're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, and not making weird facial expressions like scowling or forced smiles feels... normal? Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more nervous ticks, but this seems pretty calm.  

But then again, I know some people lie while staying calm and making eye contact—like if they're practiced or really confident in their story. The raised eyebrows and the slight head tilt (wait, no, the label says no head tilting, but they're looking up sometimes) might actually be a red flag for some people, since liars sometimes look up when they're making things up. And arms crossed could be defensive, which *might* hint at discomfort, but honestly, a lot of people just cross their arms when they're thinking or just feel comfortable doing it. I've seen so many videos where people do that while being totally truthful.  

The shrug especially feels like it's just part of the conversation—not like they're shrugging to avoid answering. It seems like they're genuinely saying, "I don't know" or "That's just how it was," which isn't inherently suspicious. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in their voice or maybe a pause where they're scrambling for words, but they're speaking smoothly.  

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because there's no clear "lie" behavior here—just neutral or even positive signs like steady eye contact. But I can't rule out that the crossed arms or raised brows might mean something else. It's not like they're sweating or avoiding gaze, which I'd expect if they were making it up. Still, I'm not going to claim I *know*—it's just what seems to fit best from what I'm watching. Maybe they're just the type of person who crosses their arms when they talk.

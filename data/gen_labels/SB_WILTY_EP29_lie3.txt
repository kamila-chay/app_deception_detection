Honestly, after watching the clip a few times, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful. The way they kept blinking so frequently—like, way more than normal when someone's just talking—made me notice right away. And their eyebrows were constantly raised *and* furrowed at the same time, which feels off. Like, they're trying to look engaged but also tense. I also noticed their chin kept jutting up a bit, almost like they're bracing themselves, and their head kept moving backward while tilting sideways. It’s not like they were avoiding eye contact entirely—they were looking at the person they were talking to—but their eyes kept darting up, down, and sideways like they were searching for something. That kind of shifting gaze often happens when someone’s constructing a story.

But here’s why I’m not totally convinced: they weren’t smiling or laughing, which some people think liars do to seem friendly. Actually, the absence of that *might* mean they’re genuinely uncomfortable, not lying. Maybe they’re just nervous about being on camera, or they’re naturally expressive with their eyebrows and head movements. I’ve seen people do similar things when they’re just stressed about a conversation, not necessarily hiding something. And the chin movement—while it can signal defensiveness—could just be a habit, like how some people tap their chin when thinking. It’s hard to tell if it’s a lie or just them being a little flustered.

I guess the biggest thing that sticks with me is the blinking and the gaze shifts. Those feel more consistent with deception than the other cues. But I’d be hesitant to say "definitely lying" because people get nervous for all sorts of reasons, and this could just be them being awkward. If I had to guess based on what I saw, I’d say it’s probably deception, but I’d want to see more context—like what they were even talking about—to feel confident. It’s one of those cases where the behavior *suggests* something, but it’s not impossible it’s just anxiety. I’d say 60-70% chance they’re not being fully honest, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.

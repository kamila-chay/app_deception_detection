After watching the clip several times, I’m inclined to think they might not be telling the whole truth. Their blinking was noticeably more frequent than usual, which immediately caught my attention. The constant combination of raised and furrowed eyebrows seemed unusual as well—almost like they were trying to appear engaged while simultaneously feeling tense. Their chin jutted upward slightly, as if bracing themselves, and their head movements—tilting sideways while moving backward—felt a bit defensive. Although they maintained eye contact with the person they were speaking to, their eyes frequently darted in various directions, which is often a sign of someone fabricating a story.

That said, I’m not entirely certain they’re lying. They didn’t smile or laugh to mask their deception, which some might expect, so maybe they’re just genuinely uncomfortable or nervous on camera. People can display similar facial expressions and movements simply due to stress or habit. The chin movement could be nothing more than a thinking gesture rather than a sign of defensiveness. It’s difficult to determine if these behaviors point to dishonesty or just nervousness.

Still, the combination of rapid blinking and shifty gaze leans more toward deception in my mind. While I hesitate to say they’re definitely lying—since anxiety and awkwardness can produce similar cues—I would lean towards believing there’s a good chance they’re not fully truthful. Without more information on the context or topic of conversation, I’d cautiously estimate there’s about a 60-70% likelihood that they're being deceptive, but it’s not something I’d be entirely sure about.

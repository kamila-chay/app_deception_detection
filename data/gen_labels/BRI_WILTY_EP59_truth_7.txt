Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it seems like they're probably telling the truth. The most noticeable thing is how they're looking at the person they're talking to—like, they keep making direct eye contact most of the time, which usually feels more natural when someone's being genuine. But they also glance sideways a few times, which I guess could be a red flag for some people. Like, sometimes liars look away or glance around nervously, but here it feels... casual? Almost like they're just thinking while they talk, not hiding anything. 

I mean, I'd expect more signs if they were lying—like fidgeting with their hands, avoiding eye contact completely, or even looking up like they're searching for a story. But they're not doing any of that. Their face is pretty neutral too—no fake smiles, no frowns, no weird mouth movements. And they're speaking without awkward pauses, which feels like they're just being straightforward. 

That said, I can see why someone might second-guess it. Sideways glances *can* sometimes indicate deception, like if they're trying to avoid being caught. But in this case, it's not constant—they're mostly looking at the person, and the sideways looks seem brief, almost like normal conversation where you glance away while thinking. Plus, there's no other nervous behavior to back up the "lying" idea. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little more tension in their posture or facial expressions. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context, but based on the video alone, the lack of classic "lie" cues—combined with the steady eye contact—makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I'm not ruling out the sideways glances entirely; it's just that the rest of their behavior doesn't match the "deceptive" pattern. You know, it feels more like someone who's just a little thoughtful than someone trying to hide something.

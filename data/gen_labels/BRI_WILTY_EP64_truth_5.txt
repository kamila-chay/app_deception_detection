Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, it feels like they're probably telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how they're not doing any of the usual "tells" people often associate with lying—no frowning, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed, no nervous hand movements like rubbing their face or crossing fingers. Instead, they're raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes really wide, which actually seems like they're trying to emphasize something, maybe to show they're being genuine or just really engaged in what they're saying. I've noticed sometimes when people are being honest and trying to make a point, they do that—like they're literally "opening up" to be clear.

But here's where I hesitate: could that exaggerated eye opening be a way to *fake* sincerity? Like, maybe they know people think wide eyes mean truth, so they're overdoing it? And the raised eyebrows... that could also be confusion or surprise, not necessarily truth. I mean, I've seen people lie while looking completely calm and even smiling, so the absence of "bad" signs doesn't *prove* they're truthful—it just makes it less likely. It's also possible they're just naturally expressive, like someone who uses big gestures when they talk, whether they're lying or not. I don't see them avoiding eye contact either, which is another common lie sign, but some people just don't look away when they're lying, especially if they're practiced.

Honestly, I'm leaning toward truth because the behavior doesn't match the classic "lying" checklist, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at hiding it. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably being honest, but it's not 100% clear-cut. It's easy to misread these things—like, what if they're just excited about the topic, not lying? I'd feel more confident if they'd said something specific, but based on the body language alone, it just doesn't scream "deception" to me. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd be sure.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person's being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there's no clear "tell" like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which makes me lean toward them being genuine, but I'm not totally sure. They kept their gaze locked on the person they were talking to—no shifting eyes or looking away—and their palms were up, which usually feels open and honest to me, like they're not hiding anything. Their eyebrows were raised a bit when they spoke, which I've seen before when someone's genuinely surprised or trying to emphasize a point, not when they're making something up. And they didn't smile or laugh unnaturally, which often happens when people are nervous about lying.  

But then again, I've also noticed that sometimes people *do* look down when they're lying to avoid being caught—like they're thinking of a story. And raised eyebrows could just mean they're confused by the question, not necessarily that they're being truthful. The palms up thing is a bit of a toss-up too; some people do that to seem sincere even when they're not. Like, it's a gesture people learn to use when they want to appear trustworthy, so it might not mean much on its own.  

I guess the thing that sticks with me is how steady they seemed—no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no hands covering their face. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little nervous habits. But yeah, I know people can be really good at faking calmness too. So I'm not going to say for sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're telling the truth than not. Like, the absence of obvious signs of deception weighs heavier than the few things that could be ambiguous. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they said to be 100% sure—sometimes the context changes everything.

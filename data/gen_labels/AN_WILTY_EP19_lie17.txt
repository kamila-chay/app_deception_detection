Looking at the video, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them being truthful—though honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're holding steady eye contact the whole time, which feels intentional and engaged, not like someone avoiding your gaze because they're hiding something. And their arms are wide open the whole clip, which usually reads as open, non-defensive, even friendly. I've seen a lot of videos where liars cross their arms or fidget, so this feels... relaxed? Like they're not trying to close themselves off.

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes really practiced liars *do* mimic that calm, open behavior to seem honest. Maybe they've rehearsed this part or they're just naturally chill. I mean, the video's short, so I don't see any shifts in their tone or body when the question gets specific—no sudden stiffness or forced smiles. The description says no frowning or awkward pauses, which also leans truth, but... I wonder if the clip just happened to catch them at a calm moment. Like, maybe they *were* lying earlier, but this part was the "easy" part they'd prepared for.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, it's weird how smooth it seems—no signs of nervous energy. Most people I've seen lie in videos get a little twitchy, even if they're trying to hide it. But this feels too consistent. Their gaze stays locked on the person asking, like they're genuinely listening, not scanning for escape. I'd probably trust them more if I saw a tiny hesitation or a slight shift in posture, but there's nothing like that here. 

Still, I can't rule out deception entirely. Maybe they're just really good at it, or maybe the question was so straightforward they didn't need to lie. Honestly, I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd feel confident either way. But based on what I'm seeing—steady eyes, open arms, no fidgeting—I'm leaning toward truth, just because the cues I *do* see don't match the classic "lying" signals I've learned to watch for. It feels... honest, even if I can't prove it.

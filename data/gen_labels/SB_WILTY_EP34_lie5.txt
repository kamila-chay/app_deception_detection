Watching this clip, I'm kind of torn on whether they're being truthful or not. At first glance, there's a lot of stuff that makes me lean toward deception—like how their eyebrows are constantly raised and furrowed at the same time, which feels tense, and they're blinking way more than usual. Their eyes keep darting sideways instead of staying steady, and they lean back slightly while talking, almost like they're creating distance. That combination—nervous micro-expressions, shifting gaze, and that little head tilt—usually makes me think someone's trying to cover something up. It's not the classic "avoids eye contact" thing, but the sideways glances and that stiff posture feel off, like they're rehearsing or overthinking their answers.

But then I keep second-guessing myself because it could totally be something else. Maybe they're just naturally expressive—some people frown and raise their brows when they're concentrating, not lying. The blinking might be from dry eyes or just being in a bright room, not deception. And honestly, they're still looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels a bit contradictory if they were hiding something. I've seen people who lie maintain eye contact to seem credible, so that direct gaze could actually be a red herring. Plus, they're not doing obvious "tells" like covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands, which makes me wonder if I'm overreading it.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The cues I'm noticing are common in stress, which could come from lying—but it could also come from being anxious about the situation, like if they're being interviewed or just had a bad day. I wouldn't bet the farm on it, but if I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward deception. Still, I'd want to see more context before I'd feel confident about it. It's one of those cases where the behavior feels *off*, but not enough to rule out other explanations.

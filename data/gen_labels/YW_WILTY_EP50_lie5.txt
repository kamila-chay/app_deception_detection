Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them being truthful—not because they're perfect, but because the things they *aren't* doing seem to line up more with honesty. Like, they're holding steady eye contact the whole time, which usually feels more natural for someone being direct. And that head tilt? It doesn't look forced or nervous—it’s kind of like when you're listening carefully, nodding along in your head, but without moving your whole body. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no trying to cover their mouth or scratch their neck. Those are the little tells I've heard people use to spot lies, so the fact they're *missing* those makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying.  

But yeah, I could be wrong. I've read that some people fake eye contact when lying, or maybe they're just really practiced at it. And that head tilt... I've heard some folks say it can sometimes mean someone's trying to seem innocent or thoughtful while lying. Like, they're crafting a story, so they tilt their head like they're "solving" something. So I'm not ruling that out entirely. It's just that the *absence* of other signs—no blinking, no shifting gaze, no tense shoulders—makes the truthfulness feel more likely. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* of those nervous habits, even if they're trying to hide them.  

Honestly, it's tricky. But if I had to guess based on what's actually happening in the clip, I'd say they're probably telling the truth. Not because it's obvious, but because the behavior feels... calm. Like they're just talking about something ordinary, not rehearsing or hiding anything. Still, I'd want to see more context—what they're even talking about—to be sure. But based on the video alone? Yeah, I'm leaning toward truthful.

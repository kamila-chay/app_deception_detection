Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not, but I'll try to break it down as best I can. So, the person seems to be looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels like a good sign for honesty—people often avoid eye contact when they're not being truthful, but here they're holding it. Their eyebrows are raised *and* furrowed at the same time, which is kind of confusing. Usually, raised eyebrows alone might signal surprise or openness (like they're being genuine), but the frowning part makes me wonder if they're trying to process something tricky or maybe feeling a bit stressed about the question. 

Then there's the chin moving up—like a little lift, almost like they're holding their head up a bit higher—and the head moving backward a bit, which can sometimes look like someone trying to create space or mentally step back to think. But they're also turning their head slightly sideways while still keeping eye contact, which feels more like they're actively listening or thinking, not necessarily hiding something. Honestly, the head movements alone could go either way: it might be nervous energy, or it might just be how they naturally process things when answering. 

The thing that stands out most to me is that they're not doing any classic "lie signs" like covering their mouth, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting with their hands. They seem pretty still otherwise, which actually makes me lean toward them being truthful—because liars often have more physical tells. But then I keep thinking, maybe the frown and the chin lift are signs they're *trying* too hard to seem calm or composed? Like, if they were lying, they might force themselves to look confident, which could explain the chin lift and the slightly tense eyebrows. 

On the flip side, though, if they were being completely honest and just genuinely confused or thoughtful about the question, the frown and the raised eyebrows could just be them genuinely trying to recall or figure out the answer. The head turning sideways while staying in eye contact feels like someone who's engaged, not someone dodging. I guess the biggest counterargument for them lying is that they're not doing anything *obviously* deceptive—no blinking a lot, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. It just feels... like someone who's thinking hard, which happens when people are telling the truth too. 

Honestly, I'm stuck between "they're being truthful but a bit stressed about answering" and "they're trying to seem truthful but there's a tiny bit of tension." But given what I see—no obvious red flags, consistent eye contact, and no nervous fidgeting—I'd probably lean toward them telling the truth, even if they're a little tense. But I wouldn't bet money on it; it's really subtle. Maybe it's just them being thoughtful, not deceptive.

Looking at this clip, I’m trying to figure out if they’re being truthful or not, and honestly, it’s a bit of a toss-up. At first glance, the way they’re holding their gaze—looking up instead of away or down—stands out to me. I’ve read that when people are recalling actual memories (like when telling the truth), they often look up or to the side, whereas lying might make them avoid eye contact or glance down. So that part feels like it’s leaning toward truth. They also have those subtle lip corners up, like a tiny, genuine smile—not forced or exaggerated—and raised eyebrows, which often show surprise or engagement, not deception. Those micro-expressions seem natural, not like they’re trying too hard to seem sincere.

But then there’s the mouth covering and touching their head. I’ve seen people do that when they’re nervous, and nervousness can sometimes come with lying. Like, covering the mouth might be an unconscious attempt to hold back a false statement. And the head-touching feels a bit like fidgeting, which people do when they’re stressed. If they were lying, those could be signs. But here’s the thing: I’ve also seen people do those things when they’re just thinking hard, or maybe they’re shy about being on camera. Like, I’ve done that myself when I’m trying to remember something—no deception involved, just being a little awkward.

The other thing is, they’re not showing any classic "lie signs" like frowning, excessive blinking, or avoiding eye contact entirely. If they were fabricating something, I’d expect more of those. Instead, the behavior feels... calm, even. The raised eyebrows and slight smile don’t read as defensive or guarded. It’s hard to say for sure, but I’m leaning toward them telling the truth because the cues that *do* match truth-telling (gaze up, natural micro-expressions) outweigh the ambiguous ones (mouth covering). But I’m not 100% certain—nervousness can look like lying, and sometimes people cover their mouths for no reason at all. If I had to guess without knowing the context, I’d say it’s probably truth, but I’d still wonder if they’re just really tense about the situation. It’s one of those clips where you can’t rule out either possibility, but the evidence seems to point more toward honesty than deception.

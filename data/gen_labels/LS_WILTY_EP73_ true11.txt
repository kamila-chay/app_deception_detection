Honestly, I'm a bit torn watching this clip, and I don't want to overstate it. The person seems pretty calm overall, which makes me lean toward truth, but I know body language can be tricky. They're making direct eye contact with the person asking the question—that's usually a good sign for honesty, right? Liars often avoid eye contact, so that feels reassuring. But then there's the frowning eyebrows and raised eyebrows at the same time, which looks like they're genuinely confused or processing something hard, not necessarily lying. And they're blinking a lot, which could just mean they're stressed about the question, not that they're hiding something. Like, if I was trying to remember a detail under pressure, I might blink a lot too.  

On the flip side, the frequent blinking and the slight frown *do* look a bit tense, which sometimes happens when people are lying. I've heard that nervous habits like that can be signs of deception. But then again, they're not doing any of the classic "tells"—no lip biting, no hand fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact. The fact that they're not shifting around or covering their mouth makes me think they're not trying to hide anything. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical signs of anxiety, like scratching or looking away more.  

The gaze down part is confusing me a little too. Sometimes people look down when they're being truthful and thoughtful, not when they're lying. Like when you're trying to recall something carefully. So maybe they're just concentrating, not hiding.  

Honestly, I think the direct eye contact and lack of other nervous habits outweigh the blinking and frown for me. It feels like they're being genuine but maybe a bit stressed about the question itself—not because they're lying, but because it's a tough thing to answer. I wouldn't bet money on it, but if I had to guess based on what I see, I'd say they're telling the truth. But I'm not 100% sure—sometimes people are really good at hiding it, and sometimes stress just makes you look tense even when you're honest. It’s one of those cases where the absence of "lying" cues is probably more telling than the few nervous ones they have.

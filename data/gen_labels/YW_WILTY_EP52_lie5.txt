This is a bit challenging to determine definitively from the video alone, but based on what I’m observing, I’m inclined to lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. They maintain consistent eye contact, which at first might suggest honesty, but sometimes people who are lying actually overdo their gaze to appear truthful. The raised eyebrows, which occur a few times during their response, could signal stress or an attempt to seem surprised—both potential indicators of someone trying to mask discomfort or fabricating a story. It’s possible that these eyebrow movements are nervous tics triggered when caught off guard.

On the other hand, raised eyebrows can also be a natural reaction or a way to emphasize a point, so they don’t definitively point to deception by themselves. What’s noteworthy is that the person shows no other classic signs of lying, such as fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or awkward pauses. Their steady gaze and lack of other obvious cues might suggest sincerity. Still, considering the possibility that overmaintained eye contact and eyebrow raises could be deliberate attempts to convince, I find myself leaning a bit more toward thinking they might not be entirely truthful. Without more context or contradictory information, it’s hard to be certain, but the subtle signs present here make me suspect there could be some deception involved.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person is making consistent eye contact with the other person—gaze toward interlocutor is definitely on—and they're raising their eyebrows a few times while they're talking. Like, not just once, but a couple of times during their response. That's the main thing standing out. 

Now, on the one hand, I've heard that people who are lying sometimes *over*-maintain eye contact to seem honest, so that could be a sign they're trying too hard to appear truthful. The raised eyebrows too—sometimes that happens when someone's stressed or trying to seem surprised, which might fit with deception. Like, if they're rehearsing a story and get caught off guard by a question, their eyebrows might jump up as a nervous tic. 

But then, I'm also thinking: raised eyebrows can just be a natural reaction, right? Maybe they genuinely are surprised by what they're being asked, or they're emphasizing something in their answer. And honestly, they're not doing *anything* else that screams "liar"—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no fake smiles or awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic signs, like fiddling with their hands or looking away. The fact that they're holding steady eye contact and just raising their eyebrows feels... kind of neutral, maybe even genuine? Like, if I were nervous about something, I might do that too without even realizing it. 

I guess I'm leaning a little toward them *not* lying, but I'm not sure. It's hard because the eyebrows alone aren't enough to go on. If this was a longer clip or I saw more context—like if they were contradicting themselves or the question was clearly about something they'd have to lie about—I'd feel more confident. But as it is, it just feels like they're a little expressive while answering, not necessarily deceptive. Still, I can't rule it out completely. It's one of those moments where you just have to go with the gut, and mine's saying "probably truthful," but I'd want to see more before I'd bet on it.

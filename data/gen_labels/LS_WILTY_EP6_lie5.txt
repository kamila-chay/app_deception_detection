Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful here. Honestly, it's tricky because people act differently when they're nervous or just uncomfortable. What stands out to me is how often they're covering their mouth with their hands—like, they do it a few times while talking, especially when answering questions. I've heard that covering the mouth can sometimes signal discomfort or hiding something, so that makes me lean a little toward deception. But I know it's not a sure thing—maybe they just have a habit of doing that when they're concentrating, or maybe they're just tired and rubbing their face without thinking.

Then there's the head shaking while they're nodding. They shake their head "no" once or twice, but then immediately nod "yes" to the same thing. That feels a bit confusing—like they're trying to agree but also pushing back at the same time. It's the kind of thing I'd associate with someone trying to sound convincing while secretly doubting themselves. But I keep thinking: could that just be a natural, unconscious gesture? Like, maybe they're genuinely trying to process the question and their body's just reacting. It's hard to tell without knowing the context.

Their gaze is another thing. They look directly at the person asking the questions most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—people often avoid eye contact when lying. But they also glance sideways a couple of times, which might mean they're not fully engaged or are searching for words. Still, that sideways glance could just be them thinking, not necessarily lying. And the chin moving upward? I noticed that a bit—like a slight lift when they're speaking. I'm not sure what to make of that; it might be a nervous tic or just how they talk, not a clear deception cue.

On the flip side, they're not doing the classic "lie signs" like fidgeting a lot, avoiding eye contact, or smiling unnaturally. They seem pretty calm otherwise—no exaggerated expressions or frantic blinking. That makes me wonder if it's just a normal conversation where I'm overthinking it. Maybe they're not lying at all, and I'm just looking for patterns that aren't there. I mean, people cover their mouths for all sorts of reasons—maybe they just have a dry mouth or are trying not to laugh at something.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The mouth covering and the head-shake/nod combo are making me lean toward deception, but the direct eye contact and lack of other tells are pulling me the other way. It feels like a maybe—like they might be hiding something, but it's not obvious enough to be certain. I'd say it's probably deception based on what I see, but I'd want to hear more of the conversation or see them in a different context before I'd feel confident about it. It's just hard to tell with just a few seconds of video.

Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually leans toward honesty, though I know some people practice that when they're lying. They're also looking up occasionally, which sometimes happens when people are recalling memories, but that could just mean they're thinking hard about what they're saying. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" tells like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or over-the-top gestures. Their palms are up, which feels open and non-defensive—like they're trying to seem genuine. And the head shaking? It's not a big, aggressive shake, just a subtle side-to-side thing, almost like they're just emphasizing a point while agreeing.  

But then again, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Some people naturally look up when they talk, or they might shake their head as a habit without meaning anything by it. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact *could* be a sign of truth, but I've heard that some skilled liars actually *overdo* eye contact to seem trustworthy. And that "gaze up" detail—while it's often linked to truth-telling (like when retrieving actual memories), it could also be a sign they're fabricating something, since liars sometimes look up to "construct" a story. The palms up is reassuring, but I've seen people do that even when they're not being honest, especially if they're trying to appear calm.  

Honestly, the absence of stress cues (no rapid blinking, no lip biting, no crossed arms) makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not sure. It's possible they're just a naturally composed person who doesn't show nervousness easily. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth—not because they're perfect, but because they're not doing the things that usually scream "lying." But I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Like, maybe they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe they're lying so smoothly it's hard to tell. Either way, I don't see anything that makes me think they're actively deceiving me. It just feels... steady. Like they're not hiding anything. But yeah, I'm not 100% certain—human behavior is messy like that.

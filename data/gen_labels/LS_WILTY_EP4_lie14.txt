Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I lean toward the possibility that they might be lying. While they maintain direct eye contact and have open arms, which usually suggest honesty, other cues raise some doubts. Their blinking is noticeably frequent—much more than usual—which often indicates stress or discomfort, common signs when someone is being untruthful. Additionally, the slight downturn of their mouth corners gives an impression of tension, as if they are holding something back. These subtle signs don’t quite align with someone who is completely relaxed or sincere.

That said, there’s still some uncertainty. The individual could simply be nervous or tired, which might explain the rapid blinking and facial tension without necessarily pointing to deception. Moreover, their nodding and leaning forward could be genuine engagement or an attempt to appear more credible, behaviors that both truthful and deceptive people might display.

Overall, while there are plausible innocent explanations, the combination of these stress-related cues makes me lean toward thinking they may not be fully truthful. I wouldn’t say it’s certain, but based on the behavior observed, deception seems to be the more likely scenario.

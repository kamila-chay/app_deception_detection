Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call without more context, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them possibly being deceptive, though I'm not 100% certain. Let me walk through why I'm hesitating.  

On one hand, they're maintaining steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze toward interlocutor is true—and their arms are open, which usually signals openness or honesty in most contexts. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, and they're not smiling or laughing in a way that feels forced. If they were just being truthful, those cues would typically point toward sincerity. The absence of nervous gestures like hand rubbing or frequent blinking also feels more consistent with someone who's not hiding something.  

But then there's the eyebrow-raising. It's subtle but noticeable—not a full surprise, more like a slight, almost involuntary lift. In my experience, that kind of micro-expression can sometimes pop up when someone's trying to seem innocent or is subtly signaling "I'm not lying" to themselves, which ironically might happen when they *are* lying. It's not a classic "lie" tell like avoiding eye contact, but it's a bit off-kilter for someone who's relaxed. And the open arms... well, sometimes people do that *more* when they're trying to appear trustworthy, especially if they're aware they're being scrutinized.  

I keep second-guessing though. Maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question—like, "Wait, why are you asking that?"—and the eyebrows are just a natural reaction. Or maybe the open arms are just their default posture, not a calculated move. The video doesn't show the full context of the conversation, so it's hard to tell if they're answering a sensitive question or just chatting casually. If they were telling the truth, the eye contact and lack of fidgeting would actually be pretty strong signs. But if they're lying, they might be overcompensating with the open arms and eye contact to seem calm, while the eyebrows betray a tiny bit of tension.  

Honestly, I'm stuck between two interpretations. The cues aren't screaming "liar," but they're not screaming "truthful" either. It feels like they're trying *too* hard to look relaxed, which makes me lean toward deception, but I could easily be wrong. Without more context—like what they're being asked about or their baseline behavior—I'd say it's a maybe. If I had to guess, I'd say deception is possible, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to see the whole conversation to be sure.

Honestly, watching this clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'm leaning a bit toward them not lying. The first thing that stands out is how wide their eyes are open—like, really exaggeratedly wide, almost like they're trying to look extra attentive or maybe a little startled. That kind of exaggerated eye opening can sometimes happen when someone's nervous or rehearsing, but it also happens when people are genuinely surprised or trying to emphasize something. I've seen people do that when they're telling the truth and just really want you to believe them, so it's not a dead giveaway for lying.

Then there's the way they're looking at the person they're talking to—directly most of the time, which usually feels more honest. But they also glance sideways a few times, which could mean they're thinking or maybe a bit distracted, not necessarily lying. And their hands are palms up, open and relaxed, which people often do when they're being upfront. No fidgeting, no covering their mouth, no avoiding eye contact—those are all things I'd expect to see more if they were hiding something. 

But here's where I get stuck: the exaggerated eyes still nag at me. If they were just being natural, why would their eyes get so big? Maybe they're trying too hard to seem calm or sincere, which could be a sign they're nervous about being caught in a lie. I mean, people who lie sometimes overdo the "good" signals to seem trustworthy—like forcing a smile or making their eyes big. So that part *could* point to deception. 

On the flip side, maybe they're just naturally expressive, or the lighting made their eyes look wider, or they're genuinely excited about what they're saying. The lack of other tells—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles—makes me think it's less likely they're lying. If they were, I'd expect more subtle signs, like maybe shifting in their seat or touching their face. 

Honestly, it's a tough call. The eyes are weirdly big, but everything else feels pretty calm and open. I guess I'd say I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It could just be their normal way of talking, or maybe they're just really into the conversation. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably not lying, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words before I'd feel confident. You know? It's just hard to tell from just the body language alone.

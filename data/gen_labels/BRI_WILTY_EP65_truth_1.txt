Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching this person answer a question, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure. They have this raised eyebrow thing going on, like they're genuinely surprised or questioning what they're hearing, and their eyes keep darting sideways instead of looking straight at the person asking. That sideways glance... it *does* make me think maybe they're not entirely comfortable, or maybe they're trying to remember something. Sometimes when people lie, they avoid direct eye contact like that, or their eyebrows go up in a "wait, what?" way that feels off.

But then, the other thing that stands out is their hands—palms facing up, open. That's usually seen as a sign of openness or honesty, right? Like they're not hiding anything. And they're not fidgeting, not smiling nervously, not laughing awkwardly. They're just... sitting there with that raised eyebrow and sideways look. It feels a bit like they're genuinely processing the question, maybe because it's unexpected or they're trying to be careful with their answer, not because they're making something up. I mean, people get nervous when they're being asked things, especially if it's serious, and that nervousness can look like lying to someone watching without context.

The thing is, I've seen so many videos where people look "shifty" but are actually just thinking hard or feeling awkward about the situation. That raised eyebrow might just be them being genuinely surprised by the question, not trying to cover up a lie. And the palms up... that's a strong indicator for me that they're not trying to conceal anything. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact *more* intensely, or maybe even a forced smile. But here, it's just that one little eyebrow lift and the sideways glance. It feels more like someone who's being careful with their words than someone who's actively deceiving.

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. My gut leans toward them being truthful because of the open palms and the lack of other stress cues, but I can totally see why someone else might think the sideways look and raised eyebrows point to lying. It's not a clear-cut case. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—I'd want to hear more context or see more of their usual behavior. It feels like they're just being thoughtful, not deceptive.

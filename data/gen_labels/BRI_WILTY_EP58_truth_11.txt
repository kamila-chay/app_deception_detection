Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward this person being truthful, but I'm not 100% certain—these things can be tricky. They're making consistent eye contact with the other person while they talk, which usually feels more natural when someone's being honest. I also notice they're raising their eyebrows a few times, like when they're surprised or emphasizing something, not like they're trying to hide something. Their chin moves up a bit when they're talking, which might just be them being animated or thinking, not necessarily nervousness. And they're not fidgeting—no lip biting, no hands covering their face, nothing that screams "I'm lying here." 

That said, I can see why someone might second-guess it. The way they look down sometimes while speaking could make people think they're avoiding eye contact, but from what I've seen, people often glance down when they're concentrating or recalling something, not just when they're lying. And the chin thing... I've heard some people say chin lifts mean deception, but honestly, I'm not sure if that's a real thing or just a myth. It could just be how they talk. Plus, they have a small, genuine-looking smile—not forced or fake—while they're explaining things, which usually lines up with being truthful. 

The biggest thing is, there's no real "red flag" behavior here. Liars often have a lot of those nervous tells—like excessive blinking, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting—but this person doesn't seem to have any of that. Still, I know humans are bad at spotting lies, and sometimes people get nervous even when they're telling the truth. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but I'd also be cautious about being too sure. It just feels... calm, like they're just sharing something they believe. But I'm not going to bet my life on it.

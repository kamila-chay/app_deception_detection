Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're not fidgeting, not smiling unnaturally, and they're actually making eye contact when they're talking, which usually leans toward truthfulness. But there's this thing where they keep looking down while they're speaking, even though they're facing the person they're talking to. It's not like they're avoiding eye contact entirely, but the way their gaze drops downward while they're answering questions... that's the part that sticks out to me. I've heard that when people are being deceptive, they often glance away or down more than usual, like they're processing something they don't want to reveal. 

But then I think, "Wait, maybe they're just thinking hard or feeling shy?" I mean, they're not making any of the classic 'liar' tells—no excessive blinking, no tense jaw, no hands covering their mouth. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like fidgeting or that stiff, forced smile people sometimes do. Instead, they seem almost too relaxed, which honestly makes me second-guess. Sometimes when people are being truthful but anxious, they *do* look down a lot, especially if they're trying to be careful with their words. 

The head tilt to the side is another thing—I noticed that too. It could be a natural gesture, like they're listening intently, but I've also seen that in some deception studies as a subtle sign of internal conflict. Still, it's so minor, and without more context, it's hard to say. I guess my gut leans toward deception because of that downcast gaze combined with the head tilt, but I keep wondering if I'm overthinking it. Like, maybe they're just tired or distracted, not lying. Honestly, it's not a clear-cut case. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe deception, but I'd want to see more of the conversation or their usual behavior first before being sure. It's one of those moments where you're like, "Hmm, that feels off, but I can't prove it."

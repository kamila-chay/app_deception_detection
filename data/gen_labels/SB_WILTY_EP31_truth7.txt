Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like a good sign—people who are lying sometimes avoid eye contact, but here they're holding it steady. Their gaze is also up a bit, which I've heard can mean they're trying to recall something from memory, and that's often more common when people are telling the truth instead of fabricating. Plus, their arms are open, not crossed or folded, which usually reads as more relaxed and open, not defensive. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" tells either—no frowning, no rapid blinking, no hands fidgeting or covering their face. That part makes me lean toward them being honest, because liars often show more physical stress.

But then there's that head shaking. They're shaking their head side-to-side, which usually means "no" or "I disagree," and it's happening while they're speaking. That throws me off a little because if they're saying something like "I didn't do it," shaking their head could feel like they're reinforcing it, but it also feels a bit contradictory—like why would they shake their head "no" while confirming the truth? Maybe it's just a habit, or maybe it's a cultural thing, or perhaps they're shaking it to dismiss a doubt they're hearing, not denying what they're saying. I've seen people do that before—like, "No, really, I'm telling you the truth," and the head shake is part of emphasizing it. So it might not actually be a lie signal here.

On the other hand, if it *were* a lie, I'd expect more of those nervous cues—like shifting eyes or a tight jaw—but they're not showing any of that. The fact that they're relaxed, engaged, and using open body language feels more consistent with truth-telling. Head shaking alone isn't enough to override all that, especially since it's not clear what it's reacting to. I'm not 100% sure, but after watching it a couple times, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth. It's not a slam dunk, though—there's always room for misinterpretation, especially with gestures that can mean different things depending on context. But based on what's visible, the absence of stress signs seems to outweigh the head shake confusion.

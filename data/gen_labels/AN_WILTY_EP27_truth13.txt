Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and steady. They're not smiling, laughing, or making any exaggerated facial expressions—I don't see them frowning or raising their eyebrows either. Their eyes are mostly looking down, not meeting the camera or the person they're talking to, and they're not fidgeting with their hands or touching their face. There's no nervous blinking or awkward pauses where they seem stuck for words. Honestly, that lack of obvious "tells" makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure.  

I know some people think liars avoid eye contact, but I've read that's not always true—truth-tellers often look down when they're thinking or being sincere, especially if they're a bit shy or just focused on what they're saying. Maybe they're just naturally quiet or uncomfortable in this situation, not lying. The downward gaze could be because they're concentrating, or maybe they're genuinely embarrassed about the topic, which wouldn't necessarily mean they're hiding something.  

On the flip side, though, if they *were* lying, they might be really good at hiding it—some people don't show any physical signs of stress at all. And the fact that they're not looking up or making eye contact *could* still feel a bit off to some people, even if it's not a reliable sign. I mean, I've seen people look down while being completely honest, but I've also seen people who lie without seeming nervous. It's hard to tell just from this alone.  

All in all, the video doesn't give me any strong reasons to think they're lying—no fidgeting, no forced expressions, no signs of stress. But I wouldn't bet money on it either. It just seems like they're being calm and straightforward, which makes me think they're probably telling the truth, but I guess you'd need more context to be sure. Like, if they were answering something super personal or controversial, the downcast eyes might mean something else. For now, though, it feels like they're just being themselves.

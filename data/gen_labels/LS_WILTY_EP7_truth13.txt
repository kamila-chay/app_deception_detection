Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together whether they're being truthful or not based on what I'm seeing. They're definitely making eye contact with whoever they're talking to, and they're nodding along while they speak—that feels like they're engaged and trying to be clear, which usually lines up with someone telling the truth. But there's this constant frowning and a lot of blinking, which makes me pause. Frowning can sometimes mean they're stressed or confused about the question, not necessarily lying—maybe they're just thinking hard or genuinely upset about the topic. And blinking a lot? That's a classic sign people associate with nervousness, but honestly, I've seen people blink like that when they're just tired or staring at a screen, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, why would they keep looking directly at the person they're talking to? Most people who lie tend to avoid eye contact or look away more, so that part feels contradictory. The nodding also seems like it's in sync with what they're saying, not like they're trying to force agreement. But then again, some people practice "lying with confidence," so they might be deliberately keeping eye contact to seem honest. The frowning still bugs me though—like, is that frustration about the question, or is it a stress response? I can't tell for sure.  

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The blinking and frown make me lean toward them being a bit stressed or uncomfortable, but that doesn't automatically mean they're lying. It could just be them being earnest and maybe a little anxious about the situation. The other cues—like no lip biting, no hand movements, no avoiding the gaze—actually feel more consistent with someone being truthful, even if the frown and blinking are throwing me off. I'd probably guess they're telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. Like, maybe they're just a very expressive person, or the question was genuinely upsetting. It’s one of those cases where the body language isn't screaming "liar," but it's not a clear "truth" either. I’d say it’s probably truth, but I’d want to hear more context before I’d feel confident.

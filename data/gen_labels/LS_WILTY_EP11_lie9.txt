Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior seems pretty neutral at first glance. They're making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But then I notice they keep glancing sideways—like, not just a quick look away, but a distinct sideways shift of their gaze. That part makes me pause because I've heard that sometimes when people are being deceptive, they avoid direct eye contact or look off to the side while thinking. So that *could* be a red flag.

But wait, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Maybe they're just naturally looking sideways when they're thinking, or maybe they're trying to be attentive but their eyes drift a bit. I've seen people do that all the time without it meaning anything dishonest—they're just processing what they're saying. And honestly, there's almost nothing else going on: no nervous fidgeting, no fake smiles, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed tight, no raised eyebrows or anything like that. The whole thing feels... calm. Too calm? Sometimes liars try to be *too* composed, but this doesn't feel forced. It just feels like someone who's speaking normally, maybe a little focused.

The thing that really makes me uncertain is that sideways glance. It's there, but it's not dramatic or constant—it's subtle. If it were a big, obvious shift away, I'd lean toward deception, but this feels more like a habitual thing. Like, maybe they just have a slight habit of looking sideways when they're talking, and it's nothing to do with lying. I mean, I've done it myself while explaining something simple. So yeah, I'm torn. On one hand, the sideways gaze *could* hint at something, but on the other, the lack of other classic "lie" signs (like tension or forced calm) makes me think it might just be their natural way of speaking. I'd probably need to hear the actual words or see more of the interaction to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward "not lying" because the rest of their behavior is so relaxed, but I'm definitely not sure. It's one of those moments where your gut says "maybe," but you know you shouldn't trust your gut too much with this stuff.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a good sign—people who are lying sometimes avoid eye contact, but not always. They're also nodding along and leaning their head forward a bit, which seems like they're engaged and listening, not trying to deflect. That makes me lean toward them being genuine, at least on the surface.

But then there's this exaggerated eye closing they do—like, they really squeeze their eyes shut for a second. I've heard some people say that's a sign of lying, like they're "thinking" or trying to fabricate something, but I'm not sure. It could just be a nervous habit, or maybe they're emphasizing a point, like "I'm really sure about this." And they keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like, when they're saying something, their eyebrows go up high. That's usually a sign of surprise or interest, not lying, but sometimes people do it when they're stressed. 

The sideways glance they make a couple of times also threw me off for a second. Some folks think looking away means hiding something, but I've read that it's actually more common when people are recalling details or thinking, which could be neutral or even truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting—like touching their face or arms—but they're just sitting still, hands in their lap, no big movements. That feels a bit odd for someone who's nervous about lying, but maybe they're just calm. 

On the flip side, the exaggerated eye closing *does* stand out a bit. If they were being completely honest, I wonder why they'd do that so noticeably. Could it be a way to seem more sincere? Like, "I'm so sure, I'll close my eyes to focus"? But then again, it might just be a quirk of their speech patterns. Honestly, I'm not sure. The cues here don't scream "liar," but they also don't scream "truth" either. It feels like they're being genuine, but the eye thing is making me second-guess. Maybe they're just a little nervous, which happens to everyone, even when telling the truth. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% confident—I'd need to see more context or hear the actual words to feel better about it. It's hard to judge just from body language alone, you know?

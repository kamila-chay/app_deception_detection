Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly? It's a bit tricky. They're definitely holding eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that "gaze towards interlocutor" part is clear—and they're looking up a bit while they speak, which I've heard some people say can be a sign of recalling something, but I'm not sure if that's reliable. Their eyebrows are raised and kind of furrowed at the same time, which feels like they're really concentrating or maybe a little stressed about what they're saying. And their lips are pushed out a bit, like they're puckering slightly—maybe they're just nervous or thinking hard, but I've also heard that can sometimes happen when people are trying to control their expression when lying.

On the other hand, there's a lot that *isn't* happening that makes me second-guess the "lying" idea. They're not smiling, not laughing, not blinking a lot, not covering their mouth, not fidgeting with their hands at all—those are all things I'd expect to see more if someone was trying to hide something. The fact they're maintaining steady eye contact while doing this feels more like someone who's trying to be honest, even if they're a bit tense. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "nervous" signs, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting. Here, it seems like they're just... focused, maybe even a little frustrated with themselves about how to answer.

But then again, maybe they're good at hiding it? I've seen people who seem super calm when they're lying, so the lack of obvious tells might not mean anything. The raised eyebrows and the frown could also just be because they're genuinely confused by the question, not because they're lying. Like, maybe they're trying to remember something and it's annoying them, so they're frowning while they think. The lip protrusion might just be a habit—they do that when they're thinking, right?

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful because the absence of the expected "lie" behaviors feels more significant than the ambiguous ones. But I'm not 100% sure. It's really hard to tell from just a video alone—people get stressed for all kinds of reasons, and this might just be someone who's naturally a bit intense when they're trying to answer something carefully. I'd want to hear more of the conversation or see them in a different context to be sure. For now, I'd say it's probably not deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

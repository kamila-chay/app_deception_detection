I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always clear-cut. What stands out to me is that they're actually maintaining eye contact the whole time—they're looking directly at whoever they're talking to, which feels like a good sign for truthfulness. But they also keep shifting their gaze up and down a bit, which sometimes people associate with lying (like when someone's trying to recall something), but I'm not sure if that's the case here. They're not avoiding eye contact entirely, which makes me think it might just be them thinking or emphasizing points, not being deceptive.  

Their head movements also seem natural—tilting it slightly and turning it sideways a few times. I've noticed that head tilting often happens when people are engaged or curious, not when they're hiding something. And they're touching their own head or face occasionally—like running a hand through their hair or adjusting their collar—which I've heard can mean someone's processing thoughts, not necessarily being nervous. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding physical contact, but this feels more like someone who's just comfortable and thoughtful.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Gaze shifts *can* be a red flag in some contexts, especially if they're looking up a lot, but since they're still making eye contact with the other person, it doesn't seem like they're avoiding the conversation. And the fact that they're not smiling or frowning (which the description says) means there's no obvious emotional mismatch—like someone forcing a smile while lying. But yeah, I'm not 100% certain because body language depends so much on the person's normal habits. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're just really focused on what they're saying.  

All in all, the cues I'm seeing—steady eye contact, engaged head movements, and neutral facial expressions—lean toward them being truthful. But I'd need more context to be sure. Like, if this were a high-stakes situation, I'd be more cautious, but based on this clip alone, it feels like they're just being genuine. I guess I'd say "truth" with some hesitation, but not like I'm absolutely sure. It's just... the vibe feels honest.

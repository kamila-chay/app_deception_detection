Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems to be looking right at the camera the whole time—like they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels a bit unusual if they're trying to hide something. Usually, people who lie might glance away more, but here they're holding that gaze steady. They're also nodding along while speaking, which often shows engagement or agreement, not deception. And they're shaking their head a little—like they're saying "no" to something—but it's not wild or exaggerated, just a subtle movement. 

But then there's the chin thing... they keep lifting it slightly upward, like they're holding their head up a bit higher than normal. I've heard that can sometimes signal defensiveness or tension, which people might do when lying. But I'm not sure—it could just be how they naturally carry themselves, or maybe they're just thinking hard about what they're saying. And the head shake... if they're shaking it while saying "yes," that'd be a classic sign of inconsistency, but I don't know the context of the conversation. Maybe they're just dismissing a question casually. 

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" I've read about: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. In fact, the nodding and steady gaze feel more like someone who's being honest and trying to connect. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy—like hands moving around or looking away—but here it's pretty calm. 

Still, I can't rule out deception entirely. Maybe they're just really practiced at hiding it, or maybe the head shake is a deliberate "no" to something they're denying. But honestly, based on what I'm seeing, the behaviors lean more toward being truthful. The eye contact and nodding are strong indicators for me, and the other things—like the chin lift—could easily be misinterpreted. I'd probably lean toward "not lying" if I had to guess, but I'm definitely not 100% sure. It's one of those cases where the absence of obvious lies might actually be the bigger clue.

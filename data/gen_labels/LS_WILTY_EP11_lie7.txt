Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them not being completely truthful. The first thing that stands out is how often they're blinking—like, *way* more than normal, almost like they're trying to avoid looking at the camera or the person they're talking to. And their eyes keep darting down, not up or straight ahead, which I've heard people say sometimes happens when someone's making something up. They also keep moving their chin up and down, like little jerky motions, and their head's shifting forward and backward while they're speaking, plus turning side to side a bit. That all feels kind of tense, like they're physically struggling to stay calm.

But here's where I hesitate—I don't want to jump to conclusions. Maybe they're just really nervous about being on camera or in the situation, not lying. I know some people blink a lot when they're anxious, and looking down could just be shyness or thinking hard, not deception. The way their head moves might even be a habit for them, like how some people fidget with their hands but don't mean anything by it. And they're not smiling or laughing, which I'd expect if they were being playful or comfortable, but that could just mean they're serious about the topic. 

I guess the thing that tips me toward deception is the combination—blinking *and* avoiding eye contact *and* those small, tense head movements all together. It doesn't feel like natural behavior to me. But I'm still not 100% sure because it's easy to misread someone's body language. If I were guessing, I'd say they're probably not telling the whole truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd feel confident about it. Like, maybe they're just bad at hiding stress, not lying. It's really hard to say for sure without knowing what they're even talking about.

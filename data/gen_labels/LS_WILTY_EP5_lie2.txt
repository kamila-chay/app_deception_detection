Looking at this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky. On one hand, the way they're blinking a lot and the exaggerated eye closing makes me think they're nervous or trying to control their expressions, which often happens when people are being deceptive. Their eyebrows keep raising like they're processing something they don't want to admit, and that head shaking and sideways glance feels like they're avoiding direct eye contact, which I've heard is a common sign of discomfort when lying. The arms being open might seem like they're being honest, but sometimes people do that to seem more relaxed while they're actually stressed.  

But honestly, it could also be totally innocent. Some people just blink a lot naturally, or their eyebrows do that when they're thinking hard, not necessarily hiding something. The smile they give feels a bit forced, but maybe they're just trying to be polite or happy about the topic, not lying. And that sideways gaze? Could just mean they're looking at something else in the room, or they're just not used to being on camera. I've seen people with nervous habits like that who are completely truthful—like if they're anxious about speaking in public, not about the content.  

I guess I'm leaning toward deception because of the combination of the frequent blinking, the exaggerated eye movements, and the head gestures all pointing to tension, but I'm not confident at all. It's easy to misread body language, especially without knowing the context. Maybe they're just really uncomfortable in general, not lying. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear what they're saying before I'd feel sure. At this point, I'd say it's plausible they're hiding something, but it's definitely not certain.

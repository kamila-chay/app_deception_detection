Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly? It's tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like forced smiles or nervous laughter, which is interesting because you'd expect more of that if they were lying. But they *are* blinking a lot, and their lips are pulled back slightly with the corners down, which usually makes me think of stress or discomfort. I've seen that before in people who are just really focused or maybe a bit tired, though—not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're trying to remember something clearly, and that's why they're blinking so much.  

The way they're looking up while talking also stands out. I've read that when people recall real memories, they often look up or away, whereas liars might look down or avoid eye contact. But then again, I've also heard that some people naturally look up when they're thinking, regardless of whether they're lying. And the head tilting? That's usually a sign of curiosity or processing, not deception. It feels neutral to me.  

On the flip side, the lip retraction and downturned corners *could* be signs of anxiety, which sometimes comes with lying. But I'm not sure—it might just be their default expression when they're concentrating. Like, maybe they're just not a very expressive person, or they're in a room with bad lighting making their face feel stiff. And honestly, the *absence* of classic "lie signs" (like frowning, fake smiles, or avoiding eye contact entirely) actually makes me lean toward them being truthful. Liars often try way too hard to seem relaxed, so they might overdo the smiling or stiffen up more. Here, they seem pretty natural, just a bit tense in a way that could be normal.  

Still, I can't be 100% sure. Frequent blinking happens to everyone—maybe they have dry eyes, or the camera light is bothering them. And without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to judge. If they're talking about something emotionally heavy, that lip tension might just be from feeling upset, not deception. I think I'd go with "probably truthful" based on the lack of exaggerated cues, but I'd also say it's easy to misread. Like, I've been fooled before by people who were just nervous about the video being recorded, not because they were lying. So yeah, I'd say truth, but with a lot of "could be" and "maybe."

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit confusing because some of their body language seems like it could go either way. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's one thing that makes me lean toward them being truthful, since I've heard liars often avoid direct gaze, though I know that's not always true. Their arms are open, which usually feels like an honest, approachable posture to me, and they're tilting their head a bit while listening, which often shows engagement or curiosity, not deception. 

But then there's the part where they keep touching their head or face—like, they'll brush their hair or adjust their collar while they're talking. That *could* be a sign of nervousness, which sometimes happens when people are lying, but honestly, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking or feeling a little awkward, not necessarily lying. And their chin lifts up a bit when they speak, which I'm not sure about—maybe it's just a habit or how they emphasize points. 

What throws me off is how calm everything else seems. No fidgeting with hands, no avoiding eye contact, no signs of stress like rapid blinking or tense lips. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells, but they're missing here. It's possible they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not stressed at all because they're actually being honest. I mean, I've known people who get super fidgety when telling the truth about something they're nervous about, so it's not a perfect sign. 

At the end of the day, the open posture and steady eye contact feel more like someone who's comfortable, but I can't rule out that the head-touching is a sign of something. I'd say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth just based on how relaxed and engaged they seem overall, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those cases where you'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

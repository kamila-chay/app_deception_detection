Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems a bit tense but not obviously deceptive. They’re not making eye contact with whoever they’re talking to—looking down and sideways a lot—while keeping their head up. Their lips are pulled back slightly, like they’re holding in a reaction, and they don’t smile or laugh at all. At first glance, that avoidance of eye contact might make me think they’re hiding something, because people often look away when they’re lying. But then I remember that not everyone does that, especially if they’re just shy or distracted, or maybe they’re from a culture where direct eye contact feels uncomfortable even when being honest. The fact that they’re not frowning, blinking a lot, or doing those little nervous gestures like touching their face makes me hesitate. If they were lying, I’d expect more of those classic "tells"—like the exaggerated mouth movements or the awkward pauses they’re not doing here. The head being up feels a bit like they’re trying to stay composed, which could go either way: either they’re trying to seem confident while lying, or they’re just genuinely focused on what they’re saying without needing to fidget. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. The behavior doesn’t scream "lying," but it’s not a clear "truth" either. I’d lean toward them being truthful because the lack of strong deception cues seems more telling than the gaze and lip thing alone, but I’m not at all certain. Maybe they’re just nervous about the topic, not the truth itself.

Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that stiff, forced smile people sometimes get when they're lying. They're actually sitting with their arms wide open, which usually feels like a relaxed, open posture to me—like they're not trying to hide anything. And their gaze? They're looking straight up a few times, not down at their hands or away from the person they're talking to. I know some people say looking up can be a sign of lying (like they're fabricating something), but I've also heard it's just how some people think or recall things. It felt neutral to me, not like a "lie" gesture.

But here's where I hesitate: I'm not sure if that "arms open" thing is actually a reliable clue. Like, maybe they just naturally sit that way, or maybe they're trying *too* hard to seem open and trustworthy? Sometimes people who are lying will overdo the "relaxed" stuff to cover up. And the fact they're not making eye contact—well, they're not looking *at* the person either, which could be either a sign of truth (if they're just thinking) or a sign of lying (if they're avoiding the gaze). It's really hard to tell from just that. 

What stands out to me is how *still* they are otherwise—no exaggerated movements, no lip biting, no weird blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little nervous tells, right? But they're just... calm. So that leans toward truth for me. But yeah, I'm not 100% sure. It's possible they're just a really good liar who doesn't show the usual signs, or maybe they're just naturally this composed. Honestly, without more context—like what they're actually saying or the situation—I can't be certain. I guess I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just based on the lack of stress signals, but I'd want to hear the whole conversation to feel better about it. It's a tough one.

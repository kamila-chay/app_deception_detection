Looking at the clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I can see why someone might think they're being deceptive. The person's eyes are blinking way more than usual—like, constantly—while they're talking, and they keep looking down or sideways instead of meeting the other person's eyes. That kind of avoidance and the heavy blinking often make me think someone's stressed or hiding something, especially if they're trying to keep their story straight. They also shrug at one point, which feels like they're downplaying something, maybe to seem casual when they're not. 

But honestly, I'm not convinced it's definite. I've seen people who just naturally blink a lot, or get nervous in interviews even when they're telling the truth—like if they're shy or the situation feels awkward. The way they're tilting their head could just be them listening carefully, not necessarily being sneaky. And the shrug? That could mean they genuinely don't know the answer, not that they're lying. Like, if someone asks a question they can't recall, they shrug to say "I don't have that info," which is totally honest. 

The thing is, there's no obvious sign like frowning, lip biting, or avoiding eye contact *completely*—they do look at the other person sometimes, just not consistently. And no fake smiles or laughter, which some people think is a liar's tell, but I've learned that's not reliable. Maybe they're just a quiet person, or the topic is uncomfortable for a reason that has nothing to do with lying. 

So yeah, I'd lean toward "maybe" they're not being fully truthful because of the blinking and gaze shifts, but it's really hard to say for sure. It could easily be them being anxious or just bad at interviews. I wouldn't bet money on it either way—I'd need more context to feel confident.

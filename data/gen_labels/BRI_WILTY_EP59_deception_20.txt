Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them possibly being deceptive, though I can't rule out nervousness entirely. The most noticeable thing is how they keep looking down while still trying to make eye contact—like they're glancing at the person they're talking to but then quickly dropping their gaze. That downward glance feels a bit off to me; I've noticed in other videos that people who are lying often avoid direct eye contact, even if they're trying to seem sincere. And they're raising their eyebrows a lot, which sometimes happens when someone's trying to seem surprised or innocent, but it can also be a nervous tic. 

But here's where I'm hesitating: it could just be them being really anxious or shy. Maybe they're not used to being recorded, or they're genuinely stressed about the topic, which would explain the gaze shifts and the eyebrow raises. The fact that they don't smile or fidget much makes it feel more like they're holding it together too carefully, but that could also mean they're just trying hard to stay calm. If they were telling the truth, the downward gaze might just be them thinking or being modest, and the raised eyebrows could be a genuine reaction to a question. 

I guess what tips me slightly toward deception is that the gaze down feels inconsistent with their effort to look at the person—they're not avoiding it completely, but it's not steady either. Like they're trying to seem engaged but can't quite pull it off. But honestly, it's not a clear-cut case. It's the kind of thing where I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation before I'd feel confident. So yeah, I'd say "maybe deceptive" based on the behavior, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's tricky because nonverbal cues can be so ambiguous, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. They're not smiling or laughing at all, which is interesting—sometimes people fake smiles when lying, but here they actually have a slight frown with their eyebrows raised, and their lips are pulled down with a bit of protrusion. That looks more like genuine frustration or discomfort than the forced positivity liars often try to pull off. They're also making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually leans toward truthfulness, though I know some skilled liars do that too to seem credible.

The frequent blinking stands out a bit—nervousness can cause that, but it could also just be them being tired or the lighting bothering their eyes. They're shaking their head "no" clearly at one point, which feels like a natural reaction to something they're denying, not something staged. And they never cover their mouth or fidget with their hands, which are common "tells" people associate with lying. The absence of awkward pauses or lip-curling (like a smirk) also feels like it’s not a rehearsed lie—they seem to be reacting in real time.

But I can see why someone might doubt it. The raised eyebrows and frowning could be interpreted as stress, which might come from lying, and the head shake feels a bit emphatic—like they're trying too hard to convince someone. I've seen people who are genuinely upset or defensive do similar things, though. The key thing for me is that their expressions don't match the classic "lie" profile: no fake smiles, no exaggerated gestures, no avoidance of eye contact. If they were lying, I'd expect more of a performance—like forcing a smile or looking away more. Instead, they seem like they're just upset or frustrated about whatever they're saying, which lines up with the truth being something they're uncomfortable with, not a fabrication.

So, yeah, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. Nervousness doesn't equal lying, and this feels more like someone being genuinely distressed than someone trying to hide something. It’s possible they’re lying and just good at it, but the cues I’m seeing don’t scream "deception" to me. It’s hard to say for sure without knowing the context, but based on what I’m watching, truth feels more likely.

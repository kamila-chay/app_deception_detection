Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The person is definitely scowling and frowning with their eyebrows, and their lips are pulled down—like they're genuinely frustrated or upset about something. But what stands out to me is that they're holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to and nodding along. I know a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact, so seeing them look right at the person while nodding feels a bit counterintuitive for someone lying. 

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Maybe the scowl is actually a mask—they're trying to seem angry to hide they're lying, right? Like, they're forcing a frown to seem sincere while they're actually nervous. And sometimes people get defensive when they're being truthful about something tough, so the scowl could just be them reacting to the conversation, not the lie itself. 

But the other thing is, they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" things—no blinking a lot, no touching their face, no fidgeting with their hands. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that, especially if they're stressed. The fact that they're just sitting there with that tight expression but staying calm and making eye contact... it feels more like they're upset about the *situation* rather than trying to hide something. Like, maybe they're explaining something they don't want to, but they're being honest about it. 

I guess I'm not totally sold, but the lack of those little "lie tells" and the steady gaze make me think it's more likely they're being truthful, even if they're not happy about it. It’s hard to say for sure though—people act different when they're stressed, and the scowl could mean a lot of things. But yeah, based on what I see, I’d guess truth over lie.

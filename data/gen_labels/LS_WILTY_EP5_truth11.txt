Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky without hearing what they're saying, but based on their body language alone... I'd lean toward them telling the truth, though I can't be 100% sure. 

What stands out is how engaged they seem. They're making consistent eye contact (gaze towards interlocutor), which usually goes against the idea of someone lying—they often avoid direct looks. Plus, they're smiling genuinely (lip corners up) and raising their eyebrows, which feels like natural reaction to what they're saying, not forced. The head tilting is interesting too—it often shows curiosity or active listening, not deception. And they're not doing any classic "lie signs" like frowning, frequent blinking, or covering their mouth. The downward gaze might make some people nervous (like they're avoiding truth), but since they're still looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, it feels more like they're thinking or being thoughtful than hiding something. 

But here's where I hesitate: the lips are protruded and retracted—like a slight pout or tension—and the chin moves up and down a lot. Some people might interpret that as nervous energy, which could mean they're lying but just doing a good job hiding it. Like, maybe they're rehearsed or really trying to seem calm. And the lip movements could be a subtle sign of stress, even if it's not obvious. I've seen people who lie well but still have tiny physical tells they don't control. 

Still, the overall vibe feels more like someone who's comfortable or even excited to share something. The smile isn't stiff, and they're not avoiding eye contact. If I had to guess without any context, I'd say truth—but I'd definitely want to hear what they're saying first. The behavior doesn't scream deception, but it's not a perfect "truth" signal either. It's just... normal, engaged human behavior. So yeah, I'd say probably truthful, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's one of those cases where the absence of red flags feels more telling than anything they're *doing*.

Hmm, this is actually a bit tricky to call just from the behavior alone. From what I can see in the clip, the person isn't doing anything that immediately screams "lying" to me—like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting. They're actually maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which often catches people off guard because we usually expect liars to look away. But then again, some people *do* stare more when lying to seem sincere, so that's not a sure thing.  

What stands out a bit more is that slight eyebrow raise they do a couple of times. It’s not dramatic or forced-looking, but it’s there—like they’re genuinely surprised or processing something. I’ve seen people raise their brows when they’re trying to remember details, which could go either way. If they were lying, I’d maybe expect more nervous tells, like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, but they’re not doing that. They’re just sitting there, making eye contact, and occasionally raising their eyebrows like they’re thinking hard.  

That said, it’s totally possible they’re a really good liar who doesn’t show stress cues, or maybe they’re just naturally expressive with their eyebrows. I’ve known people who do that all the time when they’re answering questions, even when they’re being honest. And honestly, without hearing what they’re saying or knowing the context—like if the question was super loaded—I’d be hesitant to jump to conclusions. The lack of other "deception markers" (no awkward pauses, no lip movements, no shifting around) makes me lean toward them being truthful, but it’s not definitive. It’s one of those cases where the absence of obvious signs might mean they’re telling the truth, or it might just mean they’re really composed.  

Honestly? I’d probably say "probably truthful" based on what I’m seeing, but I’d still want to hear the full conversation or check if they’ve been consistent with other details. It’s hard to say for sure just from body language alone—people are complicated. If I had to guess, I’d say the eyebrow thing feels more like genuine reaction than deception, but I’d definitely double-check if I could.

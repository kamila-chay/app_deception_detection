Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever's talking to them—gazing right at the interlocutor the whole time—and their eyebrows are raised, like they're genuinely surprised or processing something. That raised-brow thing makes me lean toward them being truthful because when people are lying, they often avoid eye contact or have more nervous tells like fidgeting or frowning, but here? Nothing like that. They're not smiling, not scowling, not blinking a lot—just sitting there with that slight eyebrow lift and direct gaze. It feels like they're actually listening and thinking about what's being said, not trying to cover something up.

But then I keep second-guessing myself. I know some people who lie really well and deliberately keep eye contact to seem credible, so maybe they're just good at it. And that raised eyebrow could technically be part of a rehearsed story—like they're "surprised" by the question to sound convincing. I've also heard that people sometimes look away when recalling memories truthfully, so the fact they're not looking away might *actually* be suspicious? Though honestly, that feels like a stretch here—their gaze is calm, not darting or forced. Plus, there's zero sign of stress: no lip biting, no hands moving, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* nervous habit, even if subtle. The absence of those tells makes me think they're not stressed about the question, which usually aligns with truthfulness.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing—no micro-expressions of deception, steady focus, and that natural-looking eyebrow raise—I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like the behavior of someone trying to hide something. But I won't claim I know for sure; it's easy to misread these things. Maybe it's just how they naturally react to questions. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'd want to see more context to be confident.

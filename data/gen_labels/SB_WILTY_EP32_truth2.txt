From what I'm seeing in the video, it's a bit tricky to pin down. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—which usually feels like a good sign for truth-telling—and they're nodding along, which seems like they're engaged and agreeing with what's being said. Their head is also turning slightly to the side a few times, but that just looks like natural conversation, not anything suspicious. I’d say those things lean toward them being honest.  

But then there’s the blinking—they’re doing it way more than usual, almost like they’re trying not to look at something, and they keep rubbing their hands and touching their head or neck. Those are classic signs people associate with nervousness, which *could* mean they’re lying, right? Like, if someone’s hiding something, they might fidget or avoid eye contact more. But here, they *are* making eye contact, so that’s confusing. Maybe they’re just naturally anxious, or maybe they’re in a high-pressure situation—like, I’ve seen people get super fidgety even when they’re telling the truth, especially if they’re on camera or feel judged.  

The hand movements and blinking might not even be about lying; it could just be them being expressive or stressed about the topic itself. And the fact that they’re looking down sometimes while still keeping their gaze on the person—it’s not like they’re avoiding eye contact entirely, which would be a bigger red flag for deception. Honestly, I’ve heard that people who lie often *overcompensate* with too much eye contact or nodding to seem credible, but this feels more relaxed.  

I’m not totally sure, though. It’s easy to jump to conclusions with these cues, and I don’t want to assume. Maybe they’re just a nervous person who happens to be telling the truth. I’d lean toward them being honest based on the eye contact and nodding, but I can’t rule out that the blinking and hand stuff might be a sign of something else entirely. Like, maybe they’re tired or just really thinking hard about what they’re saying. It’s a toss-up, but I’d say truth feels more likely than not.

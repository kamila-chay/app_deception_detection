Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, they seem really calm—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no nervous smiles or frowns. They're just sitting there with their head up and looking sideways, which might make someone think they're avoiding eye contact (and people often assume liars do that), but I've noticed in real life that people glance sideways all the time when they're just thinking or focusing on something else, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're checking a note or just have a habit of looking off to the side. The fact that they're not showing any classic stress signs—no lip biting, no shaky hands, no awkward pauses—makes me lean toward them being honest. Truth-tellers often seem relaxed, especially if they're just stating something straightforward.  

But then I keep thinking, "Wait, could this be a really good liar?" Some people are so practiced they don't even flinch when they're lying, so the lack of nervousness doesn't *prove* they're truthful—it just means they're not struggling to hide it. And that sideways gaze still nags at me a little; if they were lying, they might deliberately avoid direct eye contact, but it's equally possible they're just not looking at the camera for a neutral reason. I guess the key is that there's nothing *actively* deceptive here—no forced smiles, no over-the-top gestures, no signs of tension. It feels more like someone who's just being straightforward, even if they're not staring right at the person they're talking to.  

Honestly, I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Like, it's not a clear "aha, they're lying" moment, and the calmness tips the scale, but I can't rule out the possibility they're just really good at hiding it. If I had to guess based on what I see, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the full context first—sometimes the real clue is in what they're saying, not just how they're acting.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward this person being truthful, but honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from one clip. The way they're looking directly at whoever they're talking to—no shifting eyes or looking away—feels pretty consistent with someone being engaged and honest. And they're nodding along while they speak, which usually signals agreement or emphasis, like they're genuinely connecting with what they're saying. Plus, their eyebrows are raised a bit, which I've noticed people do when they're being earnest or trying to make a point clear, not when they're hiding something. 

But then again, I've seen so many examples where people fake that "truthful" body language to seem credible. Like, maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or they've been coached to keep eye contact and nod to seem trustworthy. I know some people even look directly at someone while lying to seem more convincing. And the fact that they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact *could* be a sign they're not nervous about lying, but it could also just mean they're comfortable speaking—like maybe they're used to giving presentations or talking to the camera. 

Honestly, the absence of obvious "lying signs" like fidgeting, avoiding gaze, or forced smiles is kind of telling, but it's not definitive. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear their tone to be sure. If this were a real-life situation, I'd probably say "I don't think they're lying," but I'd still be cautious because people are so good at faking calmness. Maybe it's just a naturally composed person who's being honest, but I can't rule out the other possibility entirely. It feels like it's probably truth based on what I'm seeing, but I'd hesitate to bet on it.

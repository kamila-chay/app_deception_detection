Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out based on what I'm seeing in the video, and it's a bit tricky. The person isn't making much eye contact—they're looking up or down a lot while they're speaking, not directly at whoever they're talking to. I didn't notice any obvious nervous habits either: no fidgeting, no exaggerated gestures, no lip-biting or weird blinking. They're just... calm, I guess? Like they're thinking about what to say, not trying to cover something up. That actually makes me lean toward them telling the truth, because when people are lying, they often do things like avoid eye contact *in a way that feels forced*—like darting their eyes or looking away too quickly. Here, it seems more like they're just focused on recalling something, which happens when people are being truthful about details.  

But then I keep thinking, "Wait, maybe they're really good at lying." I've heard some people can stay completely still and calm while lying, especially if they're practiced or not stressed about getting caught. Maybe they're just naturally quiet or reserved, and the gaze shifts are just how they talk, not a sign of deception. And honestly, eye contact norms vary so much—some cultures or personalities just don't look people in the eye when they're speaking, and that doesn't mean they're hiding anything.  

I also wonder if the video cuts off a key moment, but based on what I see, there's no obvious "tell" like a sudden smirk or a shaky voice. The absence of those things feels more like truth than deception, but I wouldn't say for sure. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect *some* micro-expression or shift in body language, but I don't see it. Still, I'm not 100% confident—lying can be subtle, and I'm not a trained lie detector. Honestly, I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to bet on it. It just feels... natural, not rehearsed. Like they're answering a question they've thought about before, not scrambling to make up a story. But yeah, it's hard to say without more context.

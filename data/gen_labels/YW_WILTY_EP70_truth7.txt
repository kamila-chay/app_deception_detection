From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty engaged while speaking—they're looking directly at the person they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor), nodding along like they're following the conversation, and occasionally glancing upward, which sometimes happens when people are thinking or recalling something. They also raised their eyebrows a couple of times, which feels natural, like they're processing what they're saying or reacting to a point. Those cues—eye contact, nodding, and the upward gaze—usually lean toward someone being truthful, at least in my experience. People often maintain better eye contact and use more natural gestures when they're not trying to hide something.

But I can see why it might be tricky. Raised eyebrows can sometimes signal hesitation or even deception, like they're trying to seem surprised or thoughtful to cover up. And that upward gaze? I've heard some say it means someone's lying, but honestly, I think it's way more likely they're just trying to remember details or think through their words, which happens when people are telling the truth too. The fact that they're not fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or doing anything like covering their mouth makes it feel less like they're hiding something. Still, it's not 100% clear—maybe they're just a calm person who naturally gestures like that. I'd lean toward them being truthful based on the lack of nervous tells, but I'm not going to swear on it. It feels like they're just speaking honestly, not trying to pull something.

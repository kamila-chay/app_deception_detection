Okay, so I watched the clip a couple times to be sure. The person is talking, and honestly, what stands out to me is that they're actually smiling while they speak—like, genuine lip corners up, not forced. They're also raising their eyebrows a bit, which seems like they're emphasizing something or maybe reacting to what they're saying. And their eyes are mostly looking down, not at the camera or the person they're talking to. 

Now, when I think about lying, I usually expect people to look away a lot or seem tense—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or having that "deer in headlights" stare. But here, they're smiling, which feels more like someone who's comfortable or even engaged. The raised eyebrows might just be them being expressive, not nervous. And looking down? I've heard that sometimes people look down when they're recalling a memory truthfully, like they're thinking, not trying to hide something. 

But... I can see why someone might question it. If they're lying, maybe they're trying *too hard* to seem calm and smile, so the smile feels off? Or maybe the down gaze is them avoiding accountability? I mean, I've seen people who lie look down a lot, so it's not impossible. And the eyebrows... sometimes people raise them when they're stressed, even if they're not lying. 

Still, the other signs are missing—no frowning, no weird blinking, no hands covering their face or anything. Those are the classic "I'm hiding something" cues, and they're not there. The behavior just seems... relaxed? Like they're just talking normally, not performing. 

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I see, it feels more like they're telling the truth. The smile and the lack of nervous tells lean that way, even though the down gaze is a little tricky. I’d say it’s probably truthful, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It’s just... the vibe doesn’t scream "liar" to me. If I had to guess, I’d lean truth, but I’m keeping an open mind because context matters—like, what are they even talking about? Still, based *just* on the body language, it doesn’t look like they’re lying.

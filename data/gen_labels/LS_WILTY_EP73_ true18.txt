Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out based on what I'm seeing in the video, and I'm not totally sure—I don't want to jump to conclusions. The person seems pretty calm while talking, which is interesting because when people lie, they often fidget or avoid eye contact, but here they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time. That feels natural, like they're engaged in the conversation, not trying to hide something. Their eyebrows are raised a bit too, which I've noticed before—when someone's being genuine and maybe surprised by what they're saying, they'll raise their eyebrows like that. It doesn't look forced or nervous, just... attentive.

But then I keep thinking, maybe that raised eyebrow could mean something else? Like, maybe they're skeptical about what they're saying, or trying to seem interested to cover up a lie. And yeah, some people who lie actually maintain eye contact to seem trustworthy, so that could be a red flag too. The thing is, they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" we hear about—no fake smiles, no frowning, no covering their mouth, no weird blinking. They're just talking normally, with their head steady and hands still. That feels less like someone rehearsing a story and more like they're just telling what happened.

I guess the part that leans me toward "truth" is how relaxed everything seems. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension—like maybe their jaw tightening or shifting in their seat—but they're just sitting there, nodding slightly (wait, no, they're not nodding, but they're not stiff either). The gaze toward the other person is the strongest clue; it looks like they're actually listening to the conversation, not just waiting for their turn to speak. But honestly, I can't be 100% sure. People lie in all sorts of ways, and some are really good at it without showing obvious signs. It just... feels like they're being honest based on what I see, but I'd want more context to be confident. Like, if I knew what they were talking about, it might help. For now, I'd lean toward truth, but I'm not ruling out the possibility they're just a really calm liar. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the situation.

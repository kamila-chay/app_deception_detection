Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, though I can't rule out deception entirely. The thing that stands out most is how steady their eye contact is—they're consistently looking right at the camera (what the description calls "gaze towards interlocutor"), which is actually a bit counterintuitive for someone lying. I've heard a lot about liars avoiding eye contact, but I know that's not always true, especially if they're practiced. Here, they're not darting their eyes away or looking down nervously, which would be more typical of someone faking it. Instead, they're holding that gaze, which feels more like someone being open.

But then there's that sideways glance—sometimes people glance sideways when they're thinking or recalling something, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just processing what they're saying, or it's a natural habit. The weird part is that they don't have *any* other "nervous" tells: no fidgeting, no weird smiles, no exaggerated expressions, no lip-biting or blinking. Truth-tellers often have those little natural quirks, but here it's almost too calm. That makes me wonder—could they be *too* calm? Like, maybe they're rehearsed and suppressing all signs, which would be a sign of deception. But honestly, that feels like a stretch. Most people who lie *do* show *some* subtle sign, even if it's not obvious, like a slight hesitation or a forced tone. Here, the delivery seems smooth, and the lack of those tells feels more like genuine composure than deception.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, maybe they're really good at it, or the situation isn't stressful enough to trigger nervousness. Or maybe the sideways glance is a red herring—it could just be them glancing at a note or something off-camera, not related to lying at all. I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking. Honestly, the more I watch, the less convinced I am they're lying. The direct eye contact paired with no other stress cues seems to outweigh the sideways look. But I'm not gonna swear on it—I'd need more context, like what they're actually saying, to feel confident. For now, I'd say it's probably truthful, but I'd be cautious about ruling out deception entirely. It's one of those cases where the absence of "tells" feels more telling than the one small thing that stands out.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, and honestly? It's a bit tricky. They're not doing any of the obvious "lie signs" people usually expect—no frowning, no nervous blinking, no avoiding eye contact. In fact, they're looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels like engagement. They also have their palms up, open-handed, and they're raising their eyebrows a bit with these exaggerated eye openings—like they're really trying to emphasize what they're saying. That kind of openness usually makes me lean toward them being honest, especially since they're not hiding anything with their hands or face.

But then I keep second-guessing myself. Sometimes when people are lying, they *overdo* the "truthful" gestures to seem extra convincing—like that eyebrow raise and eye opening could be a bit too deliberate. I've heard that people who are nervous might raise their eyebrows more, even if they're not lying. And palms up? I know some studies say it's a sign of sincerity, but I've also seen it used in fake sincerity before. Like, someone might consciously do it to seem trustworthy. Plus, the fact that they're not smiling or laughing at all—it feels a little stiff, which could mean they're trying too hard to be neutral, maybe to avoid giving away a lie.

Honestly, the most telling thing is the direct gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more often, but they're holding eye contact consistently. And the lack of micro-expressions—no scowling or lip movements that might betray stress—makes it feel genuine. But I can't be sure. Maybe they're just really practiced at not showing signs of lying, or maybe they're telling the truth and that's just their natural way of speaking. I guess what stands out most is the absence of red flags rather than the presence of "truth" cues. It feels like they're being straightforward, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. My gut says truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd be totally certain.

Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, it's a bit hard to say for sure. The person seems pretty calm overall—no big smiles or laughter, which you'd maybe expect if they were being really casual or trying to seem friendly. But they were definitely not smiling, and their mouth was closed a lot, with these little pauses where they just... stopped talking for a second. Like they were thinking hard about what to say next. 

What made me pause was the way they kept raising their eyebrows a bit—like, not super dramatic, but enough to catch your eye. And they had this little head tilt thing going on, like they were listening or processing something. I know people sometimes say raised eyebrows can mean skepticism or lying, but I've also seen friends do that when they're just genuinely surprised or trying to figure something out. Then there was the gaze down thing—they kept looking down, not at the camera or whoever they were talking to. That’s a common sign of discomfort, right? But honestly, I’ve seen a lot of people look down when they’re just thinking, not necessarily when they’re hiding something. Like, maybe they’re nervous about being on camera, or maybe they’re just not great at eye contact to begin with.

On the flip side, the lips were pulled back a little (retracted, I guess), and the corners were slightly up, which felt a bit... off? Like a forced smile or just a weird little expression when you’re trying to stay neutral. But then again, I’ve seen people do that when they’re trying to be polite or calm, not when they’re lying. And the awkward pauses—they weren’t long or weird, just natural-sounding breaks, like they were gathering their thoughts. If they were lying, I’d expect more fidgeting or more obvious tension, but they were pretty still otherwise. No hands rubbing, no covering their mouth, nothing like that. 

I guess the thing that leans me toward them telling the truth is that it just *felt* like they were being genuine, even if they were a little hesitant. Like, they weren’t trying too hard to seem convincing. If they were lying, I’d expect more of that "I’m trying to be smooth" energy, but this felt... real. Maybe it’s just me, though. Sometimes people are just quiet when they’re being honest, and sometimes they’re quiet when they’re lying. Hard to say for sure. I’d say it’s probably truth, but I’m not 100% sure—there’s just enough ambiguity that it could go either way. You know? Like, if I had to bet, I’d lean truth, but I’d want to see more context or maybe ask them directly.

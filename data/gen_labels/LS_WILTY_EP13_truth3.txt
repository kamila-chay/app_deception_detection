Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it’s a bit tricky to pin down whether they’re lying or not—truth-telling and lying can look really similar sometimes, especially with how people naturally react under pressure. They’re making steady eye contact with the person they’re talking to, which usually leans toward honesty because liars often avoid that. But they’re also blinking a lot, which some people associate with lying, though I’ve read that’s not a reliable sign—it could just mean they’re tired, nervous, or even just reacting to the lighting. Their eyebrows are raised a few times, which might look like they’re surprised or skeptical, but that’s not uncommon when someone’s processing a question, even if they’re being truthful. And they’ve got this slight frown (lip corners down), which could be from concentration or mild frustration, not necessarily deception. 

On the flip side, the head movements—tilting, side-turning, and shaking—seem pretty natural, like they’re engaged in the conversation rather than trying to hide something. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of defensiveness, like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting with their hands, or looking away a lot, but none of that’s happening here. The chin moving up a bit might look like they’re trying to seem confident, but it could just be a habitual gesture. Honestly, the lack of classic "lie cues" like gaze avoidance or hand movements makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I’m not completely sure. The frequent blinking and frown could still be stress from the situation, even if they’re telling the truth—maybe they’re just really invested in getting this right. Without knowing what they’re saying or the context, it’s hard to say for sure. But based on what I’m seeing, it feels more like they’re being genuine than deceptive, though I’d want more to go on before I’d be confident.

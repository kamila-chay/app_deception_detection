Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but watching the clip, I'm leaning a little toward them not being deceptive—though I can see why someone might think otherwise. The person seems pretty calm overall, and they're actually making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which feels like a sign they're engaged, not hiding something. But then there are a few things that make me pause: they're blinking way more than usual, like, almost constantly, and their chin is moving up and down a lot—kind of like they're doing this little nervous tic, maybe while thinking or trying to stay composed. Their head also keeps tilting sideways and shifting backward, which feels a bit off, like they're physically trying to create space or avoid something, but it's not super extreme.

On the other hand, I keep thinking, "Maybe they're just tired or stressed about something unrelated." Frequent blinking happens when people are tired, or even just in a room with dry air—it doesn't *have* to mean lying. The chin movements? I've seen people do that when they're concentrating hard, like trying to remember something, not necessarily when they're being dishonest. And the head tilting sideways? That's usually just a sign of curiosity or trying to process what's being said, not deception. Plus, they never look away completely—they're still gazing at the other person, just sometimes down at their lap, which could just be them gathering their thoughts. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance, like looking straight down or away for longer stretches.

The thing that makes me hesitate the most is that constant blinking and the chin thing—they feel like nervous habits, but habits can be tricky. Like, if someone's used to doing those things when they're stressed, it might not mean they're lying at all. I guess I'd want to hear the actual conversation to get context, because without that, it's hard to tell if those movements are tied to the content they're saying or just their natural behavior. Honestly, I'm split—part of me thinks it's just someone who's a little fidgety, and part of me wonders if that blinking is a red flag. But I'd probably go with "not lying" unless I saw more obvious signs like avoiding eye contact entirely or seeming overly rehearsed. It's just not screaming "deception" to me, even if it's a bit odd.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, but I'll try to walk through what I'm seeing. So, the person is speaking to someone, and their eyes are locked on the other person the whole time—that's actually a pretty strong sign they're being genuine, in my experience. Most people who are lying tend to avoid direct eye contact or glance away, so that makes me lean a little toward them telling the truth. 

Then there's the thing with their eyebrows—they're raised, not like a big, dramatic "what?" but just a subtle lift. I've seen that happen when people are genuinely surprised or trying to process something, not necessarily when they're hiding something. Like, if someone asks you a question you weren't expecting, you might raise your brows naturally. It doesn't *feel* like a "tell" to me, but I can see why someone might think it's suspicious—sometimes people do that when they're trying to seem innocent. 

Oh, and their palms are up, open, like they're showing their hands. That's usually a sign of openness or honesty, right? Like, "I'm not hiding anything." I've noticed that a lot in interviews—people with palms up tend to seem more relaxed. And honestly, they don't seem nervous at all: no fidgeting, no touching their face, no awkward pauses. Just calm, steady speech. 

But wait—I should also consider the other side. Maybe the eyebrow thing is a bit too intentional? Like, they're *trying* to look surprised to cover up a lie. And some people use palms-up as a fake "I'm truthful" gesture when they're actually lying. I mean, I've seen that happen. So it's not impossible they're deceiving us. The fact that they're maintaining eye contact *could* be a practiced tactic—some liars learn to do that to seem credible. 

Still, though... the lack of other signs really stands out. No blinking a lot, no frowning, no shifting around. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* nervous energy, even if it's subtle. But here, it just feels... calm. Like they're just answering a straightforward question. Maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question, which is why the brows went up. 

Honestly? I'm not 100% sure, but the evidence points more toward them being truthful than lying. The eye contact and open palms feel too consistent with honesty, and the absence of nervous tells is kind of a big deal. But I'm not going to say "definitely not lying"—it's hard to rule that out entirely. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it, but the video doesn't show the red flags I'd expect for deception. So yeah, I'd guess they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the context of the conversation to be sure.

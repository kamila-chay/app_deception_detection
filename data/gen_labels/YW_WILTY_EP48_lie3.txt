This is a bit challenging to assess just from the video, but I'll share my thoughts based on what I observe. The person maintains steady eye contact, which often suggests honesty since many people who lie tend to avoid direct gaze. That initially leans me toward them being truthful. Their eyebrows lift subtly, which can indicate genuine surprise or processing information, not necessarily deception. The open palms also typically signal openness and honesty, and they don’t display typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which adds to the impression of sincerity.

However, there are reasons to be cautious. The eyebrow raise might be a deliberate attempt to appear surprised and cover up deceit. Open palms, while usually a sign of honesty, can also be consciously used as a misleading gesture. Maintaining eye contact can be a practiced skill of deception to seem credible. Plus, the complete absence of any nervous cues might be suspicious too, because even skilled liars often reveal some subtle tells.

Taking these conflicting factors into account, I’m inclined to lean toward the possibility that the person might be lying. It’s not a definitive conclusion by any means, but some behaviors could be interpreted as calculated rather than spontaneous. Without more context, it’s hard to say for sure, but I find it plausible that the person is masking deceit rather than expressing genuine honesty.

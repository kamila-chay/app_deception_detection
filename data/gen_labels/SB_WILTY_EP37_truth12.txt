Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They’re making consistent eye contact with the person they’re talking to—gaze toward interlocutor is true—and their head movements feel natural, like they’re nodding slightly with their chin (up and down) while tilting their head and turning it sideways a bit, which often happens when someone’s listening or thinking carefully. There’s no fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no fake smiles or forced expressions—just steady, relaxed body language. That part makes me lean toward them being truthful because when people are lying, they often show more micro-expressions or tension, like avoiding eye contact, touching their face, or having exaggerated gestures. Here, they’re not doing any of that.  

But I can’t say for sure, of course. Maybe they’re just really good at hiding it—some people are so practiced at lying that they don’t show any of the classic signs. Or maybe the context matters: if they’re talking about something heavy, like a personal loss, looking down or tilting their head could just be them gathering their thoughts, not deception. I’ve seen people who are completely honest but still seem a little withdrawn in serious conversations. And honestly, the chin movements—up and down—could just be a natural habit, like how some people subtly adjust their jaw when they’re focused, not a sign of lying.  

Still, compared to what I’ve seen in other clips where people were clearly hiding something (like avoiding eye contact or over-gesturing), this feels more… straightforward. The absence of red flags makes me think they’re probably telling the truth, but I’d want to see more context to be certain. Like, is this a casual chat or a high-stakes interview? But based on the behavior alone, it seems like they’re being genuine. I’d say truth-leaning, but not 100% certain—just because people can be deceptive in quiet ways, even without obvious tells.

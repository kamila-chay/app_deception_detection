Okay, so I'm watching this video clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. The person seems pretty calm while talking—no obvious fidgeting, no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiles. They're actually making eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is interesting because sometimes when people lie, they avoid direct eye contact. But here, they're looking at the person most of the time, which feels like they're being engaged. Though, they do glance sideways a few times while talking, and their head turns a bit to the side too. I've seen people do that when they're thinking or just naturally gesturing, not necessarily because they're lying. Like, maybe they're recalling something or just not used to being on camera.  

Now, the thing that makes me lean toward truth is how *calm* they seem. There's no rapid blinking, no hands covering their mouth, no awkward pauses where they're clearly stalling. If they were making something up, I'd expect a little more nervous energy—like shifting in their seat or playing with their hair. But here, they're just speaking normally, with their head moving a bit but not in a way that screams "I'm hiding something." It's almost like they're just being straightforward.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it. That sideways glance *could* be a sign of discomfort, right? Like, if they're lying, they might look away to avoid the pressure of being watched. And the head turning side-to-side—sometimes that happens when people are rehearsing what they're about to say. But honestly, I've seen so many people do that while just talking casually, especially if they're not used to recording themselves. It doesn't *feel* like a classic "lie" signal to me.  

Also, the fact that they're maintaining eye contact most of the time really stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect them to avoid the gaze more consistently, not just glance sideways occasionally. Like, maybe if they were nervous about the topic, they'd look down or away more. But here, it's minimal and seems natural.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure—I'm just going by what I see. It's possible they're lying and just really good at hiding it, but I think the absence of those classic "liar" cues (like fidgeting, avoiding eyes, fake smiles) makes truth more likely. It feels like they're just being honest, not stressed or trying to cover up. But yeah, it's hard to say for sure without more context. I'd lean toward truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

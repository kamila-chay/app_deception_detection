Hmm, this is tricky. So I'm watching this person talk, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. At first glance, they seem a bit off—like when they're speaking, their lips are pulled back a little, almost like they're trying to hold back a grimace or something. It's not a smile, just a slight retraction, and they keep looking down while they talk, but they're still making eye contact with whoever they're speaking to, which is a bit confusing. That downward gaze often makes me think someone's hiding something, like they're avoiding looking you in the eye while they're lying, but I've also seen people do that when they're just really concentrating or thinking hard about what to say. 

Then there's the palms up thing—they're holding their hands open like they're being completely open and honest, which usually feels like a truth-telling sign, right? Like, "I'm not hiding anything." That kind of contradicts the other stuff. I mean, if they were lying, wouldn't they be fidgeting or covering their mouth or something? But they're not doing any of that—no blinking, no nervous gestures, just that weird lip thing and the downward gaze. 

But here's the thing: I've read that people can look down for all sorts of reasons—not just lying. Maybe they're just tired, or they're processing the question deeply, or maybe it's just their natural way of speaking. And that lip retraction? Could be a habit, or maybe they're just uncomfortable in the moment, not necessarily deceptive. I've definitely seen people do similar things when they're being truthful but stressed about the situation. 

On the flip side, the combination of the lips retracted (which feels forced, not natural) and the downward gaze while still engaging with the speaker—like they're avoiding eye contact *while* trying to appear engaged—does nudge me toward thinking they might be hiding something. But honestly, the palms up is throwing me off. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of anxiety, not that open-handed gesture. 

So yeah, I'm leaning a little toward deception just because of the lip thing and the gaze, but I'm really not confident. It could easily be just them being quiet or thoughtful. I'd need to see more of the context or hear the actual conversation to be sure. Right now, I'm just... not sure. It feels like they're trying to seem calm, but there's something off about the way their mouth moves. Still, I can't rule out that it's just them.

This is a bit complicated, but based on what I'm observing, I tend to lean toward the idea that this person might be less than truthful. Their lips pull back in a way that seems somewhat forced, almost like they're suppressing a grimace rather than genuinely smiling, which strikes me as unusual. The downward gaze they maintain while still holding some eye contact is also curious—it gives the impression of someone attempting to appear engaged while possibly avoiding direct connection, a behavior that can sometimes indicate someone is hiding something. 

At the same time, their open palms and lack of typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting or covering their mouth make the picture less clear. Usually, if someone were lying, you'd expect more overt signs of anxiety or discomfort, but here those are missing. That said, I’m aware that looking down and lip movements can be caused by many things, including concentration, fatigue, or just personal habits, making it hard to be certain this is deception. 

Taking all this into account, while I’m not fully convinced, the combination of the lip tension and avoiding full eye contact while trying to seem open makes me lean slightly toward thinking they might be hiding something. Still, without more context or information, I can’t be sure, but there does seem to be enough here to raise some doubt about their honesty.

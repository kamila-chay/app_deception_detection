Looking at this clip, while it's not entirely clear, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying. Their repeated eyebrow raising seems a bit exaggerated, almost as if they’re trying to appear more innocent or surprised than they genuinely are. Combined with the frequent head shaking and looking down, which can sometimes indicate someone denying something without direct eye contact, it gives off a sense of discomfort that often aligns with deception. Although they do maintain eye contact more than expected and don’t show some of the classic signs like fidgeting or excessive blinking, the mismatch between their facial expressions and gestures feels somewhat off—like they might be overcompensating to cover something up. It’s possible they’re just nervous or caught off guard, but overall, these cues suggest to me a higher chance that they’re not being entirely truthful. Still, without more context, I can’t be certain, but the signs here do nudge me toward suspicion rather than full trust.

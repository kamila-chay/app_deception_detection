Looking at this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tricky because body language can mean so many things depending on the situation. What stands out to me is how they keep raising their eyebrows—like, really noticeable, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem innocent. And they're shaking their head a lot while looking down, which sometimes feels like someone trying to deny something without making eye contact. I've seen people do that when they're nervous about answering a question, but it could also just be their natural way of reacting to being asked something they're not comfortable with.

But here's where I get stuck: they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" I've heard about, like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact completely, or blinking a ton. In fact, they're actually looking at the person talking to them most of the time, which makes me wonder if it's just a habitual thing—maybe they're just shy or used to nodding along while thinking. The head shaking could easily be a "no" they're saying out loud, not necessarily a lie. And looking down? That happens to me all the time when I'm trying to remember something, not just when I'm hiding something. I've even read that people who are being truthful might look down because they're concentrating, not because they're lying.

I guess the part that makes me lean slightly toward deception is the eyebrow-raising paired with the head shake—they feel a bit mismatched, like they're overcompensating. But honestly, I've seen so many videos where people do that and it's totally innocent. Maybe they're just stressed about the interview, or the question caught them off guard. Without knowing what they were asked or seeing their full context, it's really hard to say. I wouldn't call them a liar based on this alone, but I also wouldn't say they're definitely telling the truth. It feels like one of those moments where you're just guessing, and I'd need way more to go on before I'd feel confident either way. I'm not a lie detector, so I'll stick with "hard to tell" for now.

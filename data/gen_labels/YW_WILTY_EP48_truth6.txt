Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while speaking. They're looking directly at the camera the whole time—no shifting eyes or avoiding contact, which usually makes me think someone's being honest. They're also nodding along while they talk, like they're agreeing with their own words or confirming what they're saying, and that feels natural, not forced. I don't see any of the usual signs I'd expect if someone was lying: no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words, and no tense body language like crossed arms or covering their mouth. Their face is pretty neutral too—no fake smiles or scowls, just a calm expression.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. Raising eyebrows can sometimes happen when someone's trying to seem surprised or skeptical, even if they're telling the truth—maybe they're reacting to a question they weren't expecting. And it's possible they've practiced speaking calmly to avoid looking nervous, so the lack of "tells" might just mean they're good at hiding it. But honestly, the direct eye contact and the nodding feel like stronger indicators of truthfulness than the eyebrow thing. Liars usually look away or seem tense, but this person seems relaxed and engaged.  

Still, it's hard to say for sure without hearing the context of what they're saying. If they're describing something really emotional or personal, the lack of visible emotion might stand out, but the video doesn't show that. Right now, all I can go by is what I see: no nervous habits, steady gaze, and natural agreement through nodding. So I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It just feels like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying.

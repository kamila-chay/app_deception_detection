Honestly, it's a bit hard to say for sure just from watching, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I'm not 100% certain. The way they kept making eye contact with the person they were talking to (that "gaze towards interlocutor" detail) feels like something a liar might avoid, so that gives me pause. And they were actually leaning in a bit with their head moving forward, which usually suggests engagement or sincerity, not trying to create distance like someone might do when lying.  

But then there's the frequent blinking and eyebrows raised—those can sometimes signal stress or deception, right? Like, if they're nervous about what they're saying. I've seen people do that when they're trying to remember a story or feel uneasy. Still, the fact they weren't avoiding eye contact or fidgeting with their hands (no rubbing, scratching, or covering their face) makes me think the stress might just be from being on camera, not from hiding something.  

Also, they didn't have that "awkward pause" mouth thing or any obvious signs of forced smiles or frowns—those often pop up when someone's trying too hard to seem natural while lying. Here, it felt more like they were just... talking, with some natural nervous energy. The sideways glance might be a bit odd, but people look away when thinking, not necessarily when lying.  

I guess the counterargument is that some liars are really good at faking eye contact or keeping their body still, so those cues alone aren't foolproof. But overall, the combination of direct gaze, leaning in, and no other "tells" makes it feel more like they're being genuine than deceptive. I'd say truth, but honestly? I'd want to hear the context or see more of the conversation before I'd be totally sure. It's just that the cues I'm seeing don't scream "lying" to me.

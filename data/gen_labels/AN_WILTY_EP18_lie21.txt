Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful. The first thing that stands out is how they're holding eye contact—they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually makes me think they're being honest, since people often avoid eye contact when lying. But then there's this really noticeable scowl and those frowning eyebrows—they're not just neutral, they're actively tense. And the head shaking? That feels like a strong "no" or "I disagree," which in my experience often happens when someone's trying to deny something they're actually guilty of. The lip corners are pulled down too, like they're frustrated or upset about the question itself, which might mean they're stressed about the lie.

But here's where I hesitate—I could totally be wrong. Maybe they're just genuinely annoyed by the question, like if someone asked them something really personal or unfair, and that's why they're scowling and shaking their head. Head shaking can be a habit for some people, not necessarily a lie. And the fact that they're not fidgeting, not covering their mouth, not blinking a lot—all those usually point to truth-telling. So it's tricky: the eye contact and lack of nervous gestures suggest honesty, but the negative expressions and head movement scream discomfort. If I had to guess, I'd say the negative cues are stronger here, but I'm not confident at all. It feels like they might be lying about something specific, but I'd want to see more context—like what the question was—to be sure. Honestly, it's one of those cases where it's hard to tell without knowing the whole conversation.

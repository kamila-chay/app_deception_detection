Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive, but I'm not entirely sure—there are a few things that stand out, but also some things that could just be normal behavior. They're not smiling or laughing at all, which sometimes happens when people are trying to hide something, but I know some people just don't laugh in serious conversations, so that alone doesn't mean much. What caught my attention was how often they're raising their eyebrows and tilting their head—those are kind of nervous ticks, right? Like when someone's trying to seem interested but is actually stressed. And the sideways glance while they're talking... I've heard that people often look away when lying, but I've also seen people do that when they're just thinking or not sure how to phrase something.  

Then there's the shrug at the end—it feels a bit too casual for the situation, like they're trying to wave off the question instead of answering directly. But wait, shrugs can just be a way to say "I don't know" without lying. And they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels more honest, not less. If they were lying, I'd expect them to avoid eye contact more. So maybe the sideways glance is just them shifting position, not deception.  

Honestly, it's hard to tell without knowing the context—like, what are they even talking about? If it's a high-stakes question, the nervous ticks might mean something. But if it's just a casual chat, it could be nothing. The head tilting and raised eyebrows feel like signs of uncertainty, which *could* mean they're not being truthful, but it could also just mean they're genuinely confused or processing what they're saying. I'd lean toward "maybe deception" because of the combination of the sideways gaze, the shrug, and the lack of natural expressions, but I wouldn't bet on it. There's too much room for misinterpretation. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *more likely* they're not telling the whole truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd be confident.

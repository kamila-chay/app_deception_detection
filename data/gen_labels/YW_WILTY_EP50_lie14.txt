Based on what I’m observing in the video, I’m inclined to think they might be deceptive, though I can’t say for certain. The absence of any genuine smiling or laughter strikes me as unusual; while some people don’t laugh in serious conversations, the complete lack of natural expression could suggest they’re trying to hide something. The frequent eyebrow raises and head tilts come across as nervous ticks, which often indicate stress or discomfort—common signs when someone is attempting to conceal the truth. The sideways glance during their speech also raises suspicion; although people sometimes look away when thinking, it’s also a behavior commonly associated with lying. 

The shrug at the end seems almost dismissive, as if they want to avoid directly addressing the question, which feels somewhat off. While shrugs can mean uncertainty or “I don’t know,” in this context it leans toward evasion. Moreover, their usual eye contact could be a deliberate attempt to appear honest, since someone lying might expect to avoid eye contact. Combining these factors—the lack of natural expression, nervous gestures, sideways glance, and the shrug—it seems more likely they’re not being entirely truthful. Without more context, it’s hard to be definitive, but overall I lean towards thinking they’re probably deceptive, even though it’s not absolutely clear.

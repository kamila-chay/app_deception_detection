Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to—which usually feels like a good sign for truthfulness, since liars often avoid that. And their arms are open, which seems relaxed and welcoming, not closed-off or defensive like you'd expect if they were hiding something. That part makes me lean toward them being honest.  

But then there's the frequent blinking—they're doing it a lot, almost like they're nervous. I've heard that excessive blinking can sometimes be a sign of stress or lying, so that throws me off a little. I wonder if they're just tired, or maybe the lighting is bothering their eyes? It's hard to tell without more context. Their head is also moving backward a bit, like they're pulling away slightly, which could feel like discomfort—but it might just be a natural gesture, like shifting in their seat, not necessarily deception.  

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the classic "lying cues" I've read about: no frowning, no fake smiles, no covering their mouth, no head shaking. Their expression is pretty neutral, which actually feels more like someone being calm and straightforward. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be more guarded or try to overcompensate with gestures.  

Still, I can't rule out the blinking entirely. Maybe they're just really focused on what they're saying, and the blinking is unrelated. Or maybe they're genuinely nervous about the topic, even if they're telling the truth. I keep going back to the open arms and steady eye contact—they feel more consistent with honesty than the blinking does. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's not a clear-cut case, and without knowing the situation, it's easy to second-guess. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'd also be ready to be wrong. It's one of those things where the behavior *looks* honest, but you can't always trust your gut on this stuff.

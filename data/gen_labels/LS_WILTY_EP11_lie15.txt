Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. On one hand, the person seems pretty composed—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, and they're actually keeping eye contact with whoever they're talking to. Their arms are open, which usually reads as relaxed or engaged, not defensive. The head tilting and slight backward movement of the head... I've seen people do that when they're thinking or trying to seem thoughtful, not necessarily when they're lying. The chin moving up a bit feels natural, like they're trying to emphasize something.

But then, I keep wondering if they're *too* calm. Sometimes really good liars don't show the obvious nervous stuff—like the blinking or frowning we often associate with deception. Maybe they're just really practiced at staying cool under pressure. The head moving back could even be a subtle sign of discomfort, like they're mentally stepping away from the lie, but it's so slight I'm not sure. And yeah, the arms open is definitely more "truthful" than "deceptive" in most contexts I've seen. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be more closed off—arms crossed, maybe avoiding eye contact.

Still, I can't rule it out entirely. Maybe the calmness *is* the deception, like they're trying to seem too relaxed to hide the lie. But honestly, the absence of the classic signs (like micro-expressions or nervous tics) makes me lean toward them being truthful. It feels more like someone who's just a bit thoughtful or hesitant, not someone actively hiding something. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure, though—body language alone isn't always the whole story. I'm not 100% confident, but based on what I see, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth. But I'd definitely be cautious—lying is complicated, and people can be really good at faking calm.

Honestly, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure it out, but it's a bit tricky. The person seems a bit tense—like they're not completely relaxed. I notice their eyebrows are raised a lot, which sometimes happens when someone's trying to seem surprised or innocent, but it could also just be them reacting to the question. Then there's that frown and their lips pulled down, which feels like they're genuinely unhappy or uncomfortable about whatever they're saying. That's a bit of a red flag for me because when people are being truthful about something stressful, they might still look upset, but the combination with the raised eyebrows makes me wonder if it's forced.

The way they're looking down a lot instead of meeting the camera's gaze also stands out. I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I know that's not always true—some people just naturally look away when they're thinking or feel awkward. Still, paired with the downturned mouth, it feels like they're not fully engaged in the conversation, like they're holding something back. And their arms are open, which usually suggests openness, but in this context, it almost feels like they're trying too hard to seem approachable while they're actually nervous.

On the flip side, though, I can't rule out that they're just genuinely upset about the situation. Maybe they're recalling something painful or stressful, and the frown and gaze down are just from that emotion, not deception. The raised eyebrows could be from surprise at the question itself, not from lying. And honestly, I've seen people look this way when they're being truthful but uncomfortable—like when they're trying not to cry or feel embarrassed. 

I'm leaning toward deception because of the mix of tension cues (frown, downturned lips, avoiding gaze), but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to misread body language, especially without knowing the context. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're really stressed about the topic. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's more likely they're not being fully honest, but I'd want more context to be confident. It's not a clear-cut case, though—I'd hesitate to say "definitely lying" without more to go on.

This is a bit challenging, but as I watch the clip, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying. They do maintain consistent eye contact and nod along, which generally suggests truthfulness, as liars often avoid eye contact. They also don't show obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or excessive blinking. However, the subtle cues such as the downturned lip corner and the slight upward chin movement catch my attention. These could indicate stress or an attempt to hold back emotion, which sometimes happens when someone is being deceptive. The head turning to the side could also suggest they’re processing information or trying to manage their response, which isn't a typical relaxed posture.

While the absence of classic deception signs like gaze aversion or forced smiles makes it harder to be sure, these subtle tension signals make me wonder if the calm composure is a kind of mask. Skilled liars often suppress the more obvious tells, so the consistent eye contact and nodding might be deliberate. I’m not fully convinced they’re being truthful; rather, these nuanced behaviors suggest they might be trying to appear honest while hiding something. Overall, I lean toward thinking they could be deceptive, even if it’s not entirely clear-cut.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip now, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty composed overall—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like it might point toward truthfulness since liars often avoid that. They're also nodding along, which usually signals agreement or engagement, not deception. And they don't seem to be fidgeting or doing anything nervous like touching their face or blinking a lot. 

But then there's that downturned lip corner, and the chin moving upward a bit. I've heard that sometimes when people are stressed or trying to hold back emotion, their mouth might pull down like that, or their chin might lift slightly—like they're bracing themselves. It could be them being genuinely upset about what they're saying, not necessarily lying. The head side-turning too feels more like they're thinking or processing, not like a classic "liar's" shift. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic signs—like avoiding eye contact or looking away a lot—but they're not doing that. The fact that they're maintaining gaze and nodding feels pretty consistent with someone being honest. Maybe they're just uncomfortable in the situation, which could explain the downturned lips and chin movement without it meaning deception. I keep wondering if the chin thing is a red herring though. Some people do that when they're concentrating, not lying. 

Honestly, the absence of the usual "deception tells" (no fidgeting, no forced smiles, no gaze aversion) makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I'm not 100% confident because sometimes skilled liars suppress those cues. Still, given what I'm seeing—steady eye contact, natural nodding, no obvious nervousness—I'd probably guess they're telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like deception to me, even if it's hard to say for sure. Maybe I'm missing something, but based on the behavior alone, it seems more like they're just being earnest, even if they're a little tense.

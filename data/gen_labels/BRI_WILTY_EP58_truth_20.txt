Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how consistently they're making eye contact—they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, and they even glance down a couple of times like they're thinking or recalling something. That feels natural to me, not like someone who's trying to avoid looking guilty. They're also smiling a bit, which seems genuine—not forced or over-the-top—and they're not fidgeting at all, like scratching their face or rubbing their hands. Those little nervous habits usually show up more when people are lying, so their calmness makes me think they're not hiding anything.

But honestly, I can't be 100% sure. Sometimes people smile when they're lying to seem friendly or to cover up, especially if they're trying to be convincing. And the way they're shifting their gaze—up and down—could just be part of how they naturally talk, not necessarily a sign of truth. I've seen people who lie really well without showing any of those obvious stress signs, so it's possible they're just good at controlling their body language. It's also tricky because the video doesn't show the actual content of what they're saying—I'd want to hear the words to really judge if it lines up with what they're doing. 

All things considered, though, the steady eye contact and lack of nervous energy make me think they're probably being honest. It just feels like they're comfortable and engaged in the conversation, not like they're rehearsing or trying to trick anyone. But yeah, I'd hesitate to say it's definite—body language alone can be tricky. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd be totally confident.

Hmm, this is tricky. From what I can see in the video, the person isn't doing any of the obvious "lie signs" people usually point to—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that stiff, forced smile. They're actually tilting their head a bit, which seems kind of curious or thoughtful, not nervous. And they've got their palms facing up, which usually reads as open or non-threatening. I've seen a lot of videos where people who are lying *do* try to look calm and "honest," so that part makes me pause. Like, maybe they're trying too hard to seem genuine, which could be a red flag. But then again, I've also seen people tilt their heads naturally when they're just listening carefully or trying to understand something, and palms up isn't always deceptive—it's often how people show they're being straightforward.  

The thing is, they're not doing *anything* that screams "deception" either. No exaggerated blinking, no lip biting, no shifting around. If they were lying, I'd expect at least some small sign of discomfort, but here it's all... quiet. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe they're actually telling the truth and the situation is just making them thoughtful. I mean, I've been in interviews where I felt nervous but didn't show it, and I wasn't lying. Or maybe the head tilt is just a habit—they do it all the time.  

Honestly, I'm not sure. The absence of classic signs doesn't prove they're truthful, but it also doesn't prove they're lying. It feels like maybe they're just a calm person in a situation where they're being honest. But I'd need way more context—like what they're talking about or how they're reacting to specific questions—to feel confident. Without that, I'd lean toward "probably not lying," but I'd be really hesitant to say it outright. It's easy to misread these things, especially when someone's not doing the obvious "tells." I'd want to see the full conversation first before I'd even feel comfortable guessing.

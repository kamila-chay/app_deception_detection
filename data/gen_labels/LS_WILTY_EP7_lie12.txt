Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching this person, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. On one hand, there are a few things that stand out that make me wonder if they might be uncomfortable or not being fully open. They're raising their eyebrows a lot, which often feels like a sign of surprise or maybe even a little tension when someone's trying to hold something back. Their eyes are darting sideways quite a bit instead of staying steady, and they're doing this frequent blinking thing that I've noticed before when people are stressed or trying to think of what to say next. They've got their arms folded pretty tight across their chest, and their hands are scratching their head and touching their face a lot—like they're fidgeting. Plus, they're covering their mouth with their hand at one point, which feels like a defensive move, almost like they're trying to hold something in.

But then... I keep thinking, *could this just be them being naturally nervous or expressive?* I mean, everyone blinks a lot sometimes, especially if they're in a bright room or just tired. That sideways gaze might just be how they look when they're thinking, not necessarily avoiding eye contact to lie. The arms folded thing? That's super common—people do that when they're just trying to feel a bit more secure, not necessarily hiding something. And the lip corners up and lips protruded... it looks like they might be trying to smile or look neutral, but it doesn't feel like a full smile. It could just be them forcing a calm expression because they're aware they're on camera, not because they're lying. I've seen people do that all the time when they're just trying to seem relaxed.

The hands covering their mouth and the scratching... yeah, those are the parts that stick out most. But honestly, I've known people who scratch their head constantly when they're just thinking hard about a question, not when they're being deceptive. And covering the mouth? Could be a yawn, or maybe they just have a habit. Without knowing what they're being asked or the context of the conversation, it's really hard to tell if these are signs of deception or just someone who's a bit anxious in general. I'd be hesitant to say for sure they're lying, but I also wouldn't rule it out completely. It feels like the kind of thing where the *way* they're reacting might be a clue, but it could easily be explained by something else. I'd want to see more of the conversation or maybe hear their actual words before I'd feel confident either way. Right now, it's leaning a little toward "maybe," but I'm not convinced.

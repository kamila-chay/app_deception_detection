Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the behavior in the video. I'm watching someone answer a question, and honestly, their body language doesn't scream "liar" to me. They're actually holding steady eye contact with the person asking the question (gaze towards interlocutor), which is often a sign of honesty, though I know that's not a rule. They don't seem fidgety at all – no hands rubbing, scratching, or obvious nervous tics like lip biting or frequent blinking. That absence of nervous energy feels a bit reassuring, like they're not trying to hide something through physical movement.

But then there's that raised eyebrow thing. It shows up in the data, and it's a bit confusing. Raised eyebrows can mean surprise, skepticism, or even just emphasis, not necessarily lying. Maybe they were genuinely surprised by the question, or maybe they're trying to process it carefully. It's hard to tell if it's a sign of deception here. And they do look down occasionally (gaze down), which some people associate with lying, but I've heard that's actually really common when people are thinking hard or recalling details – which truth-tellers do too. So that down-gaze might just mean they're concentrating, not avoiding the truth.

On the flip side, the lack of *any* classic "lie" signals is striking. No forced smiles, no fake laughter, no scowling, no awkward mouth movements. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a few of those micro-expressions or nervous habits to pop up, especially under pressure. The fact that they're mostly calm and composed, even with that one raised eyebrow, makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I can't rule out that the raised eyebrow *is* a sign of nervousness masking a lie, even if it's subtle. It's possible they're just really good at controlling themselves otherwise.

Honestly, without knowing the context of the question or what they're saying, it's really hard to be sure. The behavior seems neutral to slightly positive for truthfulness, but it's not definitive. I'd say it *feels* like they're telling the truth based on what I see – the steady eye contact, no fidgeting, and the absence of obvious deception cues – but I'm not 100% confident. It could be that the raised eyebrow is a red herring, or maybe they're just naturally expressive. If I had to guess right now, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want more context before I'd feel really solid about it. It's easy to misread these things, so I'm not going to claim I know for sure.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly? It's tricky because body language isn't foolproof, but here's what stands out to me. They're keeping direct eye contact the whole time—gazing right at whoever they're talking to, no looking away or down like I've seen people do when they're nervous or making something up. That feels like a strong sign they're being open, but I know some people practice that for lies too, so I'm not jumping to conclusions yet.

Then there's the way they're holding their arms—completely open, not crossed or folded, and not fidgeting with their hands at all. I've read that crossed arms or hiding hands can signal defensiveness, but this feels relaxed and welcoming, like they're trying to connect. Their eyebrows are raised a bit too, which usually shows surprise or engagement, not the tension I'd expect if they were lying. And they're not smiling or laughing, which is interesting—some liars force smiles, but the absence of that feels... natural? Like they're just calmly sharing something.

But here's where I hesitate: I've also heard that very practiced liars can mimic all this—like they'll look you straight in the eye and keep their arms open to seem trustworthy. Maybe they rehearsed this part. And the lack of any nervous ticks (no blinking, no lip biting, no shifting in their seat) could just mean they're good at controlling themselves, not that they're telling the truth. Like, someone who's used to lying might not even *feel* nervous about it.

Still, the combination of steady eye contact, open posture, and that subtle raised-brow expression—without any of the classic "lie signals" like fidgeting or avoiding gaze—makes me lean toward them being truthful. It just feels less *effortful* than a lie would be. But I'd want to hear more context—what are they even talking about?—because sometimes people get really calm when they're lying about something they've thought through a lot. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video alone, it seems more likely they're telling the truth than not. It’s not a slam dunk, but it’s the most consistent thing I’ve seen.

Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm and steady while speaking—they're maintaining consistent eye contact with the camera, which feels like they're engaging directly rather than avoiding it. There's no fidgeting, no nervous gestures like rubbing hands or touching their face, and their mouth stays closed without any awkward pauses. They're not smiling or scowling either, which is interesting—some people might fake a smile when lying, but they're just... neutral. That makes me lean toward them being truthful because the absence of classic "lie cues" (like frequent blinking or lip biting) usually points to honesty in these situations.  

But honestly, I'm not 100% sure. I mean, some really practiced liars can stay completely still and make eye contact without flinching—they might even *over*-control their expressions to seem calm. Like, maybe they rehearsed this part and it's not genuine. Also, the lack of any emotional reaction (no smile, no frown) could just mean they're not excited about the topic, not that they're lying. Some people are just naturally low-key, even when telling the truth.  

I guess the thing that sticks with me is how smooth their speech feels—they're not hesitating or stumbling, which often happens when someone's making things up. But then again, if they're lying *and* confident, they might sound just as smooth. It’s tricky. I’d probably say "truth" based on what I’m seeing, but I’d still wonder if they’re just a really good actor. Like, I wouldn’t bet my life on it, but the video doesn’t show anything that screams "lying" to me. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth, but I’d want to hear more context before I’d feel completely sure.

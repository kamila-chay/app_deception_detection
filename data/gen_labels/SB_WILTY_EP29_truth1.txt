Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video, but I'll try to walk through what I'm seeing. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous blinking. They're actually smiling, and it looks kind of natural—not forced or exaggerated. I notice their lips are pulled up at the corners (which feels genuine), but also slightly down? Wait, that part's a bit confusing at first glance. But when I watch again, it’s like a soft, real smile where the mouth curves up but the lower lip might be relaxed or even slightly downturned in a way that happens when people are just being friendly, not faking it. 

Their eyes are focused on whoever they're talking to—gaze toward the interlocutor—so they're not avoiding contact, which usually happens when someone's lying. And they're tilting their head a bit, which feels like they're engaged, listening, or just being curious, not hiding anything. No big eye rolls or fake laughter either, which is a relief. If they were making it up, I'd expect more signs of tension—like touching their face, shifting around, or looking away a lot. But here, they're just... sitting there, smiling, looking at the person, head tilted. 

That said, I can't be 100% sure. Some people just naturally smile with their lips like that, or tilt their head as a habit—maybe they're just a friendly person. And it's possible they're lying *really* well, without showing any physical tells. I've seen that happen before; not everyone fidgets when they're not telling the truth. But honestly, the lack of red flags—no awkward pauses, no raised eyebrows, no lip biting or covering the mouth—makes me lean toward them being truthful. It just feels... easy. Like they're not struggling to keep up a story. 

Still, I'd hesitate to say "definitely truth" because human behavior is messy. Maybe they're just good at hiding it, or maybe the situation is just low-stakes for them. But based on what I'm seeing, the calmness and natural engagement seem to line up more with honesty than deception. I'd say truth, but I'm not sweating it—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

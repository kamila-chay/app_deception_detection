Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky without knowing the context, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth based on what I see. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which feels natural—not like they're avoiding it, which sometimes happens when people are lying. They're also nodding along while listening, which usually shows they're engaged and processing what's being said, not just trying to stall or fake agreement. And that one moment where they raise their eyebrows? It doesn't look forced or nervous—it seems like a genuine reaction to something they're hearing, like surprise or curiosity, which fits with someone being honest.  

But I can see why someone might question it too. Sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're stressed or trying to think of a lie, and nodding can be overdone even when someone's being deceptive. I've seen people do that in interviews—like they're trying too hard to seem cooperative. And while they don't seem fidgety or avoid eye contact, the absence of other "truth" markers (like a relaxed smile or natural pauses) makes me wonder if it's just them being quiet or reserved, not necessarily lying.  

Still, the combination of steady eye contact, natural nods, and that subtle eyebrow raise feels more aligned with someone being truthful than deceptive. It doesn't scream "lying" to me, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it either. It just seems like they're listening and reacting in a way that's consistent with someone who's being genuine. Maybe it's just them being a calm, attentive person. I'd say truth is more likely, but I'm not 100% sure—there's always room for doubt.

Looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how they keep their gaze down the whole time—like they're focused on the ground or their hands, not looking at whoever's talking to them. Now, I know some people say avoiding eye contact is a sign of lying, but honestly, I've seen way too many people look down when they're just thinking hard or feeling a bit shy, not necessarily hiding something. Like, maybe they're just processing what's being said or trying to stay calm. 

What makes me think it might be truth is that they don't seem nervous at all. No fidgeting, no weird smiles, no blinking like they're stressed—I mean, the video's super calm in that way. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a little more tense, right? Like, maybe shifting in their seat or touching their face. But here, they're just... still. And the lack of those little tells—no raised eyebrows or awkward pauses—feels more like someone who's just being straightforward. 

But yeah, I can't rule out lying completely. Maybe they're really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not lying about this specific thing but still feeling uneasy for another reason. Like, maybe they're just tired or distracted, and that's why they're looking down. I've definitely had moments where I zone out and don't make eye contact, and no one would call me a liar for it. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up, but the absence of obvious stress signals makes me think they're probably being honest here. Still, I'd want to see more context to be sure—like, what are they even talking about? But based on what I'm seeing in the clip alone? I'd guess truth, but I'm not 100% locked in on that. It just feels... quieter, like they're not trying to hide anything.

Okay, so I watched the clip a couple times trying to figure this out. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what I saw. The person was talking to someone, and they kept raising their eyebrows a lot—like, not just once, but pretty frequently while they were speaking. Their eyes were also blinking more than usual, which made me pause because I've heard that can sometimes be a sign of stress or trying to think of something. But then they kept looking right at the person they were talking to, and their hands were open with palms up, which usually feels like an honest, open gesture to me. They also had this head tilt thing going on, like they were really listening or thinking about what they were saying.

On the one hand, the raised eyebrows and frequent blinking *do* make me wonder if they're nervous—maybe they're lying and trying to cover it up. Sometimes people do that when they're fabricating something. But then, the direct eye contact and the palms up? Those feel like they're trying to seem trustworthy, not deceptive. Like, if someone's lying, they often avoid eye contact or cross their arms, but here they're leaning in, looking at the person, and keeping their hands open. The head tilt also seemed engaged, not like someone who's hiding something. 

I also noticed they weren't frowning or scowling, which I sometimes associate with discomfort when lying. And the way they were gesturing—just the head tilt and the open palms—felt natural, not forced. Like, they weren't overdoing it to seem innocent. The "gaze up" part is interesting too; people often look up when recalling memories, which could mean they're telling the truth about something they actually remember. But I guess liars might do that too to "think up" a story. Still, the combination of the open hands, direct gaze, and no other nervous ticks (like fidgeting or covering their mouth) makes me lean more toward them being truthful. 

That said, I'm not ruling out lying entirely. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe the blinking was just because of the lighting. It's hard to say for sure from just a video. But based on what I saw, the openness of their body language seems to outweigh the eyebrow thing. I'd probably guess they're telling the truth, but I'd still want to see more context before I'd be completely certain. It just didn't *feel* like the nervous energy I'd expect if they were lying.

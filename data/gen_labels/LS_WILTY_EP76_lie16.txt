Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. They maintain steady eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, but that constant eyebrow raise throughout feels off—it could be a sign of forced sincerity rather than genuine surprise or skepticism. The way they lean their head forward seems a bit exaggerated, almost like they're trying too hard to appear engaged and earnest, which can be a subtle attempt to convince or distract.

Although they’re not fidgeting or blinking excessively, behaviors that often indicate lying, some skilled deceivers manage to stay very still. The mixed signals here—the strong eye contact paired with the raised eyebrows and exaggerated head movement—make me suspect there might be some degree of deception. It’s not clear-cut, and they could simply be expressive or anxious, but overall, the cues nudge me more toward thinking they’re probably not telling the full truth.

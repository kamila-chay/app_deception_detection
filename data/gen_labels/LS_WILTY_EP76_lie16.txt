Hmm, I'm watching this clip and honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. The person is looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—that usually makes me think they're being truthful, since liars often avoid eye contact. But then there's this thing with their eyebrows being raised the whole time, like they're genuinely surprised or skeptical about what they're saying. That's confusing because sometimes people do that when they're being honest and processing something, but other times it can feel like they're trying to seem extra sincere to cover up a lie.  

Also, they keep leaning their head forward a bit while talking, which feels a bit... over-enthusiastic? Like they're trying to seem engaged or earnest, but it doesn't quite match the calmness of the rest of their body. They're not fidgeting or blinking a lot, which usually makes me lean toward truth, but then again, some people who lie are really good at staying still.  

I keep going back and forth: if they were telling the truth, why the raised eyebrows? Maybe they're actually reacting to the question, like it caught them off guard. But if they're lying, the head lean and the eyebrows could be subtle tells—they're trying too hard to seem credible. Still, there's nothing obviously "off" like avoiding eye contact or nervous gestures, which makes me wonder if it's just them being naturally expressive.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The eye contact is strong for truth, but the other bits... I'd say it's probably not a clear lie, but it's not 100% solid truth either. Maybe they're just a bit anxious about the topic, and the behavior is just them being themselves. I'd lean toward truth, but I'd definitely double-check if I could. It's one of those cases where it's hard to tell without more context.

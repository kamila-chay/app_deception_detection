From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty calm and open in their posture—like they're not hiding anything physically. They're keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me, though I know that's not always reliable. Their hands are palms up and arms are open, which often reads as non-defensive or receptive, like they're trying to seem trustworthy. There's no fidgeting, no nervous gestures like touching their face or crossing arms, and they're not avoiding eye contact or looking around too much. If I had to guess based on just this, it *feels* like they're being straightforward, especially since their expression is neutral—no forced smiles or scowls that sometimes happen when people are trying to cover up a lie.  

But honestly, I'm not totally sure. I've read that some people who lie actually *overdo* the open gestures to seem innocent, like they're trying too hard to look honest. And maybe they're just naturally calm or used to speaking like this—some people are just comfortable with direct eye contact without it meaning anything. I also wonder if the context matters: if they're answering something really personal or stressful, even truthful people might act differently. Like, if they were asked a question they're genuinely upset about, the lack of emotional reactions (no frowning, no awkward pauses) could just mean they're trying to stay composed, not that they're lying.  

So yeah, the cues here lean toward them being truthful—open posture, steady gaze, no signs of nervousness—but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's possible they're good at hiding it, or maybe they're just not the type to show stress. I'd say it's *more likely* they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the actual conversation or see more context before I felt confident. Like, if they'd been avoiding eye contact or had a shaky voice, that'd tip it the other way, but this just feels... calm. Not like deception.

From what I observe in the video, the person appears calm and maintains open posture, with steady eye contact and palms-up gestures, which often suggest honesty. They show no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, face touching, or avoiding eye contact, and their neutral expression lacks forced smiles or scowls commonly associated with deception. However, these cues alone don’t guarantee truthfulness.  

It’s worth considering that some individuals who lie might exaggerate openness and calmness to appear innocent, almost as if they are trying too hard to seem credible. Their composed demeanor could also be natural or practiced, rather than a genuine reflection of honesty. Additionally, if the topic is sensitive, a lack of emotional response might indicate suppression or discomfort rather than straightforwardness.  

Given this, while the signs lean somewhat toward truthfulness, I find myself leaning more toward the possibility that they might be hiding something. It’s not definitive, but based on these observations, there is a reasonable chance the person could be deceptive—even if they’re doing a good job at masking it. More context or verbal cues would be needed to be more certain.

Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not sure. The person seems a bit tense while answering, which makes me lean toward them not being completely comfortable. I noticed their eyebrows were raised and kind of furrowed at the same time—like they were really concentrating or maybe stressed about what they were saying. They kept glancing sideways a few times instead of looking directly at whoever was talking to them, which sometimes happens when people are trying to think of what to say next, but it could also just be their natural way of speaking. They nodded a couple of times while they were talking, which might seem like agreement, but it could just be a nervous habit. And their palms were facing up the whole time, which usually feels like an open, honest gesture—like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything.  

But then again, I'm not totally convinced it's deception. Maybe they're just genuinely worried about the topic they're discussing. Frowning and raised eyebrows could easily come from confusion or concern, not lying. I've seen people do that when they're trying to be careful with their words, not necessarily when they're hiding something. And that sideways glance? Some people just naturally look away when they're thinking, especially if they're not used to being on camera. The palms-up thing really stands out to me as a counterpoint—it's usually seen as a sign of sincerity, so if they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact altogether.  

Honestly, though, it's hard to say for sure. Body language is super tricky because it's so context-dependent. If this was a high-stakes situation, like a police interview, the sideways glance and furrowed brows might feel more suspicious. But if they're just talking casually about something personal, it could just be them being thoughtful. I don't think I'd call it a clear sign of lying, but I also wouldn't rule it out. It feels more like they're being cautious or a little anxious, which doesn't automatically mean they're lying. I'd need more context—like what they were actually saying—to feel confident either way. Right now, I'm leaning toward "maybe not lying," but I'm not sure at all.

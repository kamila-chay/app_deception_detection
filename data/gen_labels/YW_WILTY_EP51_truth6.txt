Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I can't say for certain. The person keeps direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels more natural when someone's being honest, especially compared to how some people avert their gaze when lying. They're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, and there's no awkward pauses or fake smiles—things I often associate with someone trying to cover up. The only thing that stands out is that subtle chin moving upward, like they're leaning in a bit, but that could just be them being engaged or thoughtful, not necessarily nervous. 

That said, I know it's tricky because some people are really good at hiding lies—they might stay calm and make eye contact on purpose, or maybe they're just naturally expressive without it meaning anything. And honestly, the absence of "lying" signs doesn't prove truth either; someone could be lying but just really relaxed or practiced. I've seen cases where people who are lying don't show the usual tells because they're focused on not giving themselves away. But in this clip, the overall vibe feels steady—no tension in their posture, no rushed gestures—and the direct gaze feels genuine, not forced. It's not a slam dunk, but I'd say the evidence points more toward truth than deception, even if I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's just... it feels like they're just having a normal conversation, not trying to hide something.

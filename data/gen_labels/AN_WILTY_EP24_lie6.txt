This is a bit challenging to interpret without more context, but based solely on what I observe, I tend to lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. While they appear calm and composed, with no classic nervous signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact—in fact, they maintain steady gaze and keep their arms open, which usually suggests openness—this very composure seems somewhat unusual. One might expect at least some subtle emotional reactions, such as a slight hesitation or frown, if they were discussing something truthful and potentially stressful. The absence of those reactions might indicate they are so practiced at lying that they can maintain a steady, controlled demeanor, which can itself be a red flag. 

Although the typical tells of deception are missing, this lack of natural response could mean the calmness is more of a carefully maintained facade than genuine honesty. Open arms and direct gaze are often seen as signs of truthfulness, but they can also be consciously used to project sincerity. Without hearing their voice or knowing more about the situation, it’s hard to be certain, but overall, I find myself leaning more toward the possibility that the person is not being entirely truthful, even if the evidence isn’t conclusive.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I’m observing, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying. The one thing that really caught my attention was the noticeable eyebrow raise when they said, “I didn’t know about that.” While eyebrow raises can sometimes indicate genuine surprise or emphasis, they can also be a subtle sign of evasiveness, which makes me suspicious.

What adds to my doubt is that, despite the lack of other classic signs of lying—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses or fake smiles—the absence of these doesn’t necessarily mean they’re telling the truth. In fact, some skilled liars can remain very composed and controlled precisely to avoid detection. Their calmness and steady demeanor might be a deliberate effort to appear credible.

On the other hand, if they were truthful, I would probably expect at least a small sign of nervousness, like a brief glance away or a slight tension in their expression, but none of that showed. It’s unusual to see someone completely at ease when making a potentially deceptive statement.

So, while I can’t say for certain, the eyebrow raise combined with their unusually steady behavior makes me lean toward thinking they might be hiding something. It’s not definitive, but I’d want to look at more evidence before giving them the benefit of the doubt.

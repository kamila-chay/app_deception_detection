Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them not lying—though it's really close. The main thing that stands out is that one time they raised their eyebrows pretty noticeably when they said "I didn't know about that." Now, eyebrow raises can be tricky; sometimes people do it when they're genuinely surprised or trying to emphasize a point, like "Wait, really? I swear I didn't." But I know some people also raise their brows when they're being evasive, so that's why it's confusing. 

What makes me more skeptical about deception is that they didn't do any of the other classic "lying" things. No fidgeting with their hands, no avoiding eye contact (they actually kept looking right at the person asking), no awkward pauses or fake smiles. If they were trying to cover up something, I'd expect them to be a little more nervous—like scratching their neck or shifting in their seat. But they just sat there, calm, and only did that one eyebrow thing. 

On the flip side, though, maybe they're just really good at hiding it. I've heard some people say that skilled liars don't show obvious signs, so the lack of other cues could actually mean they're *too* composed. But honestly, the absence of *any* nervousness feels more like someone who's being straightforward. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect at least a tiny bit of tension—maybe a quick glance away or a forced smile—but there wasn't even that. 

So yeah, I'm torn, but I think the eyebrow raise was probably just them reacting to the question, not a sign of deception. It's not a slam dunk, but the rest of their behavior feels too steady for lying. I'd say truth-telling, but I'd definitely want to see more of the clip to be sure.

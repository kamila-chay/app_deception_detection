Okay, so I just watched this clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. The person seems pretty calm overall. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a good sign for someone being straightforward—like they're not avoiding looking at you, which can sometimes happen when people are hiding something. And they're smiling a lot, especially with their lips pulled up at the corners, not like a fake smile but a natural one, I think. They're also nodding along while they're speaking, which feels like they're engaged and agreeing with what they're saying, not just going through the motions.

But then there's the crossed fingers thing—right at the end, they cross their fingers while talking. I've heard that people sometimes do that when they're lying, like a nervous habit, but honestly, I've also seen people do it all the time without it meaning anything, just a little tic or something they do when they're thinking. And they're touching their head a couple of times—like, just gently, not like they're scratching or rubbing it nervously. That doesn't seem stressed to me; it feels more like a casual gesture, maybe just thinking.

The thing that really stands out is how *not* stressed they seem. No frowning, no looking away a lot, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to talk. Their eyes are open normally, not squinting or darting around. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tension signs—like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat—but they're just sitting there, calm, smiling, nodding. It feels... natural. Like they're just telling a story they believe in.

But I can't be 100% sure. Maybe the smile is too perfect? Or maybe the crossed fingers *is* a sign for them, even if it's not common. I mean, people are weirdly different—some lie with a smile, some tell the truth with crossed fingers. And honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to say if the story itself makes sense. Like, if they're saying something obviously fake, the behavior might not match, but if it's a normal story, the calmness might just mean they're confident.

So yeah... I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because everything else just feels so relaxed and engaged. The crossed fingers is the only thing that makes me pause, but it doesn't feel like a strong red flag compared to all the other cues. It's not like they're sweating or avoiding eye contact. Still, I wouldn't bet my life on it—nonverbal stuff is messy. But based on what I saw, I'd guess they're being honest. Maybe they just have a habit of crossing their fingers when they're talking, and it's totally innocent.

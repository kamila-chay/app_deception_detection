Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone answer a question, and they're keeping pretty steady eye contact the whole time—looking right at the person asking, no shifting gaze or looking away. That's interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but this feels opposite. They also keep raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're genuinely surprised or processing something unexpected, not like they're trying to hide something. I don't see any fidgeting, nervous smiles, or lip movements that usually pop up when people are stressed about lying. They're just... calm, focused, and staring.  

But here's where I'm second-guessing myself. Maybe the eyebrow thing isn't about deception at all—could just be they're genuinely taken aback by the question, like "Wait, *why* are you asking me that?" And the direct eye contact? Sometimes people who lie *practice* staring to seem honest, so it might actually be a red flag. I've seen that before—like when someone's rehearsed a story and thinks locking eyes makes them sound credible. Plus, if they're lying, they might be *too* composed, which feels off for someone who's actually nervous.  

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth, why the constant eyebrow lifts? Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or the question caught them off guard in a way that's innocent. Like, if you ask someone "Did you eat the last cookie?" and they're like, "Wait, *what*? I didn't even see it," their eyebrows would shoot up. That doesn't scream deception—it screams confusion. And the lack of other signs (no blinking, no fidgeting) makes me think they're not stressed about it, which *could* line up with truthfulness.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The eye contact and eyebrow thing don't fit the classic "liar" stereotype, but I know those stereotypes aren't always reliable. I guess I'm leaning toward them *not* lying just because they seem so... relaxed? But I'd need more context—like what the question was, or how they'd usually act. Without that, it's hard to say. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're telling the truth and the eyebrows are just a quirk. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd be way more comfortable saying that if I saw them react to a follow-up question. Right now, I'm just not sure.

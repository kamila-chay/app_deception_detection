This is a bit challenging to determine, but leaning on what I observe, I have some suspicion that the person might be lying. They’re sitting still, not showing any obvious nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which often are signs people associate with deception. However, the fact that they’re looking straight up—staring at the ceiling as if thinking hard—catches my attention. I’ve heard that looking up during a response can sometimes indicate someone is fabricating a story rather than recalling a genuine memory.

While it’s true that people often glance upward when trying to remember something innocuous, in this context, that upward gaze could be a subtle cue pointing toward dishonesty. The absence of usual nervous ticks doesn’t necessarily rule out a lie; some individuals are adept at masking these signs, and a calm exterior can be deceiving. Without hearing the question or having more context, it’s hard to be certain, but this combination makes me lean toward suspecting that the person might not be entirely truthful. It’s not definitive, but given the gaze and the calmness together, I’d cautiously say there’s a likelihood of deception here.

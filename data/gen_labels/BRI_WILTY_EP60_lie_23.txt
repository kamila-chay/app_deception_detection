Hmm, this is actually a bit tricky to call. So I'm watching this clip, and the person is just... sitting there, not doing much. No obvious nervous ticks—no fidgeting with their hands, no weird smiles or frowns, not blinking like crazy or avoiding eye contact. The only thing that stands out is that they're looking straight up, like they're staring at the ceiling or thinking really hard. 

Now, I've heard people say that when someone looks up while answering, it might mean they're making something up, right? Like, their brain's searching for a story instead of recalling something real. But honestly, I'm not totally convinced that's the case here. I've seen people look up when they're just trying to remember something mundane—like trying to recall a phone number or a name. It could be that they're genuinely trying to think of the right answer, not lying. And honestly, the fact that they're *not* doing all the other classic "lie signs" makes me wonder if maybe they're actually telling the truth. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to maybe avoid eye contact more, or seem a bit more stiff, but they're just... calm. 

On the flip side, though, maybe they're really good at hiding it. Some people don't have those obvious tells, so the lack of nervousness could just mean they're practiced. Or maybe the upward gaze *is* a sign here—it's not foolproof, but combined with the context of the question, it might tip things. I mean, if I was asking them something sensitive and they looked up like that, I'd be suspicious. But the clip doesn't give me the question, so I don't know if it's a natural pause for thinking or something else. 

Honestly, I'm not sure. The upward gaze is the only thing that feels like it *could* be a sign, but it's also the kind of thing that happens all the time when people are just thinking. Without any other red flags—like avoiding the question, contradicting themselves, or seeming overly rehearsed—it's hard to say. I'd lean toward maybe they're being truthful because they're not acting weird, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's one of those cases where the silence and lack of movement might actually be more telling than the gaze itself. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to be *doing* something. So yeah, I'm torn—could be truth, could be a smooth lie. I'd need more context to feel confident.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. The person is looking right at the other person the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is on, which feels like they're trying to be engaged, and that's usually a sign of truthfulness, not deception. Liars often avoid eye contact, so this makes me lean a little toward them being honest. But then there's that frequent blinking—they're doing it way more than normal, like every few seconds. That *does* sometimes happen when someone's stressed or lying, so that's a red flag.  

But wait, I'm second-guessing that. Maybe they just have dry eyes, or they're tired, or they're really concentrating on what they're saying. I've seen people blink a lot when they're just nervous about speaking, not necessarily lying. And their head movements—tilting it, moving forward, keeping their head up—those feel natural, like they're listening or thinking, not like someone trying to cover up something. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they're not doing that. The chin moving up is weird though—it could be a micro-expression of defensiveness, but it's hard to tell from just the video.  

The other thing is, they're not smiling or frowning, which is interesting. If they were lying, they might force a smile or look tense, but they seem pretty neutral. That makes me think it might not be deception, but I can't rule it out entirely. Maybe they're just bad at hiding emotions, or maybe they're actually telling the truth but feel awkward about the situation. Honestly, the eye contact is the strongest point for truthfulness, and the blinking could be a false alarm. But I'm not confident—it's really hard to say for sure without more context. I'd guess they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet money on it. Like, it's possible they're lying, but the behavior doesn't scream "deception" to me the way it usually does in those clips.

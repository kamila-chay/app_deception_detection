Looking at the clip, the person seems pretty calm and composed the whole time. They're not fidgeting at all—no touching their face, no hand movements, not even shifting in their seat. Their eyes are mostly fixed on the person they're talking to, but not in a way that feels natural; it's like they're staring a little too steadily, almost like they're forcing themselves to look directly at the speaker. I noticed they don't blink much either, which is kind of odd. Normally, people blink a lot when they're stressed or lying, but here it's the opposite—almost no blinking.  

At first glance, that calmness makes me think they might be telling the truth because liars often seem nervous. But then I remember that some people are really good at hiding their nerves, especially if they're practiced or just very confident. And that steady eye contact without blinking? It feels a bit *too* controlled, like they're trying too hard to seem relaxed. I've seen videos where people who are lying actually hold their gaze longer to seem sincere, even if it comes across as stiff.  

On the flip side, it's possible they're just naturally calm—maybe they're not nervous because they *are* telling the truth, or maybe they're used to being interviewed. Some people avoid eye contact when they're lying, but here they're *not* avoiding it, which is confusing. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like fidgeting or looking away, but there's nothing. Still, the absence of nervousness doesn't prove truth—it just means they're not showing it.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The lack of typical "nervous" cues could go either way. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward deception just because that unnaturally steady gaze and lack of blinking feel like they're overcompensating, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context—like what they're talking about or their usual behavior—to feel confident. I'd say it's suspicious, but not definitive.

Watching the clip, the person appears remarkably calm and composed, showing no signs of fidgeting—no touching their face, no hand movements, and no shifting in their seat. Their eyes remain mostly fixed on the person they're speaking to, but the way they maintain this gaze feels somewhat unnatural, as if they're forcing themselves to hold eye contact too steadily. Additionally, their infrequent blinking stands out; typically, people blink more when nervous or deceptive, so this near absence of blinking seems unusual.

At first glance, this composed demeanor might suggest honesty, since liars often display nervousness. However, some individuals are adept at concealing their anxiety, and the overly steady eye contact combined with minimal blinking could indicate a form of deliberate control. There are instances where people who are being untruthful try to appear sincere by maintaining prolonged eye contact, resulting in a somewhat stiff and unnatural expression.

On the other hand, it's possible they're simply naturally calm or accustomed to being interviewed, which might explain the lack of typical nervous cues. While many liars avoid eye contact, this person does not, which complicates the interpretation. One might expect more visible signs of tension if they were lying, but none are present here. Still, the absence of nervous behaviors doesn’t necessarily confirm honesty; it could just mean that any stress is being carefully masked.

Ultimately, while there’s no clear evidence, the combination of unnaturally steady eye contact and minimal blinking suggests they might be overcompensating to appear relaxed, which leans me slightly toward suspecting deception. However, without additional context about what they're saying or their usual behavior, it's hard to be certain. The behavior strikes me as suspicious, though not definitively dishonest.

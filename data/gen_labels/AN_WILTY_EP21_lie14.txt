Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful based on what I'm seeing. They're making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to, which is interesting because most people who lie tend to avoid eye contact, but here they're actually looking at the interlocutor quite steadily. However, they keep glancing sideways—like their eyes drift off to the side while they're speaking, almost like they're checking something or trying to remember a detail. That sideways movement, combined with the head tilting and slight side-turning, feels a bit off to me. It’s not the classic "avoiding eyes" thing, but it’s not natural either—like they're not fully present in the moment.  

On the flip side, I can see why someone might think they're being honest. They're not fidgeting, not smiling awkwardly, not blinking a lot, or doing anything that screams "nervous liar." In fact, they seem pretty calm and composed, which makes me wonder if they're just a very steady person or maybe they're just rehearsed. I've seen people who lie without any obvious signs—they're just good at hiding it. So it could be that they're actually telling the truth, and those sideways glances are just how they think, or maybe they're just distracted by something in the room.  

But here's what's making me hesitate: the sideways gaze feels repetitive, like it’s not accidental. When people are being truthful, their eye movements are usually more fluid and less fixed on the same "away" direction. It’s subtle, but it sticks out to me. I’m not saying it’s definitive—there’s no way to know for sure without context—but based on the behavior alone, I’d lean toward deception. It’s not a huge red flag, but it’s enough to make me question if they’re holding back something. Like, they’re not *acting* guilty, but they’re not *fully* engaged either. Honestly, I’d need more to go on to feel confident, but right now, I’d say it’s probably deception.

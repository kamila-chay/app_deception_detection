Honestly, I'm not sure I'd be 100% confident either way just from watching, but based on what I see, it seems like they're probably telling the truth. The way they're looking directly at the person they're talking to—like, not avoiding eye contact, just naturally holding it—feels like something truthful people do. And that little smile they have, the corners of their lips actually lifting up a bit, seems genuine, not forced like when people fake a smile to seem friendly. They're also nodding along, which usually matches what someone's saying when they're being sincere.  

But I can see why someone might question it too. The fact that their gaze sometimes goes sideways—like, not straight on, but not away either—makes me pause a little. Sometimes people look sideways when they're thinking or trying to recall something, which could be neutral, but I've also heard people say it might be a sign of discomfort. Still, they're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, not covering their mouth or anything that usually screams "I'm lying." If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy, like shifting in their seat or looking down a lot. Here, they seem pretty calm and engaged.  

Honestly, the more I think about it, the more the natural smile and steady eye contact stand out. Those things just don't usually line up with someone who's trying to hide something. But I'm not saying it's impossible—they could be really good at faking it. I mean, I've seen people who lie smoothly without any of those classic tells. Still, based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're being honest than not. I'd lean toward truth, but yeah, I'd want to hear the whole story before I'd be totally sure.

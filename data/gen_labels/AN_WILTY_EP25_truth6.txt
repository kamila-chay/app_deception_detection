Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person seems pretty calm overall. They're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign they're being honest—liars often avoid that. But then there's this one thing that sticks out: they keep doing this really exaggerated eye closing, like they're squeezing their eyes shut super tight for a second. I've seen people do that when they're trying to emphasize something, or maybe when they're thinking hard, but it feels a bit... forced? Like they're overdoing it on purpose. 

On the other hand, they don't have any of the classic "lying" tells I've heard about—no frowning, no weird lip movements, no nervous blinking, no looking away a lot (they're actually glancing sideways sometimes, but that could just be them processing what they're saying, not necessarily lying). Their head tilts a bit when they're listening, which seems natural, like they're engaged. And they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact at all—they're looking right at the camera or the person they're speaking to most of the time. 

But here's where I'm second-guessing: maybe that exaggerated eye closing is just their normal way of talking? Like, maybe they always do that when they're getting emotional or making a point, and it's not related to lying at all. I've known people who have quirks like that—like a specific gesture they use when they're stressed or excited, not because they're hiding something. And since they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, it kinda cancels out the weird eye thing. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The eye closing is the only thing that makes me pause, but it could easily be a habit. Without more context—like what they're actually saying or the situation—it's hard to tell. If they were just describing a boring fact, that eye thing might seem odd, but if they're sharing something emotional, it might just be part of their expression. I guess I'd lean toward them being truthful because the rest of their behavior doesn't scream "lying," but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just... weird enough that I'd wonder, but not weird enough to call it a lie. Yeah, I think they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those things where you just have to go with the overall vibe, and the vibe here feels pretty steady.

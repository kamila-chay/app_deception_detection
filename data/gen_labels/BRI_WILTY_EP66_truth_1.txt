Looking at the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—these things are so hard to judge just from video. What stands out to me is how they keep raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes really wide, almost like they're trying to look extra attentive or sincere. That kind of exaggerated eye opening sometimes happens when people are being genuine, like when they're genuinely surprised or trying to emphasize something. And they're nodding a lot while talking, which usually feels like natural agreement, not something you'd fake if you were lying. The way they're looking around—up, down, sideways—doesn't seem forced; it feels like they're actually thinking about what they're saying, which makes me lean toward truth because liars often stare too much or avoid eye contact.  

But then again, the head turning sideways a few times and that exaggerated mouth opening... those could be overcompensating. Like, maybe they're nervous and trying too hard to seem relaxed, which sometimes happens when people are lying. I've heard that when people fabricate stories, they might add extra gestures to sell it. And the raised eyebrows? Could be surprise, but it could also be a sign of tension, like they're not sure if they're getting away with it.  

Honestly, though, the lack of other "red flags" makes me hesitate. No frowning, no lip biting, no awkward pauses—they're not doing the classic "I'm lying" stuff like covering their mouth or avoiding eye contact entirely. The gaze shifting seems natural, not like they're avoiding something. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not at all confident. It could easily be a nervous person telling the truth, or someone who's really good at faking it. Without knowing what they're talking about, it's impossible to be sure. I'd need more context to feel comfortable with an answer.

Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely clear. They mostly maintain eye contact, which some believe isn't typical for liars, yet they occasionally glance down in a way that feels somewhat evasive, as if they're trying to avoid direct eye contact while still seeming engaged. Their raised eyebrows, which could indicate surprise or attentive listening, combined with frequent blinking, often signal stress or possible insincerity. While raised eyebrows and blinking can also be explained by fatigue or confusion, the combination here feels like it might suggest some level of discomfort beyond simple tiredness. The head tilt, normally a sign of thinking, doesn’t strongly contradict this, but the overall mix of signals—especially the inconsistent gaze and nervous mannerisms—pushes me to suspect that there could be deception involved. It’s far from certain, as they don’t appear overtly tense, and some cues align with genuine anxiety, but on balance, I tend to interpret these behaviors as leaning toward the possibility that they might not be telling the full truth.

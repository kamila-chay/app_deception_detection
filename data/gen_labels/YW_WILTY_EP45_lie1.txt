Hmm, watching this clip, I'm really not sure. The person seems to be looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which makes me wonder—some people think liars avoid eye contact, but here they're actually holding it, even if they also glance down sometimes. That gaze down feels a bit odd though, like they're avoiding direct eye contact *while* still looking at the person, which could be nervousness. And their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently, like they're surprised or trying to seem engaged, and they're blinking a lot—those two things together often make me think someone's stressed or faking it. But wait, raised eyebrows can also just mean they're listening closely or confused, right? And blinking a lot might just be because they're tired or the room's bright, not necessarily lying. The head tilting is another thing—people tilt their heads when they're thinking hard, not always when they're lying. I guess if they were telling the truth, they might seem more relaxed, but they don't seem super tense either. Honestly, the cues are all over the place. It's hard to say for sure if it's deception or just someone being a bit anxious while explaining something. I'd lean toward maybe deception because of the blinking and the mixed gaze, but I wouldn't bet on it—could easily be a nervous truth-teller.

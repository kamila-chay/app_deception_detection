Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. From what I'm seeing in the clip, the person is making direct eye contact the whole time—gazing right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, not deception. But they're also frowning a bit with their eyebrows, and at times, raising them—like they're reacting to something. That mix is confusing.  

On one hand, the lack of classic "nervous" tells stands out: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird blinking or lip movements. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those subtle signs, like shifting in their seat or touching their face. Instead, they seem pretty still and focused, which makes me lean toward "truthful." Maybe they're just genuinely stressed about what they're saying, or the topic is heavy, and that's why their eyebrows are doing that frown-and-raised thing—like they're processing something tough.  

But then again, sometimes liars *overcompensate* with too much eye contact to seem credible, and the eyebrow thing could be a nervous tic they're not even aware of. Like, if they're rehearsing a lie, they might tense up their face in ways that look like confusion or skepticism. I've seen that before—people who aren't used to lying might accidentally show micro-expressions that don't match their words.  

Still, the absence of other cues feels stronger to me. If they were lying, I'd expect more "tells," like a shaky voice or a pause that feels forced. Here, the pauses seem natural, and they're not avoiding the gaze. It’s possible they’re just a little tense about the conversation, not lying. I’d say it’s *more likely* they’re being truthful, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it—deception can be really subtle, and it’s easy to misread someone’s mood. Honestly, I’d want to hear the actual words they’re saying before I’d feel confident either way.

This is a bit challenging, but based on what I’m observing, I’m leaning toward the person probably not being entirely truthful. They seem quite tense, with their eyebrows drawn down in a frown and lips pulled downward, which often signals discomfort. While this could be due to concentration, such tension can also suggest stress related to hiding something. Their frequent blinking might indicate nervousness, though it could also be explained by fatigue or lighting. The way their eyes dart sideways rather than maintaining eye contact seems like avoidance, which is commonly linked to dishonesty, but it might also be them trying to think or recall information. The mixed signals with their head movements—shaking "no" while simultaneously nodding—are odd and could point to internal conflict or uncertainty about their own statements, which sometimes happens when someone isn’t being fully honest. The raised chin might be an unconscious attempt to appear confident or defiant, possibly masking discomfort. On the other hand, they aren’t displaying some of the more overt signs of lying, like forced smiles or covering their mouth, and their reserved facial expressions might just mean they’re cautious or stressed rather than deceptive. Still, considering the combination of subtle cues and inconsistencies, I tend to believe they might be leaning towards deception, though I can’t say this with absolute certainty. It’s difficult to be sure without more context or hearing what they’re actually saying.

Hmm, this is tricky—I'm trying to figure out if they're lying just based on what I'm seeing, and honestly, it's not super clear. The person seems pretty tense while talking. Their eyebrows are pulled down like they're really frowning, and their lips are pulled downward too, not smiling at all. That kind of grimace usually feels like discomfort, which could mean they're stressed about what they're saying, but it could also just be their natural expression when they're concentrating. They're blinking a lot, which I've heard people say can signal nervousness, but I've also seen people blink a lot when they're just tired or in a bright room, so that's not a sure thing.

Their eyes keep darting sideways a lot instead of looking at the person they're talking to, which might feel like they're avoiding eye contact—something people often associate with lying. But I've noticed sometimes people look away when they're thinking hard or trying to remember something, not necessarily because they're hiding something. And then there's the head shaking—like they're saying "no" while they're talking, but they're also nodding along to what they're saying? That kind of mixed signal is confusing. Like, why shake your head "no" while you're agreeing? It could be a nervous habit, or maybe they're just trying to emphasize something without realizing it. The chin moving upward a bit too—like they're lifting their chin like they're being defiant—could feel like they're trying to seem confident, but it might just be a little unconscious gesture.

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the classic "lying" tells people talk about, like smiling when they shouldn't or covering their mouth. They're actually keeping their mouth closed a lot, which might mean they're being careful with their words, but that could also just be how they talk. And they're not laughing or making exaggerated faces, which sometimes happens when people are being fake. Honestly, the more I watch, the less sure I am. It could be they're stressed about the situation—maybe they're nervous about the topic, not necessarily lying. Or it could be they're hiding something. I'd probably need to hear what they're saying or see more context to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward it being more about stress than deception, but I really don't know for sure. It's just hard to tell from a video alone.

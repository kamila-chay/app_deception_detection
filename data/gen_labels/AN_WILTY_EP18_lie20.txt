Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% certain, but there are a few things that stand out to me that make me lean toward them not being entirely truthful. The person is smiling quite a bit, which is a bit confusing because people often smile when they're comfortable or happy, not necessarily when they're lying. But then they keep raising their eyebrows—like, really frequently—and that feels a little off. I've noticed that when people are trying to seem casual while hiding something, they sometimes do that nervous eyebrow thing. 

What really sticks out is how they keep looking down while still facing the person, and they're turning their head sideways a lot—like, not just a little tilt, but a clear side-turn. I've heard from some psychology stuff that people often avoid direct eye contact when lying, and looking down or turning away can be a sign of that. It’s not like they’re staring at the floor the whole time; they’re still making some effort to engage, but the sideways head movement feels deliberate, like they’re trying to create distance or avoid being pinned down. 

That said, I can totally see why it might not be deception. Maybe they’re just really shy or awkward in this situation—some people naturally turn their head when they’re thinking or feeling nervous, even if they’re telling the truth. The smile could just be their way of being polite or trying to seem friendly, not a fake smile. And the eyebrows? Could be surprise or just a habit, like they’re processing what they’re saying. I’ve known people who do that all the time without it meaning anything. 

Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. The head turning and the down gaze are the strongest clues for me, but they’re not definitive. If I had to guess based on what I’m watching, I’d lean toward deception—not because it’s obvious, but because those behaviors together feel like a mix of trying to seem calm (smiling) while subtly avoiding engagement (looking down, head turn). But I’d be really hesitant to say it’s 100% true. It could easily just be their normal way of talking, and I’d need more context to feel confident. Like, are they in a stressful situation? Do they usually act like this? Without that, I’m just going by what’s visible, and it’s a bit of a toss-up.

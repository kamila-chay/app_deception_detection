Looking at the clip, it's honestly a bit tricky to pin down. The person seems pretty composed overall—no obvious signs like frowning, avoiding eye contact, or nervous gestures like hand rubbing. They're actually looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, which often leans toward truthfulness since liars sometimes glance away. Their hands are touching their head or neck a few times, which could just be them thinking or adjusting, not necessarily a stress sign. And those palms up? That feels like an open, honest gesture—like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything.  

But then there's the frequent blinking. That *could* be a red flag for stress or lying, right? People do blink more when they're anxious. I wonder if they're just nervous about the situation, though—maybe they're not used to being recorded or are genuinely trying to be careful with their words. If they *were* lying, I'd expect more signs like a forced smile, lip biting, or avoiding eye contact entirely, but none of that's here. The lack of those classic "liar tells" makes me lean away from deception.  

On the flip side, maybe they're a really good liar who knows to keep eye contact and avoid obvious tells. Or maybe the blinking is just a habit—some people blink a lot naturally. Without hearing the actual words or seeing the context, it's hard to say if they're stressed about the topic or just being cautious. The hands touching their head might even be a sign they're *thinking hard* about what to say, not necessarily lying.  

Honestly, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. The cues are mixed—some point to honesty (eye contact, palms up), some are neutral (blinking, hand touches), and there's no clear "gotcha" evidence of lying. If I had to put a number on it, maybe 60% truth, 40% uncertainty. But in the moment, watching it, I'd say they seem more like someone being careful than someone trying to pull a fast one.

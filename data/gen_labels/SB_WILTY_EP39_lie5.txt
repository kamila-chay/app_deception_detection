After watching the clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language can mean so many things depending on context. On one hand, they're smiling—lip corners up, which usually feels like a genuine expression—but it's not the kind of smile that crinkles the eyes, so it might be forced. I've seen people fake smiles when they're nervous or trying to seem calm, especially if they're hiding something. Then there's the way they're looking down a lot instead of making eye contact, which often happens when someone's lying to avoid being caught. Their chin moving up and down a few times too—it feels like they're trying to hold back words or control their expression, which I've heard can be a sign of discomfort. And the head tilting/side-turning? That’s usually a sign of engagement or thought, but in this case, it might just be them shifting because they're not comfortable.  

But here’s where I hesitate: they have their palms up, which people often do when they're being open or honest, and they're not fidgeting or blinking a lot, which are common signs of lying. Maybe they're just naturally expressive or really trying to seem calm. The smile could also just be polite—they might be answering a friendly question, not something they're hiding. I've definitely seen people look down while thinking about something honestly, not just when lying. And that head tilt? Could be curiosity, not deception.  

So yeah, I'm leaning toward deception because of the gaze down and the chin movements feeling a bit off, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to overread body language—sometimes people just have nervous habits. If I had to guess based on just the video, I'd say they're probably not being completely truthful, but it's not a slam dunk. It feels like they're trying too hard to seem relaxed, which makes me doubt them more than the other cues. Still, I'd want to see more context before I'd be confident.

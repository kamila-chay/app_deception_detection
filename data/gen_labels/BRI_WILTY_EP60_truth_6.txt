Okay, so I just watched the clip again, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person is sitting there with their head shaking "no" a couple times while looking right at whoever's asking the question—like they're directly answering. That eye contact feels a bit off for someone who's lying, you know? I've heard the myth that liars avoid eye contact, but I think I've read enough since then that it's not reliable. In fact, sometimes people who are being truthful *do* hold eye contact when they're being firm or frustrated. And they *are* frowning a bit while doing it—like they're genuinely annoyed or stressed by the question, not just acting. That frown doesn't look fake; it seems like it's coming from somewhere real, like they're processing something heavy.  

But then, the head shaking... if they were lying, wouldn't they maybe shake their head *more* nervously? Or look away? I mean, the shaking here is pretty deliberate, like a clear "no," not a jittery, anxious movement. And they're not doing anything else that screams "lying" to me—no fidgeting, no weird smiles, no avoiding eye contact. The lack of those classic "lie" signs actually makes me lean toward them being honest. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect them to be a little more tense, maybe touch their face or look down.  

On the flip side, though, maybe the frown is a red herring. Could they be frowning because they *know* they're lying and are stressed about it? Maybe. But the direct eye contact still sticks with me. It feels like they're trying to be clear, not evasive. And the head shake—when someone's being truthful about denying something, they often do that exact motion without overdoing it. It doesn't feel rehearsed or forced.  

I guess the thing that's really making me hesitate is that I don't know the context. Like, what are they denying? If it's something small and they're just annoyed about being asked, that frown makes sense. But if it's a big lie, maybe they'd show more signs. Still, based on *just* what I'm seeing in the video—no dodging eyes, no nervous gestures, just a focused "no" with a frown—I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. But I'm not 100% sure. It's possible they're really good at hiding it, or maybe the frown is just their normal face when they're thinking hard. Honestly, it's one of those cases where the lack of obvious deception feels more telling than anything else. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

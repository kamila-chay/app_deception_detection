Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't screaming one way or the other. What stands out to me is that they're keeping direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true, so they're not avoiding the camera or shifting their eyes away, which usually makes me lean toward truthfulness. Plus, their palms are up, which feels open and non-defensive, like they're trying to seem approachable. I've heard that palms up can signal honesty, so that gives me pause for thought.  

But then there's the frequent blinking and those raised eyebrows—they're not smiling or frowning, which is interesting. Frequent blinking often gets flagged as a stress sign, like when someone's nervous, and raised eyebrows can sometimes mean surprise or even skepticism, not necessarily lying. I keep wondering if they're just naturally expressive or maybe the lighting is making their eyes twitch. Like, maybe they're just tired or the room's stuffy, not lying.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more classic signs—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that "lip corner down" thing that often happens when people are being evasive. But they're not doing any of that. No scowling, no awkward pauses with their mouth shut, no hands covering their face. The absence of those tells me it's less likely they're hiding something.  

Still, I can't rule out the blinking entirely. Maybe they're just processing what they're saying, or it's a habit. I've seen people blink a lot when they're telling the truth too—like when they're trying to remember details. And the raised eyebrows? Could be genuine surprise at a question, not deception.  

Honestly, I'm torn but leaning toward truth. The open palms and steady gaze feel stronger to me than the minor nervous ticks. It doesn't *feel* like a lie, but I'd be lying if I said I'm 100% sure. People get nervous when they're being honest too, so I'm not gonna call it a slam dunk. I'd say it's probably truth, but if I were guessing, I'd say "maybe" with a shrug—not "definitely."

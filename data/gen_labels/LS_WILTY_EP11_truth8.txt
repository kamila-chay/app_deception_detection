From what I can see in the video, the person is smiling, making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to, and occasionally looking down while tilting their head to the side. They're also turning their head slightly sideways while speaking, and their head stays mostly upright. There's no frowning, no nervous gestures like fidgeting or covering their mouth, and they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact. Honestly, it's a bit hard to say for sure just from behavior alone—people can smile and look engaged when they're lying, and not everyone who's truthful looks like they're "acting natural." But the way they're holding eye contact while smiling, especially with that slight head tilt that feels like they're genuinely listening or thinking, makes me lean toward them being truthful. It’s not the kind of smile that seems forced or out of place; it matches the tone of the conversation.  

That said, I wonder if the gaze down could be a red flag—some people look down when they're rehearsing a lie or avoiding accountability. And head tilting can sometimes be a nervous habit, though it’s also common when someone’s processing what they’re saying. But in this case, it’s paired with a relaxed smile and steady eye contact, which feels more like someone who’s comfortable with what they’re saying. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of tension—like darting eyes, a stiff posture, or those awkward pauses where their mouth stays closed. Here, their expression is open, and they’re not hiding anything physically. Still, I’m not 100% certain. Maybe they’re just good at faking it, or maybe they’re just naturally expressive. But based on what I’m seeing, I’d guess they’re telling the truth—not because it’s obvious, but because the cues don’t line up with what I’d expect from someone who’s trying to deceive. It just feels… consistent. Like they’re not trying to hide anything.

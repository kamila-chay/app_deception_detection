Looking at this clip, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. The smile usually suggests openness, but it’s contradicted by the frown and raised eyebrows, which feel more like stress or discomfort. Their chin movements and constant shifting of the head strike me as signs of someone trying to manage their nerves or hold something back, which often happens when people aren’t telling the truth.  

Their gaze is a bit inconsistent—sometimes directly at the other person, other times darting away—which could be an attempt to appear engaged while hiding something. The frequent hand scratching is a nervous habit that could indicate anxiety, potentially linked to deception.  

On the other hand, the open palms and nodding suggest attempts at honesty or cooperation, and the smile could simply mean they’re anxious rather than dishonest. Still, the conflicting signals—the smile mixed with a frown and the restless movements—make me lean toward the idea that they might not be fully truthful. It’s not definitive, and I’d need more information to be sure, but based on these cues, I’d say there’s a good chance they’re being deceptive, maybe around 60-40 in favor of that interpretation.

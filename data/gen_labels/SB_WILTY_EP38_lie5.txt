Hmm, looking at this clip, it's a bit tricky to call. The person is smiling, which usually feels like a sign of openness or agreement, but they're also frowning with their eyebrows raised at the same time—that’s kind of contradictory. Like, they’re trying to look friendly but also stressed or confused. I noticed their chin moving up and down a lot, almost like they’re trying to hold back something, and their head’s constantly shifting—forward, backward, side-to-side. That’s a lot of movement, and when people are lying, they often fidget more or have these little involuntary adjustments.  

Their gaze is all over the place too: up, down, sideways, but also directly at the person they’re talking to. That’s interesting because sometimes people avoid eye contact when lying, but here they’re looking at the other person while still glancing away—maybe they’re trying to seem engaged but it’s not quite matching. And they’re scratching their hands a lot, which is a classic nervous habit. I’ve seen people scratch when they’re anxious, not necessarily lying, but it’s a red flag in these situations.  

On the other hand, they’re keeping their palms up the whole time, which usually signals honesty or openness, and they’re nodding a lot, which feels like they’re trying to seem cooperative. The smile is there, too, so maybe they’re just really nervous about the topic, not lying. Like, maybe they’re in an awkward situation where they’re trying to be polite but struggling with the stress of it.  

I guess the biggest thing making me lean toward deception is the mix of the smile with the frown and the constant fidgeting—like their body’s not syncing up with what they’re saying. But I’m not totally sure. People scratch for all sorts of reasons, and palms up isn’t a foolproof sign. It’s possible they’re just naturally expressive or really anxious about the question. Honestly, I’d need more context—like what they’re talking about—to feel confident. But based on the cues here, it’s hard to shake the feeling that the nervousness is outweighing the "honest" signals. So I’d guess deception, but I’d say it’s not 100% clear-cut. Maybe 60-40 that they’re not being fully truthful.

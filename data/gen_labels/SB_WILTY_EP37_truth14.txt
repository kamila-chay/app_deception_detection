Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty composed overall—they're not fidgeting, not covering their mouth, and they don't have that "deer in headlights" look you sometimes see when people are lying. Their eyes move around a lot—up, down, sideways—like they're thinking or recalling something, which actually feels pretty natural when you're trying to remember details. I've noticed that when people are being honest and just trying to explain something, they often glance away like that while they're processing. But then there's the chin movement—up and down a couple of times. At first, I thought that might be a nervous tic, like they're trying to hold back a reaction, but I've seen people do that even when they're calm, especially when they're talking about something that's a bit heavy. 

On the flip side, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely—gaze is shifting but not darting away, and they're not doing those classic "lying" things like over-smiling, touching their face, or crossing arms. If they were making stuff up, I'd expect more of those signs, like maybe more frequent blinking or fidgeting. The head side-turning also seems relaxed, not like a forced "I'm hiding something" move. But here's where I'm not sure: sometimes people who are lying *do* try to seem calm, so the lack of obvious tells could just mean they're good at hiding it. Or maybe they're just naturally expressive with their chin when they're thinking. 

Honestly, the more I watch, the more it feels like they're just being earnest. The way they hold their head up while talking, the steady gaze shifts without panic—it doesn't scream "lying." It’s not perfect evidence, but the absence of red flags makes me lean toward truth. Still, I can't say for sure. Maybe the chin movement is just a habit, or maybe the gaze shifts are because they're tired. It’s hard to say without knowing the context, but based on what I'm seeing, I’d guess they're telling the truth, though I’d want to hear more of the conversation to be confident.

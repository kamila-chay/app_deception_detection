This is a tricky one. At first glance, the person appears calm and open—they maintain steady eye contact and have relaxed, open arms, which typically suggest honesty. There's no fidgeting, avoidance, or forced facial expressions, which are common signs of deception. On the surface, it seems like they’re not physically hiding anything, and those classic "nervous liar" cues are absent. 

However, the smoothness of their behavior raises some doubts. Sometimes, when people are lying, they consciously overcompensate—holding eye contact too deliberately or adopting an open posture to appear trustworthy. I've seen these exact gestures deliberately faked before, so the lack of nervous tells might actually be the real red flag here. 

Without knowing the context or hearing their tone of voice, it’s hard to be certain. Their calmness could be genuine or a practiced cover-up. Given these factors, while the person might be telling the truth, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they could be deceiving. The behavior looks honest, but it also feels a bit too controlled, suggesting they might be skilled at hiding the truth.

From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty calm overall. They're keeping their arms open and palms facing up, which usually feels like an open, non-threatening posture—like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything. Their eyes are mostly on the person they're talking to, and they even have a small smile, which often comes with genuine engagement. But then there's that thing with their eyebrows—they keep raising them a bit, like they're surprised or maybe a little on edge. I've seen people do that when they're trying to sound convincing, but it could also just be how they naturally react when they're thinking hard. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, why would they keep their arms open and palms up? That’s usually the opposite of the closed-off, defensive posture people use when they're being deceptive. And the smile feels natural, not forced—they're not faking a grin or anything. But then again, some people who lie *do* use open gestures to seem trustworthy, so that might not mean much. The gaze down a bit could just mean they're being modest or thoughtful, not avoiding eye contact like some think liars do. Honestly, it's tricky. The open body language leans toward truth, but the raised eyebrows give me a tiny doubt. I’m not 100% sure, but it feels more like they’re being honest than not—just hard to pin down completely. Like, maybe they’re just a little nervous about what they’re saying, but not lying.

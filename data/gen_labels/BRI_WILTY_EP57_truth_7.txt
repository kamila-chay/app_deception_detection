Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed overall. They're nodding along while speaking, which feels natural—like they're agreeing with themselves or just processing what they're saying. Their eyes are wide open in a way that seems a bit exaggerated, like they're really trying to emphasize something, but they're not smiling or frowning, and they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact with the camera—they're actually looking directly at it most of the time, though sometimes their gaze drifts down toward their hands or the floor. That downward glance makes me think they might be recalling something, not necessarily hiding it. 

What stands out is how still they are—no fidgeting, no hands moving around, no nervous ticks like biting lips or touching their face. Usually, when people are lying, they might do something like that, but here they're just sitting there, calm and steady. The nodding feels genuine, like they're just reinforcing their point, not trying to convince someone. 

But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe that exaggerated eye opening is just how they talk—some people naturally widen their eyes when they're being earnest. And the gaze down could just mean they're concentrating, not that they're lying. I've seen people look down when they're being truthful too, like when they're thinking hard about an answer. On the flip side, if they *were* lying, they might be so practiced that they're not showing the usual signs, or maybe they're just really tired and not reacting the way I'd expect. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The lack of obvious "tells" leans toward them being honest, but I can't rule out that they're just a very calm liar or that the behavior is just their normal way of speaking. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

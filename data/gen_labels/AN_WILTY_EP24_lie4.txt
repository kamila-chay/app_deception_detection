Watching the clip, I’m honestly a bit torn. On one hand, the person is smiling and nodding a lot while keeping eye contact with the person they’re talking to, which usually feels like openness—like they’re engaged and trying to be convincing. The arms are open, which often signals honesty or approachability, and they’re not fidgeting or avoiding gaze, which makes me think they might be telling the truth. But then there’s that head side-turn they do a few times—like they’re shifting their head slightly to the side while speaking. I’ve heard people say that when someone turns their head sideways while talking, it can feel a bit unnatural, like they’re rehearsing or trying to seem casual. And the smile… it’s there consistently, but it doesn’t really reach their eyes like a genuine one would. It’s polite, maybe even a little tight, and since they’re not laughing or showing any other signs of real warmth, it sticks out.  

But I could be wrong. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive, or maybe they’re in a situation where they *want* to seem friendly and relaxed, not deceptive. The lack of other tells—like blinking a lot, covering their mouth, or crossing arms—makes me wonder if the head movement and smile are just their normal way of talking. Sometimes people smile a lot when they’re nervous, but they’re also smiling *while* nodding and making eye contact, which usually feels more like confidence than lying. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. If I had to guess, I’d lean toward them being a little off—like maybe they’re trying to hide something—but I’d hesitate to call it a lie. It could just be their personality. I’d need to see more of the context or hear what they’re actually saying to feel more certain.

Looking at the clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky to tell just from body language alone. What stands out is how they're holding their face: the eyebrows are raised *and* furrowed at the same time, which feels like they're really concentrating or maybe even confused about what they're saying. Then there's that frequent blinking, which I'd usually associate with nervousness, but I know that can also happen if someone's just tired or the lighting's weird. Their lips are pulled down and kind of pushed out, which looks like they're struggling to phrase something, not like they're trying to hide it.  

The thing that makes me lean a bit toward truth is how they keep their eyes locked on the person they're talking to—no darting around or avoiding contact, which sometimes happens when people are lying. And they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" gestures like fiddling with their hands or covering their mouth, which you'd expect if they were stressed about being deceptive. But then again, some people lie really calmly, so that direct gaze might not mean much.  

On the flip side, the combination of furrowed brows and that awkward lip thing could just mean they're genuinely frustrated or upset about the topic—not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're trying to be honest but it's hard for them to explain, so they look tense. I've seen people look like that when they're being truthful but just really frustrated.  

Honestly, the blinking is the part that keeps me second-guessing—it *does* feel like a sign of stress, but stress doesn't always mean lying. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It feels more like they're just in a headspace where they're not comfortable with the question, not that they're actively hiding something. But yeah, it's really hard to say for sure without knowing what they're talking about.

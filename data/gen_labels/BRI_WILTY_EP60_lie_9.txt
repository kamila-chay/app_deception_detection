Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit tricky to call. The person is definitely looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—no shifting eyes up or down, which is interesting because I usually think of liars avoiding eye contact, but maybe they're trying extra hard to seem sincere. That part makes me wonder if they're actually being careful, not necessarily lying. But then there's this constant hand rubbing—like they're just rubbing their palms together over and over, almost like they're nervous or trying to calm themselves down. That's the part that sticks out to me the most.  

On the flip side, though, they're not doing any of the other classic "liar tells" I've heard about—no fidgeting with their face, no awkward pauses where their mouth's shut, no fake smiles or sudden frowns. If they *were* lying, I'd expect maybe more signs of stress, like blinking a lot or looking away more. But they're actually pretty still otherwise, which feels... controlled? Like maybe they're rehearsed or just really good at hiding it. It could also be that they're just naturally fidgety—maybe they're cold, or they're just someone who rubs their hands when they're thinking, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating on a hard question, not when they're hiding something.  

Honestly, the hand rubbing is the only thing that makes me lean toward "maybe lying," but it's not enough to be sure. The steady eye contact actually works against that theory, since most people think liars avoid looking at you. So I'm really torn—it could be they're nervous for a totally innocent reason, or it could be that they're lying but doing a good job of not giving away the obvious tells. I'd say it's a maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it either way. If I had to guess based on just this clip, I'd say... probably not lying, but I'm not 100% sure. It just feels like the hand thing might be a red herring.

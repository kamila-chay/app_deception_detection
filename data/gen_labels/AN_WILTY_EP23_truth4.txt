Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. They're smiling a lot—like, a real, relaxed smile where their lips pull up and their eyes crinkle a bit—and they keep making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That usually feels like someone being open, not hiding something. I also notice they're raising their eyebrows a few times, which often happens when people are surprised or being genuine, like "wow, that's true!" instead of the kind of nervous twitch that sometimes happens when someone's lying.

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes people fake smiles when they're trying to seem nice or cover up a lie, right? Like, they might force a smile to seem confident. And I guess if they were lying, you'd expect them to look away more or fidget, but they don't seem to be doing that at all—no awkward pauses, no hands rubbing, nothing like that. Their body language just feels... calm. 

Still, I can see why someone might doubt it. Maybe the smile looks a little stiff? Or the eyebrow raises seem overdone? But honestly, from what I'm seeing, it doesn't *feel* like they're trying to hide anything. They're not avoiding eye contact, they're not nervous, and the way they're speaking seems natural. I mean, I've seen people lie with way more obvious signs—like looking down a lot or touching their face—but this feels different. 

So yeah, I'd say truth, but I'm not super confident. It's possible they're good at faking it, but the cues I'm seeing just don't match what I'd expect from a liar. Like, if they were lying, I'd probably notice more tension, but this just seems... relaxed. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but that's my gut feeling after watching it a couple times.

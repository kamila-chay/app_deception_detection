Watching the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit hard to say for sure just from this clip alone. What stands out to me is how calm they seem—no obvious signs of stress like frowning, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting. They're actually making steady eye contact most of the time ("gaze towards interlocutor" in the description), which usually leans toward truthfulness since liars often look away or seem distracted. But they do glance sideways occasionally, and their head tilts and turns a bit—like when someone's really listening or thinking, not necessarily hiding something. I've seen people do that while telling the truth when they're processing what they're saying.  

That said, I can't rule out lying entirely. Some people are naturally calm when they're lying—maybe they've practiced or they're not nervous by nature. And the head moving backward (like pulling away slightly) could *theoretically* be a sign of defensiveness, though it feels more like a natural head movement to me, not something forced. Also, the absence of nervous tells doesn't *prove* truth—it just means they're not showing the classic "liar's cues" we often expect. Like, I've heard that some cultures or personalities just don't exhibit those micro-expressions, so it might not mean anything.  

What makes me lean toward truth is how consistent their behavior is. No sudden shifts in expression, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed, no exaggerated gestures. They seem engaged, like they're genuinely trying to communicate. But I'm not 100% sure—liars can be really good at faking calm. If I had more context or more video, I'd feel better about it. For now, I'd say it *looks* like they're telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to call it definitive. It's just... the lack of red flags feels more telling than the presence of any "truth" signs. Still, I'd want to see more before I'd stake a claim on it.

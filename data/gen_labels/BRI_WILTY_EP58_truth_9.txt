Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while talking. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're speaking to, which feels intentional—not like they're avoiding looking at the camera or the person they're talking to. Their gaze is also up a bit, which I've heard sometimes means someone's thinking or recalling something, not necessarily being deceptive. Plus, they have this slight head tilt going on, which usually reads as engaged or curious to me—like they're really listening or trying to figure something out, not like they're hiding something.  

What stands out to me is how still they are otherwise. No fidgeting, no lip-biting, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck for words. Their chin actually moves *upward* a bit when they're speaking, which I think is different from the tense chin-jutting people sometimes do when they're nervous or lying. And they're not covering their mouth or hiding anything with their hands—just keeping their hands relaxed near their body, which feels natural.  

But I'm not 100% sure, honestly. I mean, some people are really good at faking calmness when they're lying—they might practice eye contact or avoid obvious tells. And that upward gaze could just be how they naturally think, not necessarily tied to truth. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any of the classic "nervous" signs, so the absence of those doesn't *prove* they're truthful. It just feels less likely they're lying *based on what I'm seeing*. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect at least a little more tension—maybe a flicker of a frown or a quick glance away. But here, it all just looks... steady.  

So yeah, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying too. Behavior alone can be tricky, but the lack of red flags here makes it seem like they're not trying to hide anything. Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it without more context.

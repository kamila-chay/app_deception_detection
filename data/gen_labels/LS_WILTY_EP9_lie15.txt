After watching the clip, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where the cues are kind of mixed up, and it's hard to pin down. On one hand, they're smiling (lip corners up) and keeping their arms open, which usually feels like someone trying to seem approachable or honest. They're also making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to, which I'd usually think is a sign of truthfulness—people who lie sometimes avoid eye contact, but not always. The head tilting and chin moving down might feel a bit off to me though; I've noticed in other videos that when people seem uncomfortable or are thinking hard, they'll do things like that, and it could hint at deception. The sideways glance they have feels a little odd too—some studies say people look sideways when lying, but honestly, I've seen people do that naturally when they're just thinking, so it might not mean much.  

But then again, the smile is pretty consistent, and they don't seem nervous—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of stress like frequent blinking or covering their mouth. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more signs of tension, like frowning or crossing arms, but they're not doing that. It could totally be that they're just a naturally expressive person who smiles a lot when they're relaxed, or maybe they're just thinking carefully about what they're saying. The arms open and head moving forward also feel like they're engaged and trying to connect, which doesn't scream "lying" to me.  

Honestly, it's tricky. The cues aren't pointing one way strongly enough. I'd lean toward them telling the truth because of the eye contact and open posture, but I can't rule out that the sideways glance and chin movement are just their way of processing, not deception. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe not lying, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—before I felt confident about it. It's easy to overread body language, so I'm keeping an open mind.

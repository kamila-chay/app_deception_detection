After watching the clip, I have some doubts about whether they're being completely truthful. While they do smile and maintain an open posture, which often suggests honesty, there are subtle signs that make me lean toward the possibility of deception. Their head tilting and chin movements strike me as slightly off; in other instances, such gestures can indicate discomfort or attempts to mask the truth. The sideways glance also feels somewhat unusual—although some people do this naturally when thinking, it can also be a hint of evasiveness. 

Even though they maintain steady eye contact and don’t show obvious nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, these calmer signs don’t fully convince me otherwise. Sometimes individuals can present an overly composed front when they’re not being truthful. The mix of seemingly honest gestures with less typical cues like the head and eye movements raises a red flag for me. 

I wouldn’t say it’s certain they’re lying, but given the combination of signals, I lean toward suspecting some level of deception. More context, especially about their words and tone, would definitely help clarify things, but based on what I’ve seen, I’d tentatively lean toward them not being entirely forthright.

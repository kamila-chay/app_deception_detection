This is a bit challenging to interpret solely from the video, but there are some signs that make me lean toward the possibility that the person might be deceptive. Their eyebrows are raised, which can indicate surprise or skepticism, yet they're also furrowed, suggesting concentration or stress. The smile they display seems somewhat forced—pulled up at the corners but not reaching the eyes, which often signals insincerity. Additionally, their head occasionally moves backward and tilts to the side, gestures that can be linked to discomfort or unease.

While they maintain steady eye contact and nod along, behaviors usually associated with honesty and engagement, the mixed signals from their facial expressions and subtle distancing gestures suggest some tension beneath the surface. The combination of a forced smile with furrowed brows feels a bit off, hinting they might be trying to mask something. Of course, people can show nervousness without being deceitful, and some do smile when anxious rather than genuinely happy.

Given these observations, I wouldn’t say they are definitively lying, but the cues do incline me to suspect that they might be less than truthful. It’s not a conclusive judgment, but I lean toward the idea that their body language subtly indicates they could be withholding or distorting the truth. Without more context, it's difficult to be certain, but the signs do point somewhat toward possible deception.

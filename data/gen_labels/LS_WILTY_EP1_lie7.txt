So I watched the clip a couple times, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I keep circling back to the same things that make me lean toward them not being fully truthful. Like, their arms were folded the whole time—like, really tight across their chest—and they kept tilting their head to the side, almost like they were trying to seem relaxed or engaged, but it felt a little forced. And their gaze... it kept darting down and sideways, not really meeting the other person's eyes much, which I’ve heard can happen when someone’s trying to think of what to say without seeming obvious. Their mouth looked kind of tight too, like the corners were pulled down a bit, which didn’t seem like a natural smile or anything. 

But then I keep second-guessing myself because, you know, people do fold their arms when they’re just cold or tired, and head tilting can be a sign of interest, not deception. Maybe they’re just shy or uncomfortable in the situation, not lying. The way they kept looking at the other person sometimes made me think they were trying to seem honest, which sometimes happens when people are nervous. And the sideways glances could just be them processing what they’re saying, not hiding something. 

Honestly, it’s hard to tell. The body language feels off in a way that makes me wonder, but I can’t rule out that they’re just having a bad day or aren’t used to being on camera. I’d say it’s *possible* they’re being deceptive, but I wouldn’t bet on it without more context. Like, if they’d been avoiding eye contact completely or fidgeting a lot, I’d be more sure, but this feels like a mix of things that could go either way. I’d probably ask them to clarify instead of jumping to conclusions.

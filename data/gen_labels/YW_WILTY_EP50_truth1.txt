Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, but I'll try to walk through it. So, the person seems to be looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—that's a good sign, right? Like, when people are being truthful, they often hold eye contact more naturally, whereas liars might avoid it or glance away a lot. But they do look down occasionally, which I've heard can sometimes be a sign of discomfort or lying, like they're not wanting to face the question. Still, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely, and they're not fidgeting or doing anything nervous—no weird blinking, no head-shaking that looks like a "no" (wait, they *are* shaking their head, but it's not clear if that's a "yes" or "no" gesture here).  

Head tilting is interesting—it usually feels like a sign of engagement or curiosity, like they're really listening, which doesn't scream "lying." And they're not smiling or frowning, which is a bit unusual for someone who's either stressed or trying to seem friendly. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe a forced smile or some awkwardness, but they just seem... calm. Like, they're just answering the question without overdoing it.  

But then again, I've heard some people are really good at lying without showing signs—they might be practiced or just not nervous about it. Maybe the head-shaking is a red herring? Like, if they're shaking their head to say "no" to something, but the video's context is them confirming something, it could be confusing. And that gaze down... sometimes people look down when they're recalling something honestly, not just when they're lying. Like, if you're trying to remember a detail, you might glance away.  

Honestly, though, the absence of all the classic "lying" cues—no sweating, no lip biting, no frantic movements—makes me lean toward them being truthful. Most of the time, when people are lying, they *do* show *some* physical sign, even if it's subtle. Here, it just feels... neutral. Like they're just being straightforward. I'm not 100% sure, but if I had to guess based on what I see, I'd say they're probably telling the truth. It's not like they're acting suspiciously, and the few things that *could* be off (like the gaze down) seem more like normal human behavior than deception. Still, I'd want to see more context to be sure—like what they're actually saying—but based on the body language alone? Yeah, I'm leaning truth.

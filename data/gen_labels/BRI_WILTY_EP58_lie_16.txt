Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn. The person seems to maintain pretty steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really focused on the person they're speaking to, which usually makes me think someone's being straightforward, not hiding something. But then there's that head shaking they do a few times, like a slow "no" motion while they're talking. That's the part that sticks out to me because it feels a little off. If they're just agreeing or emphasizing a point, it might make sense, but it's not the kind of head movement I'd expect if they were totally relaxed and truthful. It feels like maybe they're trying to push back on something without saying it outright.

On the flip side, though, I don't see any of the classic nervous tells—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird smiles or pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect them to seem more tense, like they're trying too hard to seem calm. But here, they seem pretty composed, just with that head shaking. Maybe the head shaking is just a habit, like how some people do it when they're thinking or being emphatic, and it's not actually related to lying at all. Like, maybe they're just naturally expressive with their head when they talk. I've known people who do that all the time, and it's nothing to do with deception.

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The steady gaze leans toward truth, but the head shaking is nagging at me. If I had to guess, I might lean toward them telling the truth because the rest of their body language seems so relaxed, but I can't shake that head shake—it feels intentional. Still, I'm not confident at all. It's possible they're just a very calm liar, or maybe the head shake is completely unrelated. I'd need to see more context or hear what they're actually saying to feel better about it. Right now, I'm just not sure.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because so much of what people assume about lying (like avoiding eye contact) doesn't always hold up. Here, they're actually maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor—and looking up a bit while they speak. That's interesting because I've heard people say liars look away, but research shows truth-tellers do that too, especially when thinking. So that alone doesn't scream "lying" to me.  

Their mouth is closed, and there are these awkward pauses—like they're pausing mid-sentence instead of rushing through it. Some might see that as nervousness, which people associate with lying, but it could just mean they're being careful with their words or genuinely thinking. The lips are retracted too, which looks a little tight or controlled, but not like a fake smile or frown. It just seems like they're holding their mouth still, maybe because they're focused.  

I keep wondering if the lack of other "tells" matters. No fidgeting, no excessive blinking, no head shaking or shrugging—none of the classic things people point to as signs of deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those micro-movements, but it's really calm. The gaze up thing still bugs me a little—some think that's a sign of fabrication—but I've read enough to know it's not reliable. Truth-tellers look up when recalling details too.  

On the flip side, could it just be that they're naturally quiet or reserved? Maybe they're not used to being on camera, so the pauses and tight lips are just their normal way of speaking, not deception. The "truth" label they mentioned might be right, but I can't be 100% sure just from this. It feels more like someone who's being deliberate and calm, which could go either way—truthful or just very practiced at hiding nerves.  

Honestly, I'd lean toward truth because the eye contact feels genuine and consistent, and there's no obvious stress signs. But I'd hesitate to say "definitely" because it's so easy to misread calmness as deception. If I had to guess? I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but it's not a slam dunk. The absence of red flags feels more telling than the few things that could be misinterpreted. Still, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying.

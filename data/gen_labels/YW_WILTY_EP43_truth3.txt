Honestly, it's kind of hard to say for sure just from watching, but here's what I'm noticing as I look at the clip. The person seems pretty calm while they're talking—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're speaking to, which feels like they're engaged rather than avoiding it. Their smile looks natural too, not forced or stiff, and they're tilting their head a little while they talk, which often just means they're listening or thinking, not necessarily trying to hide something. Plus, their hands are open, palms up, which usually reads as honest or non-defensive in body language. No fidgeting, no weird blinking, no signs of tension like furrowed brows. 

That said, I know some people can fake all of that—like, they might practice smiling or look you in the eye to seem trustworthy even when they're lying. And the head tilt could technically be a nervous habit for some folks, though it doesn't *feel* like that here. It's also possible they're just naturally relaxed, which would make them seem truthful without actually being deceptive. I guess the biggest thing is that all the cues I'd normally associate with lying—like avoiding eye contact, tense posture, or fake smiles—are completely absent. But yeah, I'm not going to claim I *know* for sure. It just... seems genuine to me based on what I'm seeing. Like, if I were in that conversation, I'd probably trust them more than not, but I'd still be cautious. It’s not 100% proof, but the absence of red flags makes it lean toward truth for me.

While it’s not definitive, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying based on what I observed. Their consistent avoidance of eye contact, with their gaze often fixed on the floor or something in front of them, struck me as unusual for a casual conversation and seemed to suggest discomfort, which can sometimes indicate deception. Additionally, the way they raised their eyebrows a few times gave off a sense of nervousness or an attempt to appear surprised, which could be a sign of being caught off guard or trying to mask the truth. 

That said, I’m aware these behaviors don’t guarantee dishonesty—people often look down when thinking or feeling shy, and eyebrow movements can simply be part of their natural expressiveness. It’s possible they were just stressed or uncomfortable with being recorded, not necessarily lying. Overall, I’m inclined to suspect a degree of deception given the combination of cues, but I wouldn’t say it’s certain without more context about their usual behavior or what exactly they were saying. It’s a subtle impression rather than a firm conclusion.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll share what stood out to me while watching. The person seemed to avoid eye contact a lot—they kept their gaze down, like they were focused on the floor or something in front of them instead of engaging with whoever was talking to them. That made me think maybe they were uncomfortable, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. I also noticed they raised their eyebrows a few times, almost like they were trying to seem surprised or maybe a bit nervous—like when someone's caught off guard. 

But then I started second-guessing myself because I've seen people look down when they're just thinking hard about what to say, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're shy or just not used to being recorded. And raising eyebrows? I've done that myself when I'm trying to sound convincing, even when I'm telling the truth. It's not a dead giveaway. Honestly, it could be a mix of things—maybe they're stressed about the situation, or they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows. 

I guess I'm leaning toward them not being completely truthful because the gaze down felt a bit too consistent for casual conversation, but I'm not confident at all. There's a good chance it's just their normal behavior. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe a slight chance of deception, but I'd need more context to be sure—like what they were actually saying or if they're usually this avoidant. It's really hard to tell just from the video alone.

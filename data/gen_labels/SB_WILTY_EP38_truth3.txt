Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "lie" or "truth" at me. Let me break down what I'm seeing in the video.

First, they're not doing the usual things people *think* liars do. No forced smiles, no weird laughing, no frowning like they're annoyed (the description says "scowl" is false, so it's not a full scowl, just eyebrows raised and furrowed). That's interesting because sometimes people expect liars to look tense, but here they seem... neutral? Actually, the eyebrows are doing this odd thing—raised *and* furrowed at the same time. I've seen that before when someone's genuinely trying to remember something or feels confused, not necessarily deceptive. Like when you're thinking hard about a detail and your forehead wrinkles while you're leaning in to focus.

Then there's the chin moving down—like they're looking down a bit while still making eye contact with whoever they're talking to. And they're nodding, which feels natural in conversation, not like a fake "yeah, I'm telling you" nod. The gaze shifting between up and down is common when people recall memories, right? Like they're mentally looking at something in their head. I don't see any of the classic red flags: no lip biting, no hands covering the mouth, no frantic blinking, no awkward pauses where they're just... stuck. The lack of those makes me lean toward them being honest. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those tells to pop up, especially if it's a stressful question.

But here's where I get unsure: the furrowed eyebrows *plus* raised ones. Could that be a sign of internal conflict? Like they're trying to suppress a reaction or feel uneasy about the topic? Maybe they're not lying, but they're uncomfortable with the question itself—like they know the truth but it's awkward to share. Or maybe it's just how they naturally look when concentrating. I've seen people do that when they're being very careful with their words, whether they're lying or not. And the chin moving down... sometimes that's a subtle sign of defensiveness, but it's so slight here, it could just be a normal head tilt while listening.

I guess what's making me hesitate is that there's no *obvious* sign of deception, which feels more like truth-telling. Liars often overcompensate or show micro-expressions, but this feels... quiet. Like they're just answering straightforwardly. But I can't rule out that the eyebrow thing is a hidden tell. Maybe they're lying but doing a really good job of hiding it. Still, the absence of the usual stuff—like no fidgeting, no gaze avoidance (they're looking at the person, even if shifting up/down)—makes me think it's more likely they're being truthful. It’s not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd probably say they're telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like the behavior of someone trying to hide something. But yeah, I'm not totally sure—I'd need to hear the actual words to be confident.

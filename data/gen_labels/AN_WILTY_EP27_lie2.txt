Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I've been watching this clip and it's kind of tricky. On one hand, the person is nodding a lot while they're talking, which usually feels like a sign of agreement or understanding—like they're genuinely engaging with what's being said. That makes me lean toward them being truthful, because liars sometimes overdo the nodding to seem more convincing. But then again, they're looking down quite a bit, not directly at the person they're talking to. I've heard that avoiding eye contact or looking down can be a red flag for deception, like when someone's uncomfortable or hiding something. But honestly, I've seen people look down all the time when they're just thinking or being shy, especially if they're not used to being on camera. It's not like they're avoiding the person entirely—they're still facing them, so it doesn't feel like a full avoidance. And there's no other obvious signs, like fidgeting or forced smiles, which makes me think it might just be their natural way of speaking. I guess I'm torn: the nodding feels honest, but the downward gaze gives me pause. Without more context about what they're saying, it's really hard to tell. I'd say it's possible they're being deceptive, but I wouldn't bet on it—could just be nervousness. I'd need to see more of the conversation to feel confident.

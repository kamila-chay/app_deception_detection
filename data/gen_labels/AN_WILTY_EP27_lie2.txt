After watching the clip carefully, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. While the frequent nodding could suggest agreement and engagement, it might also be an attempt to appear convincing, as some liars tend to overdo such gestures. More notably, the person often looks down rather than maintaining eye contact, which can be a subtle indication of discomfort or hiding something. Although looking down can sometimes just mean someone is shy or thinking, in this case, it feels a bit out of place and raises some doubts. There aren't clear signs of nervousness like fidgeting or forced smiles, which adds some ambiguity, but the combination of cues makes me lean more toward deception than honesty. Without additional context, I can’t be certain, but overall, I’m inclined to think the person may be leaning towards lying.

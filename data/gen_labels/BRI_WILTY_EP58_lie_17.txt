Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—not because they're perfect, but because their behavior doesn't match what I'd expect from someone lying. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which actually goes against the common idea that liars avoid eye contact. Instead, they're nodding along naturally, like they're engaged in the conversation, and their head is turning slightly sideways—maybe just a relaxed, attentive gesture, not something that screams "I'm hiding something." I don't see any of those classic "nervous" tells: no fidgeting, no excessive blinking, no awkward pauses where they're trying to think of a lie. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a few of those signs to pop up, like fidgeting with their hands or looking away more. But here, it just seems like someone who's listening and responding normally.  

That said, I know some people lie without showing obvious signs—maybe they're really practiced or just not nervous about it. And the head side-turn could be misinterpreted; sometimes people turn their head when they're thinking, which could happen whether they're lying or not. It's also possible the video is just a snippet, and they might have been lying earlier or later. But based *only* on what's in this clip, the lack of deception cues feels more consistent with honesty than deception. I’d say it's not a slam dunk, but it doesn't feel like lying to me. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth, but I’d want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

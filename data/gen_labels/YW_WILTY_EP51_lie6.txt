Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll share what stands out to me. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which actually feels a bit unusual if they were trying to hide something—most people who lie tend to look away or avoid eye contact, so that makes me wonder if they're being truthful. But then there's the head shaking—like, they're actively shaking their head "no" while speaking, and it feels a bit deliberate, almost like they're overemphasizing it to convince someone. I've seen that before where people do that when they're trying to sound firm about something they're not actually sure of.  

On the flip side, though, head shaking could just be a natural reaction to disagreeing with a question or statement, not necessarily lying. Maybe they genuinely disagree with what's being said, and the head shake is just part of that conversation. The way they're speaking doesn't seem rushed or tense either—no awkward pauses, no fidgeting, no weird smiles or frowns—and that could actually point to them being calm and truthful. Sometimes liars get nervous and start doing all those little tells, but here they seem pretty composed.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up for me. The eye contact leans toward truth, but the head shake feels like a potential red flag. I'd lean toward deception just because the head shake seems a bit too intentional for a simple disagreement, but I can totally see how someone else might think it's just them being emphatic. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're not being completely honest, but I'm not 100% sure—it's really subtle. Like, it could just be them saying "no" to a question without any ulterior motive. I'd need more context to feel confident.

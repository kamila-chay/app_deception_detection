This is a tough one, but I’m leaning toward thinking the person might be lying. They maintain direct eye contact, which some say liars avoid, but that’s not always reliable. Their head shaking and furrowed brows suggest a tense, almost defensive posture, as if they’re really trying to push back or hold something in. That kind of deliberate, repeated head shake and pronounced frown feels less like natural frustration and more like someone consciously controlling their expressions to sell a story. If they were telling the truth, I might expect them to be a bit more relaxed or even show some friendliness, but there’s none of that here. 

On the other hand, it’s possible they’re just genuinely annoyed or upset, and their composure could be due to focusing hard on this disagreement. They don’t fidget or show obvious signs of nervousness, which complicates things and means this isn’t clear-cut. Still, the overall impression is that the tension and control seem somewhat deliberate, pushing me to lean toward the idea that there’s some deception involved. Without more context, it’s hard to be sure, but based on these cues alone, I’m inclined to think they might not be fully truthful.

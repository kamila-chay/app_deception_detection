Hmm, this is a tough one. I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person seems to be talking to someone directly, and they're definitely looking them in the eye the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is true, so they're not avoiding eye contact, which sometimes people think liars do, but I've heard that's not always the case. They're also shaking their head a few times, like a firm "no" or disagreement, and their eyebrows are really furrowed, almost scowling. That frown feels tense, like they're either really frustrated or trying to hold something back.

On one hand, the direct eye contact and head shaking might actually feel like someone being defensive or insistent about something, which could fit with lying—like they're pushing back hard on a question they don't want to answer. The furrowed brows add to that tension, like they're concentrating really hard on keeping their story straight. If they were telling the truth, I might expect them to look a little more relaxed or maybe even smile a bit to seem friendly, but they're not smiling at all. 

But then, I'm second-guessing myself. Maybe they're just genuinely annoyed or confused about whatever they're being asked. Like, if someone's arguing with them or questioning something they genuinely disagree with, the head shake and frown could just be natural frustration, not deception. I've seen people get that intense when they're being honest but upset about a situation. And the fact that they're not fidgeting—no hand movements, no awkward pauses—makes it feel like they're trying to stay composed, which could go either way. Liars sometimes try to look calm, but so do people who are just stressed about the topic. 

I guess I'm leaning toward deception because the combination feels a bit too deliberate—like the head shake isn't casual, and that frown is really pronounced. But it's not a slam dunk. If I were guessing, I'd say it's possible they're lying, but I'd need more context. Like, what are they even talking about? If it's a simple "no" to a harmless question, the tension might just be overblown. But if it's something sensitive, the way they're holding themselves... yeah, it makes me wonder. Still, I can't be 100% sure. It feels like they're trying to project confidence, but sometimes that's just how people act when they're nervous about being accused of something they didn't do. Honestly, it's one of those clips where you'd want to see the whole conversation to really tell.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. The way they're sitting with their arms open and keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to feels really genuine—like they're not trying to shut anything off or hide. I've noticed that when people are being deceptive, they often close off their body language, like crossing arms or looking away, but here they're actually leaning in with arms open, which usually suggests openness. The raised eyebrows are a bit tricky—they could mean surprise or skepticism, but since they're looking directly at the person and not avoiding eye contact, it doesn't feel like a sign of lying to me. It just seems like they're processing what's being said or maybe a little taken aback, not nervous about lying.

That said, I can see why someone might question it. The head shaking is a little confusing—I wonder if it's a habitual gesture, like they do that when they're thinking, or if it's meant to say "no" to something. Sometimes people shake their head when they're lying to seem emphatic, but in this case, it's happening during a conversation where they're clearly engaged. Also, the lack of any obvious nervous ticks—no fidgeting, no forced smiles, no awkward pauses—makes me think they're not stressed about the truth. But I know body language isn't foolproof; some people get really calm when lying, and others get extra expressive when they're honest. So yeah, I'm not completely certain, but all the cues I'm seeing point more toward truth than deception. It's hard to say for sure without more context, but based on this clip alone, I'd guess they're being truthful.

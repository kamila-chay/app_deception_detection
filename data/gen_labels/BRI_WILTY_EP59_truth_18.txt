Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's not super clear-cut. What stands out to me is how they're reacting to the question—like when they raised their eyebrows, almost like they were genuinely surprised by what they were being asked. That feels more like a real "wait, that's not what I meant" reaction than something someone would fake if they were lying. And the shrug they did? It seemed kind of natural, like they were just saying "I don't know" or "I'm not sure," not like they were trying to cover up something. Their eyes also stayed mostly on the person asking the question, which usually leans toward truth-telling, though they did glance down and sideways a few times—those could be normal when thinking, not necessarily avoiding eye contact.

But here's where I start doubting myself: sometimes people who lie *do* fake surprise or shrug to seem casual, so that raised eyebrow could just be part of their act. And the downward glance? To some people, that screams "they're hiding something," even though research says it's often just someone processing thoughts. I also notice they didn't smile or laugh at all, which might mean they're tense (which could mean lying), but it could also just mean they're serious or uncomfortable with the topic—like maybe it's a heavy question they're answering honestly. 

Honestly, the more I watch, the less I'm convinced it's a lie. The lack of nervous tells like fidgeting or forced smiles makes it feel more like they're just being straightforward, even if they're not super animated. But I can't rule out that the shrug or the eyebrow raise is rehearsed. It’s easy to overthink nonverbal cues, and I’ve definitely been fooled before by people who seem calm but are lying. So yeah, I’m leaning toward truth because it all feels... unforced? But I’d want to see more context or hear the actual words to be sure. It’s not a clear "yes" or "no," but it doesn’t scream "liar" to me.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure this out. The person seems to be answering a question directly, but there's something off about how they're moving. They're smiling a bit, but it feels... tight? Like they're forcing it to seem friendly, especially when they're talking about something that might be awkward. Their eyebrows are raised a lot too—like they're surprised or trying to seem innocent, which I've heard can happen when people are covering something up. And that mouth opening? It's way exaggerated, like they're overdoing the "I'm being honest" look. Their chin also keeps jutting up like they're trying to hold themselves together, and they keep glancing down while they talk instead of looking straight at the person asking the question. That side-to-side head tilt feels nervous, not relaxed.

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just naturally expressive. Some people smile and raise their eyebrows a lot when they're trying to be polite or calm themselves down. The exaggerated mouth could just be how they talk—like they're used to speaking with big gestures. And the gaze down? Could be they're thinking hard, not hiding something. I've seen people look away when they're genuinely stressed about a topic, not because they're lying. The chin movement might even be a habit, like they're just tapping into a nervous tic they've always had. 

Honestly, it's tough. The cues *do* lean toward deception—smile that doesn't quite reach the eyes, over-the-top mouth, avoiding direct eye contact—but none of them are 100% proof. It could easily be someone who's just really anxious about the question, not lying. I'd lean toward deception based on what I'm seeing, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. Like, if this was a real interview, I'd want more context before I'd be sure. It feels like they're trying too hard to seem normal, but maybe "normal" for them is just... a little too much. Still, I can't rule out it's just their natural way of talking. Gotta say, it's a maybe.

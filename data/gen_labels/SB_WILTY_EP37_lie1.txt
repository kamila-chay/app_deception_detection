Watching the clip, I get the sense that the person might not be entirely truthful. They answer the question directly, but their body language raises some doubts. The smile seems a bit forced, almost like they're trying too hard to appear friendly while discussing something potentially uncomfortable. Their raised eyebrows come across as an attempt to look surprised or innocent, which can sometimes be a sign of hiding something. The exaggerated opening of their mouth feels like an overdone effort to convince others of their honesty. Their chin jutting up repeatedly and the avoidance of direct eye contact—looking down instead—suggest a struggle to maintain composure. Even the side-to-side head tilt strikes me as more nervous than relaxed.

Of course, it's possible they are just highly expressive or anxious. Some people naturally use big gestures and avoid eye contact when under stress, so these behaviors aren’t definitive proof of lying. Still, taken together, these cues lean me toward thinking deception is more likely. The signs—forced smile, exaggerated mouth movements, and avoidance of eye contact—make me suspicious, even though none conclusively prove dishonesty. Without additional context, I can’t be certain, but my impression is that they’re probably not telling the whole truth.

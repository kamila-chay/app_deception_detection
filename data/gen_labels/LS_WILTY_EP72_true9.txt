Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure—body language can be tricky. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels more natural when someone's being genuine, especially since they're not darting their gaze away or looking down like they might be avoiding something. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which often shows surprise or engagement rather than deception, and their lips are turned up slightly—like they're genuinely reacting to what's being said, not forcing a smile. There's no frowning, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck, and they're not doing those little nervous tells like touching their face or rubbing their hands.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're skeptical or even when they're lying—they might be trying to seem surprised to cover up a false story. And that slight lip curl could technically be a fake smile, though it doesn't feel forced to me. I've seen people who are really nervous (not necessarily lying) still look like they're hiding something because they're so tense. Like, maybe they're just uncomfortable in the moment, not dishonest.  

Honestly, the absence of the usual "lying" signs—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that stiff "smile" where only the lips move—makes it feel more honest to me. But I wouldn't bet my life on it. If I had to guess based on what's happening right now, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the full context to be sure. It just doesn't *feel* like someone who's hiding something.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems a bit tense while answering. Their eyebrows are furrowed like they're concentrating hard or maybe frustrated, and they're raising them a couple of times too—almost like they're reacting to something unexpected in the question. I've noticed people do that when they're trying to recall details or feel a bit thrown off, but it could also be a sign they're not comfortable. They're not making eye contact either, which sometimes people do when they're being evasive, but honestly, I've seen a lot of people avoid eye contact even when they're being completely honest—maybe they're just shy or the lighting's bad.  

What makes me lean toward them being truthful, though, is how calm the rest of their body is. No fidgeting, no covering their mouth, no weird head movements or excessive blinking like you'd see in someone trying to hide something. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little nervous tells, but here it's mostly just that brow thing. Maybe they're just genuinely stressed about the topic, not lying. But I'm not totally sure—I could easily be wrong. Like, maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show those signs, or maybe they're just naturally expressive with their face. It's tricky because people frown for all sorts of reasons, and without knowing the context, it's hard to say. Honestly, I'd say it's closer to truth than lie, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It feels like they're being real, but I can't rule out they might be hiding something subtle.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together if this person seems truthful or not. Honestly, it's tricky because body language isn't always a perfect tell. What stands out to me is how they're holding their gaze—they're consistently looking directly at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of engagement or honesty. People who are lying sometimes avoid eye contact, so that makes me lean toward them being genuine. They also nod a few times while speaking, which often feels like natural agreement or emphasis, not something you'd do if you were trying to cover up a lie.  

But here's where I hesitate: raised eyebrows can sometimes mean someone's skeptical or even *thinking* about what they're saying, not necessarily that they're being truthful. I've seen people raise their brows when they're trying to seem surprised or innocent, like they're overcompensating. And while the direct gaze is reassuring, I've also heard that some liars *force* themselves to make more eye contact to seem sincere, so it's not a hard rule. The fact that they're not fidgeting or looking away a lot is good, but it could just mean they're calm or rehearsed, not necessarily truthful.  

Honestly, the absence of nervous tells—no frowning, no lip-biting, no awkward pauses—makes it feel less like they're hiding something. If they were lying, I might expect more physical tension, like scratching or avoiding the gaze. But then again, some people are just naturally calm under pressure, or they've practiced their story so much it feels effortless. I'm not going to say for sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it *feels* like they're being honest. It’s not a slam-dunk, though—there are plausible reasons the cues could be misleading. I’d probably say "truth" if I had to guess, but I’d still want to hear the full context to be sure.

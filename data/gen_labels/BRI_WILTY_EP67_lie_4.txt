Based on what I'm seeing in the video, while the person’s palms are up—a gesture often interpreted as open and honest—their consistent sideways gaze raises some doubts. Avoiding direct eye contact is commonly linked with discomfort or evasiveness, which can sometimes suggest they might be hiding something. Although avoiding eye contact could be due to cultural reasons or personal habits, in this context it makes me lean slightly toward the idea that they might not be fully truthful.

The fact that they’re calm, not fidgeting, and not displaying overt signs of nervousness complicates things, as these are typical indicators people look for when assessing deception. Yet, the lack of these "classic" tells along with the sideways glance somewhat clashes, making me suspect that the person could be deliberately controlling their behavior to appear genuine.

The palms-up gesture might be a conscious attempt to appear trustworthy rather than a natural sign of honesty. While I can't be certain, the combination of subtle avoidance in eye contact combined with controlled, open-handed gestures leads me to lean more towards the possibility that they are not being entirely truthful, even if the evidence is not definitive.

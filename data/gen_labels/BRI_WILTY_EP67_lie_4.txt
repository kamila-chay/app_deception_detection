Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if this person is lying or not. They're sitting there with their palms up, which usually feels like an open, honest gesture to me—like they're trying to seem approachable or truthful. But then their gaze is consistently sideways, not directly at whoever they're talking to, which I've always been trained to associate with someone avoiding eye contact. That part makes me lean toward "maybe they're hiding something," especially since I've heard that people often look away when they're not being truthful.

But here's where it gets tricky. I've also read that avoiding eye contact isn't a reliable sign of lying—it could just be their natural way of thinking, or maybe they're from a culture where direct eye contact is considered rude. And the palms-up thing? That's actually the opposite of what you'd expect if someone's nervous or deceptive; it's usually seen as a "I'm being genuine" signal. They're not fidgeting, not touching their face, not smiling unnaturally—none of the classic "tells" are there. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs, like shaky hands or a forced laugh, but they're just sitting there, calm, with that sideways look and open palms.

Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think the sideways gaze might be a red herring. Maybe they're just distracted by something off-camera, or they're trying to remember details without seeming too intense. The palms up makes me wonder if they're actually trying to seem trustworthy, which could mean they're telling the truth but are just nervous about the situation. I guess I'd be hesitant to call it deception based on this alone—I'd want more context, like what they're even talking about or how they're reacting to questions. It feels like a case where my gut says "maybe," but the actual cues are all over the place, so I can't really commit to either side. I'd probably say "I don't have enough to go on" rather than guessing.

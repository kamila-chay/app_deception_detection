Looking at this clip, I'd say it's really hard to call for sure, but I'm leaning toward the person being a bit off—maybe not outright lying, but definitely not fully comfortable. I noticed they're raising their eyebrows a lot, which often feels like they're trying to seem engaged or surprised, but it comes off a bit forced when paired with the frequent blinking. Like, they're staring at the person they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor), which is good, but then they keep looking down instead of holding eye contact, and their head's tilted like they're listening intently. That head tilt is a bit odd though—usually it's a sign of curiosity, but here it feels like they're trying too hard to seem attentive.  

The blinking stands out the most. I've seen people blink like that when they're stressed or thinking up an answer, but it could also just be dry eyes or nervous energy unrelated to lying. And honestly, the fact they're not smiling or frowning at all makes me wonder if they're just being overly cautious—maybe they're trying not to give anything away, which *could* point to deception. But then again, some people just have neutral expressions naturally, or they might be in a serious situation where they're not supposed to react. I've known people who get super quiet and look down when they're just concentrating on answering a tough question, not lying.  

The other thing is the gaze down—some folks think avoiding eye contact means lying, but I've heard it can mean the opposite (like when someone's processing info deeply). Here, they're still looking *at* the person, just not directly, so it might just be hesitation, not deception. If they'd been avoiding eye contact entirely, that'd be a bigger red flag.  

Honestly, I'd say it's a maybe. The cues *could* fit deception, but they're not super clear-cut. It’s the kind of thing where if I knew more context—like what they were talking about or how they usually act—I'd feel more sure. Right now, I’m not confident enough to say "yes, they're lying," but I’d be suspicious enough to ask follow-up questions. It’s tricky because so many behaviors overlap with stress, shyness, or just bad lighting in the video. Maybe they’re just having a bad day.

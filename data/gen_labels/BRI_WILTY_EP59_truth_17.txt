Watching the clip, I'm really trying to get a sense of whether they're being truthful here. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "lie" or "truth" at me. They're not fidgeting with their hands, which I'd usually see if someone was nervous about lying—no rubbing, scratching, or covering their face. That feels like a point in their favor, like they're relaxed. Their eyes are mostly focused on the person they're talking to, which is good, but they also look down a few times. I've heard people say looking down can be a sign of lying to avoid eye contact, but I also know some people just naturally look down when they're thinking or being thoughtful, especially if they're trying to recall something. So I'm not sure if that down gaze is a red flag or just how they process things.

Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which can sometimes signal surprise or skepticism—like they're genuinely reacting to what they're saying or hearing. And the lip corners are slightly up, like a tiny, quiet smile. It doesn't look forced or exaggerated, which is different from when someone tries to fake a smile when they're lying. If it was a fake smile, it might feel tighter or more fixed, but this seems soft. They also tilt their head a little while speaking, which usually feels like they're engaged or curious, not defensive. That makes me lean toward them being genuine.

But here's where I hesitate: if they *were* lying, they might be trying *too* hard to seem calm and engaged, so the lack of nervous tells could actually be a cover. Like, they're suppressing their anxiety to look truthful. And the raised eyebrows—could that be a sign they're trying to seem interested or agreeable to make their story stick? I'm not sure. I'd want to see more context, like what they're actually saying, because without that, it's hard to tell if the behavior matches the content. 

All in all, the absence of classic "lie" signs (like fidgeting, avoiding gaze, fake smiles) makes it feel more like they're telling the truth, but I can't rule out that they're just a really good actor. I'd be hesitant to call it a lie based on this alone, but I also wouldn't say for certain they're truthful. It just feels... neutral. Like they're speaking calmly and naturally, which often happens when people are honest, but it's not definitive. Hard to say for sure without more to go on.

Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the video alone, but here's how I'm reading it. The person isn't smiling or laughing, which might make some people think they're hiding something, but actually, they look pretty tense—like their lips are pulled down and kind of pinched, and their chin is sort of tucked in a little. They're also looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to be honest, and not avoiding eye contact like I'd expect if they were lying. I notice they're not fidgeting either—no hand rubbing, no weird blinking, nothing like that. That usually makes me lean toward truth because liars often get nervous and do those little tells.  

But then again, I wonder if the way they're looking down sometimes could be a sign they're not comfortable with what they're saying. Like, maybe they're just sad or thinking hard about it, not necessarily lying. I've seen people look down when they're being truthful about something tough, so it's not a clear "lie" signal. And the lack of smiling feels more like they're serious about whatever they're talking about, not like they're trying to hide something.  

Honestly, it's hard to tell without hearing the words, but based on the body language alone, I'd probably lean toward them being truthful. The absence of classic "lying" cues (like avoiding eyes or fidgeting) stands out more than the few subtle signs of tension. But I'm not 100% sure—sometimes people who are lying can be really good at not showing it, or the tension could just be from stress. I’d say it's more likely truth than lie, but I’d want to hear the actual conversation to be confident.

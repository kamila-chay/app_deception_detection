Looking at this clip, I’m honestly a bit torn. On one hand, the person’s body language seems pretty open—arms are wide open, palms up, and they’re making consistent eye contact with the person they’re talking to, which usually feels like a sign of someone being straightforward. They’re also laughing, which often comes across as genuine when someone’s sharing something they’re comfortable with. That laughter, combined with the open gestures, makes me lean toward them being truthful—it feels like they’re engaged and not hiding anything.  

But then there’s the hands rubbing thing. I’ve noticed people do that when they’re nervous or trying to calm themselves down, and that’s a cue that sometimes pops up when someone’s not being fully honest. Also, the description says they’re not actually smiling (smile is false), but their lip corners are pulled up a bit—like they’re trying to smile but it’s not quite reaching their eyes. That’s the kind of thing that can feel a little forced, like they’re putting on a mask for the camera.  

I guess the big question is whether the hands rubbing is just them being naturally anxious (maybe they’re in an awkward situation, not lying) or a sign of deception. And the laughter—could that be a way to deflect or seem relaxed while they’re actually nervous? It’s hard to say without knowing what they’re talking about. Sometimes people laugh when they’re stressed, not just when they’re happy.  

Honestly, though, the open posture and eye contact feel stronger to me. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of avoidance—like looking away a lot or crossing arms—but here they’re leaning in, palms up, and staying focused. The hands rubbing might just be a habit or general nerves, not a direct clue about lying. I’m not 100% sure, but I’d probably go with them telling the truth, even if it’s a bit of a gut call. It just doesn’t *feel* like deception to me, even with those little red flags. But yeah, it’s definitely not a slam dunk—could easily be the other way around.

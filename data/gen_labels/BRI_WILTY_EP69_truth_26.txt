Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that nervous energy people often associate with lying. They're actually looking directly at whoever they're talking to, which feels like it might lean toward truthfulness, since liars sometimes avert their gaze. But then they're shaking their head a bit, which I've seen people do naturally when they're disagreeing or just processing something, not necessarily when they're lying. Like, maybe they're just saying "no" to something or reacting to a point being made, not trying to hide anything.

What stands out is how still they are otherwise—no raised eyebrows like they're surprised, no frowning, no lip biting or anything. The description says their eyebrows are raised, but in the video, it just looks like a natural expression, maybe a bit of skepticism or curiosity, not the kind of "oh, I'm nervous" eyebrow raise I've heard about. And they're not touching their face or rubbing their hands, which are common tells people think mean lying, but I've read that those aren't reliable indicators. Sometimes people do those things when they're just thinking hard, not lying.

On the other hand, I wonder if the head shaking could be a sign. Like, if they're shaking their head "no" to something, maybe they're trying to deny it, which would be a lie. But it's not a big, dramatic shake—it's subtle, and they're still looking at the person, so it feels more like part of the conversation than a defensive move. Also, the fact that they're not smiling or acting overly friendly makes me think they're not trying to be extra convincing, which sometimes happens when people are lying. Like, if they were making up a story, they might try to seem more engaged or smile to seem trustworthy, but here they're just... neutral. 

But yeah, I can't rule out the head shake as a potential tell. Maybe it's just how they talk, or maybe they're genuinely disagreeing with something. And honestly, people who lie can be really calm too—like, they've practiced or they're not nervous. So it's hard to say for sure. I guess my gut says it's probably truth because of the steady eye contact and lack of other nervous habits, but I'm not 100% sure. Like, maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe the head shake is a red herring. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more certain, but based on the body language alone, it seems like they're being straightforward. Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it—human behavior is way too messy for that.

Hmm, looking at this clip... honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty tense in the way they're holding their face—there's that tight frown and eyebrows pulled down, like they're really focused on something that's bothering them. I noticed they didn't make eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which makes me wonder if they're avoiding the question. People often say liars look away, right? But then again, I've seen a lot of people frown like that when they're just frustrated or confused, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're upset about the topic itself—maybe they're being asked something they don't want to answer, and that's why they're scowling instead of being defensive.  

Also, they don't seem to be doing any of the classic "nervous" things we usually associate with lying—no blinking a lot, no fidgeting with their hands, nothing like that. If they were lying, I'd expect some of those signs, but they're just... still. Which makes me think maybe they're not lying, just really annoyed. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so the lack of obvious tells might actually mean they're trying too hard to seem calm. It's tricky.  

I guess my gut says it's possible they're not being truthful because of the frown and avoiding eye contact, but I can't rule out that they're just genuinely upset or stressed about whatever they're discussing. Like, if someone asked me a really personal question I didn't want to answer, I might scowl and look away too—doesn't mean I'm lying, just that I'm not happy about the situation. Without knowing the context of the conversation, it's really hard to tell. I'd lean toward deception just because of the way they're reacting, but I'm not at all certain. It feels like one of those cases where the behavior could go either way depending on what's actually being said.

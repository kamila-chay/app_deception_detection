Looking at this clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a puzzle. The thing that stands out most is how they're actually making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—like, they're not avoiding it at all. That's interesting because I've heard so much about liars avoiding eye contact, but sometimes the opposite happens. They might stare a bit harder to seem honest, or maybe they're just really focused on the conversation. They're also nodding along, which feels natural for someone engaged in a discussion, not like a forced "yes" to cover up something. 

But then there's that sideways glance they keep making—like, they'll look directly at the other person, then flick their eyes off to the side for a second. I wonder if that's just them thinking or maybe a nervous habit, but it's not like they're avoiding eye contact entirely. It's hard to tell if that's a sign of deception or just how they naturally move their eyes. And honestly, the whole thing feels... calm? Like they're not fidgeting, not touching their face, not blinking a lot—none of the classic "tells" people expect. If they were lying, I'd expect to see more of that, right? But maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not lying at all. 

On the flip side, though, I keep thinking: what if that sideways glance *is* the sign? I've read some stuff where people glance away when they're fabricating stories, even if they're looking at the person otherwise. And the nodting—could that be a little too eager? Like, they're trying to seem cooperative. But the description says it's just "nod," not "exaggerated nod," so I shouldn't assume that. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The eye contact and lack of nervous gestures lean toward them being truthful, but the sideways glances give me pause. I guess in real life, I'd probably ask for more context—like, what's the conversation about?—because without that, it's easy to misread. Right now, I'm leaning a little more toward them telling the truth because they seem relaxed and engaged, but I can't rule out deception entirely. It's just... not clear-cut. Like, if I had to guess, I'd say maybe not lying, but I'd definitely want to see more of the video to be sure.

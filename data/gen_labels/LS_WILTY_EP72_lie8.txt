From what I can see in the video, the person is maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—looking directly at them the whole time without glancing away. That’s the most noticeable thing. Normally, when people are lying, I’d expect them to avoid eye contact, fidget, or show some nervousness like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. But here, they’re just sitting there, calm, making consistent eye contact, and not doing any of those things we usually associate with deception. It feels... unnervingly relaxed for someone who might be lying. 

But then I think, maybe they’re just really good at it? Like, some people practice lying so much they don’t show any physical tells at all—they’re not fidgety, they don’t look away, they’re just... smooth. And honestly, I don’t know the context of the conversation. Maybe they’re telling the truth about something they’re completely sure of, which would explain why they’re not nervous. Or maybe they’re lying about something they’ve rehearsed so well that it feels natural to them. 

I also wonder if the lack of other behaviors—no raised eyebrows, no awkward pauses, no lip movements—could actually be a red flag. Sometimes liars overcompensate by being *too* composed. But then again, the opposite could be true: if they were lying and nervous, I’d expect to see *something*, like hands rubbing or fidgeting. The fact that there’s *nothing* makes it hard to pin down. 

Honestly, it’s tricky. My gut says the steady eye contact and calmness lean toward truthfulness, but I can’t rule out that they’re just a very skilled liar. Without knowing what they’re saying or the situation, it’s almost impossible to be sure. I’d hesitate to call it a lie just based on this clip—it feels more like they’re just a naturally calm person, but I’d want more context before I’d feel confident either way.

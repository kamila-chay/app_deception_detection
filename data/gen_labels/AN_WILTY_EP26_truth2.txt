Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not 100% sure. The person seems pretty tense, right? They've got this scowl on their face and their eyebrows are raised, which feels like they're either really frustrated or maybe genuinely upset about what they're saying. But then they're making direct eye contact with whoever's talking to them—that usually makes me think they're being honest, since liars often avoid that. Still, they keep looking down a bit, which could be nervousness, but I've seen people do that even when they're telling the truth, especially if they're thinking hard or just uncomfortable in the moment.  

The head side-turning is a bit confusing too—it's not the classic "head shake" for denial, but turning the head sideways can sometimes signal hesitation or discomfort. But here, they're not shaking their head or doing anything else fidgety like rubbing hands or covering their mouth, which are more common "lie" cues. So the absence of those things actually makes me lean toward them being genuine, but I'm not sure. Maybe they're just naturally expressive when they're upset, and the scowl is just their reaction to the topic, not the lie itself.  

On the flip side, I could see someone lying while still looking at you and keeping their head still—they might be trying *too* hard to seem calm. But the way they're holding their gaze down occasionally feels like they're not avoiding it, just... processing. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, like quick blinking or shifting around, but they're not doing any of that. It just seems like they're in a bad mood about whatever they're talking about, not necessarily hiding something.  

Honestly, though, I'm really not confident. Behavior alone is such a messy clue—it could be their normal way of reacting to questions, or it could be nerves. Without knowing the context of the conversation, it's hard to tell if the scowl is about the topic or about being questioned. I'd probably say "truth" based on the lack of classic deception signs, but I'd still be second-guessing it. Like, maybe they're lying but they're really good at controlling their body language, or maybe they're just angry and that's why they're not smiling. It's just... hard to pin down.

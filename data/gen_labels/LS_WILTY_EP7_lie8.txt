Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning towards the idea that they might be lying, though I’m not entirely certain. The frequent eyebrow raising and rapid blinking stand out, as these behaviors are often associated with stress or deception, possibly indicating that the person is trying to fabricate something. Their mouth remains closed with awkward pauses, and their lips appear to be pulled in or pushed out in an unusual way, which could suggest an attempt to control their facial expressions. Additionally, the repeated head tilting and backward movements come across as somewhat defensive, as if they're mentally distancing themselves from the conversation. The absence of smiles or laughter further supports the notion that they might not be comfortable or relaxed, which might align with deceptive behavior.

On the other hand, they maintain eye contact for most of the interaction, which is typically not what you'd expect from someone who is lying. There are no obvious physical tells like covering the mouth or fidgeting. The awkward pauses might simply reflect careful thinking, especially if the subject matter is sensitive. Head tilting can also be a natural listening gesture rather than a definitive sign of deceit. This leaves some room for the possibility that their nervousness is genuine anxiety about the situation rather than an attempt to hide the truth.

Still, given the combination of eyebrow raising, frequent blinking, and defensive gestures, I find myself inclined to suspect deception, even if it’s not a definitive conclusion. The lack of certain classic signs tempers my confidence, but overall, the cues here seem to lean more towards the person possibly being untruthful, though I’d feel more comfortable making a stronger judgment with additional context about what they were asked or the situation they’re in.

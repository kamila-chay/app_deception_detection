Looking at the clip, I’m honestly not entirely sure if they’re lying or not—it’s one of those situations where the cues are kind of mixed up. On one hand, they’re raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking really frequently, which I’ve heard is sometimes linked to stress or deception, like when someone’s trying to fabricate something. Their mouth’s closed with these awkward pauses too, and the lips are kind of pulled in or pushed out in a way that feels off—like they’re trying to control their expression. Plus, they keep tilting their head sideways and moving it backward, which seems a bit defensive, almost like they’re mentally stepping away from the conversation. That makes me lean toward deception, especially since they’re not smiling or laughing at all, which you’d expect if they were relaxed.

But then there’s the other side: they’re actually looking at the person they’re talking to most of the time, not avoiding eye contact, and they’re not doing any obvious "tells" like covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands. I’ve read that avoiding eye contact is a common lie sign, but here they’re making eye contact—just not directly, maybe because they’re nervous. The awkward pauses could just mean they’re thinking hard about what to say, which happens when people are being truthful but need to choose words carefully, especially if it’s a sensitive topic. And the head tilting? That’s often just a natural gesture when someone’s listening or processing, not necessarily a sign of lying. Honestly, I’m second-guessing myself because the nervousness could easily be from anxiety about the situation—like maybe they’re in an interview or being questioned—and not because they’re hiding something. 

So yeah, I’m stuck between "they might be lying" and "they’re just really stressed." The blinking and eyebrows feel like red flags, but the eye contact and lack of other classic signs (like fidgeting or fake smiles) make me think it’s not a slam dunk. I’d probably say *maybe* deception, but I’d feel way more confident if I knew the context—like what they were being asked about. Without that, it’s really hard to call, and I’d hate to jump to conclusions.

This is a bit complicated, but leaning on what I see, I’m somewhat inclined to think the person might be deceiving. At first glance, they appear calm without obvious signs like smiling or laughing, which doesn't rule out lying but is worth noting. What draws my attention more are the frequent blinks—significantly more than usual—and their consistently raised eyebrows, which can sometimes indicate someone is trying to seem innocent or engaged, but can also mean they’re genuinely processing their thoughts. 

The increased blinking could suggest stress or cognitive load, both of which might point toward deception, though nervousness from being in an interview-like setting could explain it too. Their eye movements are a bit mixed—looking up and sideways as if recalling memories, but also maintaining eye contact rather than avoiding it, which might suggest they’re attempting to appear truthful while thinking carefully. 

That said, the combination of raised eyebrows and heavy blinking feels somewhat unnatural for a relaxed conversation. You’d expect more natural expressions, maybe a small smile, if they were comfortable and honest. The stiff look and lack of relaxed facial movements give the impression of someone holding something back. Of course, this could be a serious person or a tense situation, so those signs alone aren’t definitive. 

Taking it all in, I lean towards the possibility that they’re not fully truthful, mainly due to that unusual mix of facial cues and blinking patterns that seem inconsistent with a straightforward recounting. Still, without hearing their actual words or more context, I can’t be certain—it's just that the signs nudge me slightly in the direction of deception, even if nerves or stress might be equally plausible explanations.

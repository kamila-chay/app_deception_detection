Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty calm at first glance, no obvious smiling or laughing, which sometimes happens when people are being deceptive, but not always. What stands out to me is how often they're blinking—like, a lot more than normal. And their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem engaged. 

I know raised eyebrows can sometimes signal deception, like they're trying to appear open or innocent, but it could also just mean they're genuinely processing what they're saying or reacting to something. The blinking makes me pause too—people blink more when they're stressed or thinking hard, which could be because they're lying, but it could also just be because they're nervous in the situation, like maybe they're being interviewed and that's making them tense. 

Then there's the way they're looking around—glancing up a bit (which I've heard people do when recalling memories), sideways sometimes, but also keeping their gaze on the person they're talking to. That seems a bit mixed. If they were lying, I might expect them to avoid eye contact more, but they're not really avoiding it, they're just shifting it. That actually feels a bit more like someone trying to seem honest while they're thinking. 

On the other hand, the constant raised eyebrows and blinking *do* feel a bit off for a relaxed conversation. If they were just telling the truth and feeling comfortable, I'd expect more natural facial expressions, maybe even a small smile. The lack of any smile or relaxed mouth movements feels a bit stiff, like they're holding something back. But then again, maybe they're just a very serious person, or the situation is tense for other reasons. 

I guess the thing that keeps me leaning slightly toward deception is the combination—those two things together (raised brows + heavy blinking) don't feel like the natural way someone would act when they're just telling a straightforward story. But I'm really not sure. It could easily be just them being anxious about the question, not lying. I'd need to hear the actual words they're saying to be more confident. Right now, it feels like maybe they're being a bit guarded, but I can't rule out it's just nerves. Honestly, I'd hesitate to call it a lie without more context. It's probably not a clear-cut case either way.

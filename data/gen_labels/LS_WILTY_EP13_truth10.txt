Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. At first glance, the way they're moving their head—nodding and turning it sideways—seems like they're trying to be engaged, which might suggest they're being honest. But then there's that constant scratching of their head and touching their face, which I've noticed before when people are nervous or trying to hide something. Their lips are pulled down at the corners too, which feels like a subtle sign of discomfort, not like a relaxed or happy expression. And they're not looking directly at whoever's talking to them—they keep glancing down or to the side, which sometimes happens when someone's avoiding eye contact because they're not being truthful.  

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just naturally anxious or shy in front of the camera. I've seen people fidget and avoid eye contact without lying—they might just be uncomfortable with being recorded, or maybe they're stressed about the topic. The raised eyebrows could also mean they're genuinely surprised by what's being said, not that they're fabricating something. And the nodding—while it *can* be a sign of deception (like they're overcompensating to seem agreeable)—also feels like they're actually listening or trying to be polite.  

Honestly, it's a tough call. The cues point both ways: the physical signs of stress (scratching, gaze shifts) lean toward deception, but the context could just be them being nervous. Without knowing what they're talking about or how they usually act, it's hard to say. I wouldn't bet money on them lying, but I also wouldn't say they're 100% telling the truth either. It feels like they're holding something back or just really uneasy, but I can't tell which. Maybe it's a mix of both—like they're being truthful but struggling with how to say it. I'd need more to go on to feel confident.

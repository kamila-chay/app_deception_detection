Looking at this clip, I'm honestly not 100% sure, but I'll try to break down what I'm seeing. The person seems to be making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze toward the interlocutor the whole time—which usually feels like a sign of honesty, not deception. They're also nodding along while speaking, which can feel natural when someone's engaged, but sometimes people do that to seem cooperative when they're lying. Their hands are open with palms up and arms relaxed, which feels like they're trying to look open and approachable—something I'd expect from someone being truthful. But then there's the blinking: they're blinking way more than usual, like almost constantly, and their eyebrows are raised a lot, especially when they're answering. Those two things together make me pause because I've heard that nervous habits like frequent blinking or raised eyebrows can sometimes pop up when people are stressed about lying, even if they're trying to hide it.  

On the flip side, though, I'm not convinced. Maybe they're just genuinely nervous about the topic—not because they're lying, but because it's a sensitive question or they're not used to being on camera. The raised eyebrows could just be them being expressive, like they're processing the question. And that slight smile (lip corners up) feels more like a polite, maybe even a bit strained, attempt to seem friendly rather than a fake smile for deception. I've seen people smile like that when they're trying to be nice, not when they're covering something up. The head shaking too—it looked like a quick "no" to something, but it could just be them disagreeing with a previous point, not necessarily denying something.  

Honestly, the open posture and eye contact are making me lean toward them being truthful, but the blinking and eyebrows are throwing me off. I think I'd need to hear the actual words they're saying or see more context to feel confident. Like, if they were dodging questions or contradicting themselves, that'd be different, but from the body language alone, it's really ambiguous. It feels like maybe they're just a bit anxious, not necessarily lying. But I'm not ruling it out entirely—sometimes people who lie *do* look nervous, even if they're trying to seem calm. I'd say it's a maybe, leaning slightly toward truth, but I'd hate to be wrong.

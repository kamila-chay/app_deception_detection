Hmm, looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is that they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time—like, they're not avoiding eye contact at all. That usually makes me lean toward them being honest because liars often fidget or look away, right? And they have this little smile where their lips are turned up at the corners, which seems pretty relaxed, not like a forced "I'm lying but I'm trying to seem nice" smile. It looks genuine, like they're actually comfortable or happy to be sharing this.

But then there's the blinking. They're blinking way more than usual—like, constantly. I've heard that frequent blinking can sometimes be a sign of stress or nervousness, which people might show when they're lying. So that part makes me pause a little. Maybe they're just naturally a fast-blinker, though? I know some people do that without any reason, especially if they're tired or in a dry room. And the smile seems to match what they're saying, not like it's disconnected from the story. If they were making it up, I'd expect the smile to feel off or not sync with their words, but here it seems to fit.

On the other hand, if they *were* lying, why would they keep making eye contact and smile like that? Some people do overcompensate by being *too* friendly, but this doesn't feel like that. It feels more like they're just... being themselves. The lack of other tells—no frowning, no hands covering their mouth, no awkward pauses—also makes it seem like they're not trying to hide anything. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more of those little nervous gestures, but there's almost nothing. 

Still, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the blinking is just them being extra alert, or maybe they're genuinely stressed about the topic but still telling the truth. It's hard to say for sure without hearing the actual words. But based on what I see—looking at the person, the natural smile, and no other signs of deception—I'd guess they're probably telling the truth. It just feels... consistent. But yeah, it's not a slam dunk, so I'd say it's a maybe, leaning toward truth.

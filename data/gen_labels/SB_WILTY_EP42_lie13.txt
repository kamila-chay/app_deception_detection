Hmm, I'm trying to figure out if this person is lying based on the video, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. I don't see any obvious signs like them smiling nervously or laughing awkwardly, which sometimes happen when people are being deceptive. But there are a few things that stand out to me as I watch them. Their eyebrows are raised quite a bit—like, they're really doing that "wait, what?" thing—and they keep closing their eyes in this exaggerated way, almost like they're squinting hard or trying to shut something out. Their chin is moving up and down too, like they're constantly adjusting it, which feels a bit forced. And their head is tilted sideways a lot while they're talking, and they keep looking up and down, not directly at the person they're speaking to. 

On the surface, that *could* be signs of lying—raised eyebrows might mean they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical, the exaggerated eye closing might be an attempt to avoid eye contact, and the chin movements and head tilt often signal discomfort or trying to control their expression when they're not being truthful. The gaze patterns too, looking up and down instead of steady, sometimes correlates with deception because people might look away when fabricating a story. 

But I'm really not sure. I've seen people who just naturally have expressive faces or fidgety habits like that, even when they're being honest. Maybe they're just really thoughtful or a bit anxious about the situation, not necessarily lying. The fact that they're not smiling or laughing at all might also just mean they're serious or uncomfortable, not deceptive. And some people genuinely look away when they're thinking hard about an answer—like they're trying to recall something, which could be truthful. 

Honestly, I'd lean a little toward them not being truthful just because of the combination of those specific cues—the exaggerated eye closing, the chin movements, and the head tilt together feel a bit too coordinated for someone who's just relaxed. But I wouldn't bet money on it. It's easy to misread someone's behavior, especially in a short clip. If I had more context or saw them in a different situation, I might feel more confident. Right now, it's just a gut feeling based on what I'm seeing, but I'd say it's *possible* they're not being completely honest, just not 100% certain.

Watching the video, I lean toward thinking this person might be lying, though it's not entirely clear-cut. They don’t display the usual nervous smiling or awkward laughter that often accompany deception, but other behaviors catch my attention. Their eyebrows are raised in a way that feels somewhat exaggerated, as if they're trying to convey surprise or disbelief intentionally. The way they repeatedly close their eyes—almost as if shutting something out—is unusually pronounced. Additionally, their chin keeps moving up and down in a manner that seems forced, and the frequent head tilting combined with avoidant eye movements, looking up and down instead of directly at the person they're speaking to, could suggest discomfort or an attempt to control their expressions.

These signs, taken together, suggest they might be putting effort into managing how they come across, which could point to deception. People who lie often exhibit such controlled or exaggerated gestures as they try to maintain their story. That said, it’s possible these behaviors stem from natural expressiveness or anxiety rather than dishonesty. Some individuals do have fidgety habits or look away when thinking—even if they are truthful. Considering all this, my sense is that they are probably not being completely truthful, but I can’t say that with full confidence. It’s a tentative impression based on these subtle cues rather than definitive proof.

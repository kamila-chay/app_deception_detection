Watching the clip now, I'm trying to figure out if this person's being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is that they're looking straight up while they're speaking—like they're staring at the ceiling or just above the camera. I've heard that when people look up while talking, it can sometimes mean they're trying to recall something real, not make it up, so that feels like a sign they might be telling the truth. Plus, they're not doing any of those classic "lying" things—no frowning, no weird blinking, no lip biting or shifting around like they're nervous. They just seem calm and steady, which makes me lean toward "truth" at first glance.  

But then I start second-guessing myself. I know some people who are really good at hiding their lies, so maybe they're just super composed. Like, if someone's practiced lying for years, they might not show any of those little stress cues. And honestly, the "gaze up" thing isn't foolproof—it could also mean they're just thinking hard, whether they're lying or not. Maybe they're trying to remember a detail, or maybe they're just not used to being filmed and it's a natural habit. I've seen people look up like that even when they're being honest, so I can't just take that as proof.  

Another thing: the clip doesn't show any awkward pauses or lip movements that might hint at discomfort, but that doesn't mean much either. Some people just talk like that, especially if they're used to speaking clearly. It could be that they're actually telling the truth and that's just how they communicate, or it could be that they're lying but they're not the type to fidget. I keep going back to the lack of nervous gestures—it feels like a relief, but I don't want to assume that means truth.  

Honestly, I'm not sure. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, it seems like they're probably being truthful because the behavior doesn't scream "deception," but I'd want more context to be confident. Like, what are they even talking about? If it's a simple fact they'd know, it's easier to believe. But if it's something complicated, I'd wonder more. Still, without seeing their full story, I'd say the cues point toward truth, even if it's not 100% certain. It just doesn't feel like the kind of behavior that's trying to hide something. But yeah, I'm not going to claim I know for sure—this is just what I'm picking up from the video.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video, honestly. I watched the clip a couple of times, and the person seems pretty calm overall. They're not smiling or laughing, which is interesting since they're talking to someone, but I guess that's just their usual demeanor. What stood out most was how they kept looking down a bit while still keeping their gaze directed toward the person they're talking to—like, they weren't avoiding eye contact entirely, just glancing down occasionally. And they did raise their eyebrows a couple of times, which made me wonder if they were surprised or maybe trying to seem skeptical. 

On the one hand, the lack of obvious "lie signs" makes me lean toward them being truthful. You know, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed, no trying to cover their mouth or anything. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those nervous tells, especially if they were trying to be convincing. The fact that they're maintaining eye contact (gaze towards interlocutor is true) also feels more like someone being genuine—liars often look away more, but not always. Maybe they're just thoughtful or a bit shy, which could explain the downward gaze. 

But then again, the raised eyebrows and the downward gaze *could* be signs of stress or deception, especially if they're trying to seem calm. Sometimes people do that when they're rehearsing a story or feeling uneasy. I mean, it's not a huge red flag, but it's not *completely* normal either. Like, if they were just answering a simple question, why would they keep looking down? It might just be their habit though—some people look down when they're concentrating, and it's not necessarily a lie. 

I guess the real question is context, which I don't have. If this was a casual conversation about something harmless, the behavior seems pretty neutral. But if it was a high-stakes question, those little cues might mean more. Still, without knowing what they were talking about, it's hard to say. I'm not 100% sure, but I'd probably lean toward them being truthful just because there's nothing *really* off about their body language—no big tells, no overacting. But I wouldn't bet money on it either. It's one of those cases where you'd need more to go on.

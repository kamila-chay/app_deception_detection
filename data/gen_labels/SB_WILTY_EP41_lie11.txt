Honestly, I'm not completely sure, but I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might be lying. The open arms do suggest an attempt to appear approachable or honest, which generally isn't typical of someone being deceptive. However, certain other cues give me pause. The sideways gaze, for example, can often indicate discomfort or avoidance of eye contact, behaviors commonly associated with deception. Similarly, the downward tilt of the chin might hint at nervousness, which could be a sign of dishonesty. While it’s true that people sometimes show these behaviors simply because they're thinking or processing heavy topics, the combination here feels somewhat off. Although they seem calm and don’t fidget or over-explain—which would usually suggest truthfulness—the subtle signs of discomfort make me question their sincerity. Overall, despite some signals of openness, the presence of these mixed cues nudges me toward suspecting that they might not be entirely truthful. It’s not definitive, but I do lean toward the possibility that they’re being deceptive.

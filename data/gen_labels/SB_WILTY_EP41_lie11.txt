Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them not lying based on what I'm seeing. The arms being open feels really strong—like they're trying to seem approachable or honest, which usually doesn't happen when someone's deceptive. And they're nodding along while looking at the person they're talking to, which seems engaged, not evasive. The raised eyebrows stand out a bit, but that could just be surprise or confusion about the question, not necessarily lying. I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're thinking hard, not when they're hiding something.  

That said, the sideways gaze and chin moving down do make me pause. Sideways looks can sometimes signal discomfort or avoiding eye contact, which people do when they're not being truthful. And the chin moving down—like a little downward tilt—sometimes happens when someone's nervous, which might hint at deception. But then again, I've noticed people do that when they're just processing thoughts, especially if the topic is heavy. The lack of fidgeting or awkward pauses is also reassuring; if they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy like fidgeting or over-explaining, but they seem pretty calm otherwise.  

The thing that keeps me leaning toward truth is the arms being open—it's such a clear sign of openness in body language. Deceptive people often cross their arms or make themselves smaller, but here they're the opposite. So yeah, the sideways gaze and chin movement are nagging at me, but the overall vibe feels more like someone who's just a bit tense about the conversation, not actively lying. It's tricky, though—sometimes the little things add up, but I think in this case, the openness of their posture outweighs the other cues. I'd say they're probably being honest, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

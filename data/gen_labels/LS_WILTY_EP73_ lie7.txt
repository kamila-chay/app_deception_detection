Hmm, looking at this clip, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty engaged with whoever they're talking to—they're making consistent eye contact, which usually feels like someone being straightforward. But then there's that head shake at the end, like they're emphatically saying "no" to something, and their eyebrows are raised a bit while they're doing it. That little eyebrow lift can sometimes happen when people are trying to seem sincere or when they're nervous, but it's not a clear "lie" sign on its own. 

I also notice their mouth corners are pulled up slightly, like a soft smile, which might just be them being polite or trying to seem calm, but it's not a full smile. If they were really lying, I'd expect more tension—like lips pressed tight or avoiding eye contact—but here they're holding the gaze. Still, the head shake is nagging at me. People often shake their heads when they're denying something, but that doesn't always mean they're lying. Maybe they're just correcting a misunderstanding, or it's a habit. 

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth, why would they have that slight tension in their face? Sometimes truth-tellers get a bit flustered too, especially if they're being questioned. And the eye contact feels genuine—they're not looking away or shifting, which is a common sign of deception. But I keep thinking: what if they're just really sure about their answer and the head shake is just natural emphasis? Like, "No, I didn't do it" while shaking their head, but actually being honest. 

I'm not entirely sure. It's the head shake that makes me lean toward "maybe lying," but I'm also second-guessing because the rest of the cues don't scream deception. It could easily be a nervous person being truthful. Honestly, without knowing the context of the question they're answering, it's hard to say for sure. My gut says they might be trying to seem convincing, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like a maybe, not a definite.

Looking at this clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. They maintain consistent eye contact, which often suggests honesty, and their mouth corners lift slightly in a polite, calm way, which isn’t typical of someone trying to hide something intensely. However, that head shake they give at the end, coupled with the raised eyebrows, raises some doubts. The combination feels like an emphatic denial that carries a hint of nervousness or an attempt to convince, rather than straightforward truthfulness. While truth-tellers can also show tension or nervousness, this specific mix—the firm "no" with a subtle expression shift—makes me suspect the person could be masking something. It’s not a slam dunk case, and they might simply be emphasizing their point or reacting habitually, but overall, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that they’re not entirely truthful. Without more context, though, it’s hard to be sure, so I wouldn’t rule out honesty either.

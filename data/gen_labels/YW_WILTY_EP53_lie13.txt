Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them not being entirely truthful—though I'm really hesitant to say that outright. The way they're raising their eyebrows a few times feels a bit forced, like they're trying to seem surprised or engaged, but it doesn't quite match the rest of their expression. And that downward gaze while still looking at the person? It's weirdly specific—I mean, they're not avoiding eye contact entirely, but they keep glancing down, which often happens when someone's searching for words or trying to keep their story straight. The chin moving down a little too, like it's a subtle, almost involuntary dip, that also feels off. Nodding along while doing that... it could just be them trying to seem cooperative, but it doesn't feel natural.  

But here's why I'm second-guessing myself: maybe they're just nervous or genuinely trying to think through their answer. I've seen people do the same thing when they're being honest but struggling to recall details—like when you're trying to remember a name and your eyes drift down while you're thinking. The fact that they're not smiling or laughing at all could also just mean they're in a serious mood, not necessarily lying. And the eyebrow raises? Could be genuine surprise about what's being asked, not deception.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The cues point to deception, but they're not the strongest ones—no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no obvious tells like covering the mouth. It feels more like someone who's uncomfortable or stressed, which could go either way. I'd probably need more context to be sure, like if they're contradicting something or if their story changes. But based on just this clip? I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's just... off in a way that makes me wonder.

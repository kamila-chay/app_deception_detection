Looking at the clip, I'm not totally sure, but I'm leaning toward them possibly not being entirely truthful. The thing that sticks out to me is how they're raising their eyebrows and really widening their eyes—like, *way* more than seems natural for just listening or answering a question. It feels kind of forced, like they're trying to seem extra attentive or surprised, but it doesn't quite match what they're saying. And they keep looking down while they talk, which is interesting because they're still making some eye contact with the person they're speaking to, but the downward gaze makes me think they might be avoiding something or just not feeling comfortable.

But here's where I hesitate: some people just naturally have expressive eyebrows and big eyes, right? Maybe they're just really earnest or a bit nervous about the topic, not necessarily lying. The fact that they're not frowning, laughing, or avoiding eye contact entirely (they actually seem to be looking at the other person most of the time) makes me wonder if it's just their normal way of talking. I've known people who do that when they're being really careful with their words, but it's not always deception—it could just be them trying to be polite or thoughtful.

Also, the lack of other classic "lie signs" like fidgeting or awkward pauses is confusing. If they were really lying, I'd expect more of those tells, like touching their face or seeming stiff. But here, they're just... *there*, with those exaggerated eyes and raised brows. It's hard to say for sure though—people are all different, and sometimes the signs are subtle or mixed. I'd say it's a maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it. It feels more like they're trying too hard to seem sincere than they're actually hiding something, but I could be wrong. Honestly, without more context, it's tough to pin down.

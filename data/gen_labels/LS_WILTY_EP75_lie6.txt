Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip now, and the person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. They're actually looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which I'd usually associate more with honesty than lying, though I know that's not a hard rule. The thing that stands out most is that moment where they raise their eyebrows really quickly, and then they tilt their head slightly to the side. At first glance, I thought maybe that's a classic "lie sign," like when people get nervous and do those little micro-expressions. But honestly, I've seen people do that when they're genuinely surprised by a question or just trying to process something, not necessarily when they're being deceptive. Like, if someone asks you an unexpected question, you might instinctively raise your eyebrows and turn your head a bit to listen closer. 

On the other hand, the head tilting... I've heard some people say that's a sign of deception, like when someone's "thinking up" a story. But I'm not sure how reliable that is—sometimes people just naturally tilt their heads when they're engaged in a conversation. And they're not doing anything else that screams "liar," like covering their mouth, avoiding eye contact, or looking away a lot. In fact, they seem pretty steady, with no awkward pauses or forced smiles. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more signs of stress, like fidgeting or a tense jaw, but that's not here. 

Still, I'm not totally convinced it's truth-telling either. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe the context of the conversation matters—like if they were being asked something super sensitive, even a calm person might get those little reactions. I mean, I've definitely raised my eyebrows when I was trying to remember something without lying, so it's hard to pin it down. Honestly, I'd lean toward them not lying based on what I'm seeing—no red flags jumping out at me—but I wouldn't bet money on it. It feels more like they're just being thoughtful or a bit taken aback by the question, not actively trying to deceive. But yeah, I'd need to hear the actual question and context to feel more sure.

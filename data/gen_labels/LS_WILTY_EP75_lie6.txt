This is a bit complicated. Watching the clip, the person appears fairly calm, with no obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. They maintain direct eye contact, which is often seen as a sign of honesty, although that’s not always definitive. However, the quick eyebrow raise followed by a slight head tilt catches my attention. While these could be interpreted as micro-expressions linked to nervousness or deception, they might also simply indicate surprise or a moment of processing the question. 

That said, the head tilt is sometimes noted as a potential cue for someone “thinking up” a story, which makes me wonder if it could be a subtle hint toward deception here. There are no other classic signs such as covering the mouth, avoiding gaze, or showing signs of stress, so it isn’t obvious lying. The person seems steady and composed without forced smiles or awkward pauses, which complicates the assessment.

Still, I find myself leaning slightly toward the possibility that there might be some deception involved. It could be that they’re skilled at masking more conspicuous signs or perhaps the subtle expressions are indicative of something less straightforward. Without more context or hearing the specific question, it’s hard to be certain, but my impression is that while it’s not blatantly obvious, there’s a reasonable chance they could be hiding something.

I'm watching this clip, and honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up for me. The person seems to be looking directly at the other person most of the time—like they're trying to maintain eye contact—but then they keep glancing down, almost like they're avoiding it for a second before snapping back up. And they're tilting their head a little, which I've noticed people do when they're listening carefully or even when they're trying to seem sincere. It's not the dramatic head-shaking or fidgeting I'd expect if someone was lying, though. They're just... calm. No weird smiles, no lip-biting, no over-the-top gestures. If anything, the lack of nervous tells makes me lean toward them being truthful—like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to be more visibly stressed, right? But then again, I've heard that some people who lie are really good at controlling their body language, so maybe they're just a practiced liar. The head tilting could also just be a habit, like how some people tilt their heads when they're thinking about what to say, not necessarily hiding something. And the fact that they're looking at the person while glancing down might just mean they're shy or thoughtful, not deceptive. I mean, I've seen people do that when they're being honest but just a bit uncomfortable with the topic. But... it's hard to say. The video doesn't give me strong clues either way, and I don't know the context of what they're talking about. If it's something really sensitive, the calmness might actually be a red flag, but if it's a casual conversation, it feels natural. Honestly, I'd probably need more to go on—like their tone of voice or the actual content of what they're saying—to feel confident. Right now, I'm just not sure. It could go either way.

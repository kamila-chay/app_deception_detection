Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person is nodding while they're speaking, which is the only clear physical behavior I notice. They're not fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or showing any obvious signs of discomfort like frowning or excessive blinking. To me, that nod feels like a natural part of them confirming or emphasizing what they're saying—like when someone is being straightforward and wants to make sure they're being clear. It’s the kind of thing I’d do when I’m telling the truth about something simple, just to reinforce my point.  

But honestly, I’m not totally sure. Nodding can sometimes be a nervous habit, especially if someone’s trying to seem more convincing, even if they’re not being truthful. I’ve seen people do that in interviews or when they’re rehearsed—like they’ve been told to "look confident" and nod to fake agreement. And the fact that they’re not making eye contact (since "gaze towards interlocutor" is false in the data) could go either way: maybe they’re just shy, or maybe they’re avoiding it because they’re uncomfortable.  

What makes me lean toward truth is that there’s almost nothing else going on. No lip-biting, no hand-rubbing, no sudden shifts in posture—that usually feels more like someone who’s relaxed and not trying to hide anything. But I know people can fake calmness too, so I shouldn’t overthink it. Honestly, it’s hard to tell from just one clip. If this was a conversation about something small, like confirming a time they were at work, the nod and lack of tells would probably make me trust them. But if it’s a high-stakes question, I’d want more context.  

All in all, I’d guess they’re probably telling the truth, but I’d still want to hear the full conversation to be sure. Body language alone isn’t foolproof—it’s just one piece of the puzzle.

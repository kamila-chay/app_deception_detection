When I watched the clip, the person was speaking directly to the camera with steady eye contact—no looking away or avoiding gaze, which usually makes me think they're being straightforward. Their hands were open, palms up, and they didn't fidget or touch their face, which feels like an open, relaxed posture. I didn't see any nervous ticks like rapid blinking, frowning, or shifting around, which often show up when someone's uncomfortable. That makes me lean toward them telling the truth because it seems like they're not hiding anything.  

But honestly, it's not 100% clear-cut. I've seen people who lie really well—like actors or people who've practiced being calm—so they might just be good at faking that relaxed vibe. Maybe they're used to being on camera, or they're just naturally expressive without any anxiety. And while palms up is often seen as honest, it could also be a cultural thing or just how they gesture naturally. Like, maybe they're just gesturing like they always do, not trying to seem truthful.  

I also wonder if the context matters—like, if they're answering something super simple or rehearsed, they might look calm even if they're not. But since the clip didn't have any obvious signs of stress or evasion, I'm more inclined to believe them. Still, I wouldn't bet money on it. I'd say it's probably truth, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at hiding it. It feels like the safer call, but I'd want to see more of the conversation before being sure.

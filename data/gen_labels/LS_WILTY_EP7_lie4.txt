Looking at this clip, I'm honestly a bit torn about whether they're lying or not. On one hand, I notice they're raising their eyebrows quite a bit and blinking a lot—those are things I've heard can sometimes signal stress or discomfort, which people might show when they're not being truthful. The way their lip corners are pulled up almost like a tight smile feels a little off too, like it's not quite reaching their eyes, and their chin is lifting up a tiny bit, almost like they're trying to appear confident. Plus, they keep looking down while talking instead of meeting the other person's eyes directly, which I've seen in other videos where people seem evasive. The head moving backward a little when they're speaking also gives me a slight "defensive" vibe, like they're mentally stepping away from what they're saying.

But then, there are things that make me second-guess. Their arms are wide open the whole time, which usually feels like an open, honest posture to me—not something I'd expect from someone trying to hide something. And they're actually looking at the other person most of the time, not avoiding them, which is the opposite of what I'd expect if they were lying. The frequent blinking could just be from dry eyes or the lighting in the room, and that slight smile might just be their natural way of smiling when they're talking—like they're trying to be friendly. I've known people who get super nervous and do all those little nervous tics, but they're totally telling the truth about whatever they're discussing. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure. The signs lean a bit toward deception, but they're so mixed with behaviors that feel genuine that I can't rule out the possibility they're just really stressed about the topic or have a habit of doing those things when they're thinking hard. I wouldn't bet money on it either way—I'd say it's more likely they're not lying, but I'm not 100% certain. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to see more context before I felt confident. It's one of those cases where the video doesn't give me a clear answer, just a bunch of little hints that could go either way.

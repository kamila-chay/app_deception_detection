Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while speaking. They're holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really engaged in the conversation—and their head is leaning forward slightly, which feels like they're actively listening or trying to connect. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" signs either: no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck, no avoiding eye contact by looking away, and nothing like scratching or covering their mouth. Honestly, that calmness and direct engagement kind of makes me lean toward thinking they're being truthful. When people are lying, especially under pressure, they often fidget or seem distracted, but this person just seems... present.

But I can't say for sure, you know? Like, I've heard that some people are just naturally good at keeping their cool when they're lying—they might practice not blinking or avoiding eye contact, so the *absence* of those tells doesn't automatically mean truth. And it's possible they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not even stressed about what they're saying. Also, eye contact itself can be tricky—some cultures or personalities just make more eye contact naturally, even when they're being honest, so it might not be a perfect clue. I mean, if they were lying about something super mundane, like "I ate cereal for breakfast," they'd probably seem relaxed no matter what. But if it's something heavy, like a personal accusation, that calmness might be more suspicious. Still, in this clip, everything just feels... straightforward. No red flags jumping out at me, so I'd guess they're telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just hard to say for certain without knowing the context.

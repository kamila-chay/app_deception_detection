Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that "gaze towards interlocutor" is pretty clear, and they're not avoiding the camera or looking away a lot. That usually feels like a sign of someone being engaged and, honestly, more likely to be truthful. I've noticed in real life that people who are lying often fidget or look down, but here they're not doing any of that—no frowning, no awkward pauses, no lip biting or hand movements. The fact that they're not showing any of those classic "lie tells" makes me lean toward them being honest.

But then there's that sideways glance they keep making—like, every now and then they'll shift their gaze just slightly to the side. I wonder if that's because they're thinking about what to say next, or if it's a nervous habit. Sometimes people do that when they're recalling something, not necessarily when they're lying. Like, if you're trying to remember a detail, you might glance away for a second. So maybe it's just them processing, not deception. And that chin moving upward—like, a tiny lift when they're speaking—doesn't seem forced or fake. It almost looks like they're leaning in with confidence, which feels more like someone who's telling the truth than someone trying to hide something.

On the flip side, I could see someone arguing that the sideways glance *is* a red flag. If they're avoiding direct eye contact even a little, maybe it's a sign they're not fully comfortable with what they're saying. But the thing is, they're *not* avoiding it entirely—they're still looking at the person most of the time. And the video doesn't show any other signs of stress, like blinking a lot or fidgeting, which usually go hand-in-hand with lying. So if they were lying, I'd expect more of those physical cues. Without them, it feels like the sideways glance might just be... natural. Like, people don't stare straight ahead without ever moving their eyes.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, the absence of the usual "lie" behaviors seems to outweigh that one sideways glance. It’s not like they’re acting suspiciously—they seem calm, steady, and focused on the conversation. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth, but I’d still be a little cautious because you never know what’s going on behind the scenes. Maybe they’re just a little distracted, or maybe they’ve rehearsed what they’re saying and that’s why they’re not looking away much. Either way, it doesn’t scream "lying" to me.

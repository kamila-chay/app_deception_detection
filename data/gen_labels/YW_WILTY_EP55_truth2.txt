Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, and honestly? It's a bit tricky because nonverbal cues can be so ambiguous. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no looking away or down, which usually feels like someone trying to seem honest, though I know some liars practice that too. Their hands are open, palms up, which often reads as genuine or open in my experience, not like they're hiding something. And they're raising their eyebrows a few times—like when they're processing something or maybe genuinely surprised by what they're saying? But I've also seen that happen when people are trying to seem sincere while lying.

On the other hand, I keep wondering if they're just really good at controlling themselves. Like, maybe they're used to being questioned or have practiced staying calm under pressure. The fact that they don't seem nervous—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles—could mean they're telling the truth, but it could also mean they're just really practiced at hiding it. I've heard that some skilled liars don't show stress cues at all, so the lack of those might not mean much. And that eyebrow-raising... it's not a clear sign either. It could be natural curiosity or just a habit, not necessarily a "truth" signal.

Honestly, the more I watch, the more I lean toward them being truthful. The open palms and steady eye contact feel like they're not trying to shut things down or deflect, and the absence of other "tells" (like lip biting or looking away) makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying. But I'm not 100% sure—people can fake calmness, and I'm not a behavior expert. It's easy to second-guess. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'd also be ready to be wrong. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of nervous energy you'd expect if they were lying, but I know that's subjective. Maybe it's just me projecting my own bias toward calm people being honest. Either way, I don't see anything that screams "lying" to me, so I'd go with truth, but cautiously.

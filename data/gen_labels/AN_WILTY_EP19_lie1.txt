Hmm, I'm watching this clip and honestly, it's a bit hard to tell. The person seems pretty still overall—no smiling, no laughing, no obvious fidgeting like scratching or rubbing hands. But there are a couple of things that stand out. They keep raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're surprised or maybe trying to seem innocent? And their eyes are really wide open sometimes—almost like they're exaggerating how wide they're looking, which feels a little off. Also, they're not really making eye contact with whoever they're talking to; their gaze is mostly down or flicking sideways, like they're avoiding the person's face.

On one hand, that combination—raised eyebrows, exaggerated eye openness, and avoiding direct gaze—does make me lean toward "maybe lying." Those can be classic signs people use when they're not being truthful, especially if they're trying to seem calm or engaged. The lack of other tells like fidgeting or a forced smile makes it feel more deliberate, like they're suppressing nervous habits. It’s the kind of behavior where someone might be overcompensating to seem honest.

But then I keep thinking, maybe it’s not about lying at all. Maybe they’re just really shy or uncomfortable in the situation, not necessarily hiding something. Raised eyebrows could just be surprise at what they’re saying, and the wide eyes might be genuine—like they’re trying to listen carefully or process something. Gazing down or sideways isn’t always deceptive; it could just be how they think when they’re speaking, or they might be naturally averse to direct eye contact. I’ve seen people do that without any deception involved. 

Honestly, I’m not sure. It’s a tough one. The cues point in a direction that suggests deception, but they’re not super clear-cut. If I had to guess based on what I’m seeing, I’d say it’s *possible* they’re not being fully truthful, but it’s also very plausible they’re just nervous or awkward. I wouldn’t bet on it one way or the other—I’d need more context to be confident. It’s the kind of thing where your gut might lean one way, but you’d second-guess yourself.

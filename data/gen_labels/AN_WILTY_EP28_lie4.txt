Hmm, this one's a bit tricky to call just from the video. At first glance, they seem pretty engaged—looking right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels more like someone being honest, not hiding something. The smile is there too, and it looks pretty natural, not like a forced grin. And palms up? That’s usually a sign people use when they’re trying to seem open or truthful, so that leans toward "telling the truth" for me.  

But then there’s the head shaking—like, they’re nodding "no" while still smiling, which feels a little off. I’ve seen people do that when they’re nervous or trying to soften a denial, but it’s not super clear. And the raised eyebrows? That’s the part that sticks out. Sometimes people raise them when they’re genuinely surprised or confused, but it can also be a subtle sign of stress when someone’s trying to hold it together. The upward gaze while talking is another weird one—truthful people often look up to recall details, but so do liars when they’re fabricating things. Honestly, it’s hard to tell if that’s just them thinking or if they’re making something up.  

I keep circling back to the smile and palms up though. If they were lying, I’d expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they’re holding steady and even using that open-hand gesture. Maybe the head shake is just a habit, or they’re politely disagreeing without meaning to deceive. But then again, maybe the smile is a cover for the discomfort they’re feeling. I’m not 100% sure—I’d need more context, like what they’re actually saying. It feels like they might be hiding something small, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. Honestly, I’m leaning a little toward truth, but I’d want to hear the full conversation to be sure. What do you think?

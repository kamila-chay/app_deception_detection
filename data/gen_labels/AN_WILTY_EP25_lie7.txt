Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people act differently under pressure. What stands out to me is that they're giving this kind of tight, almost forced smile the whole time—like they're trying *too* hard to seem relaxed. And their eyebrows are constantly raised, which usually happens when someone's surprised or stressed, not when they're just being casual. Plus, they keep looking down at their lap instead of meeting the other person's eyes. I've heard that avoiding eye contact is a common sign of deception, so that’s making me lean toward them not being fully honest.

But I'm not totally sure. Maybe they're just really shy or uncomfortable with the situation—not necessarily lying. The smile could be a nervous habit, like when you try to cover up awkwardness. And raised eyebrows? That could just mean they're genuinely taken aback by the question, not that they're hiding something. I've seen people do that when they're being asked something unexpected, even if they're telling the truth. Also, they don't seem to be fidgeting or doing other nervous things like touching their face or crossing their arms, which sometimes happens when people are lying. So maybe it's just a case of them being really tense about the topic, not deception.

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without more context. The combination of the stiff smile, the raised brows, and the gaze down *does* feel off, but it could easily be something else. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it. People get awkward for all sorts of reasons, and this might just be one of them. I'd need to see more of the conversation or hear their answers to feel more confident. For now, I'm leaning toward "maybe" but not "definitely."

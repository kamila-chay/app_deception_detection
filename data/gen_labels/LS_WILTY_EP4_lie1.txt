Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them being truthful—though I can see why someone might think otherwise. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor is true), and they're nodding along while speaking, which usually feels like genuine engagement. Head tilting and keeping their head up also seem like they're actively listening or trying to connect, not hiding something. Those are pretty strong signs of openness, not deception.  

But here's where I'm confused: they keep looking down a lot (gaze down is true), which sometimes happens when people are lying or feeling uncomfortable. And their chin is moving up and down—like they're subtly adjusting their jaw or chin, which can be a nervous habit. I've heard that when people lie, they might do little physical things like that to mask tension. The raised eyebrows too—maybe they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical to cover up a story? But honestly, raised eyebrows can also just mean they're processing what they're saying, not necessarily lying.  

The thing that throws me off is the lack of other "lie signs" we often hear about—no frowning, no fake smiles, no avoiding eye contact entirely. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs like fidgeting or stiff expressions, but they seem pretty relaxed in their posture. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their chin or they're genuinely thoughtful while answering.  

I guess I'm split. The down gaze and chin movements make me wonder, but the eye contact and nodding feel too consistent for deception. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. Like, maybe they're just being humble or careful with their words, not lying. It's really hard to say without more context—people act differently when they're nervous versus when they're lying.

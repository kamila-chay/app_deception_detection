Hmm, looking at this video clip... it's a bit tricky to say for sure, but I'm leaning toward them being truthful based on what I'm seeing. The person is smiling naturally and keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that feels genuine to me. When people are lying, they often avoid eye contact or seem tense, but here they're relaxed and engaged, like they're actually listening or sharing something they're comfortable with. The smile isn't forced either; it's just a normal, warm expression, and they don't have any of those nervous little tells like fidgeting, lip biting, or excessive blinking. 

That said, I can't rule out lying completely. Some people are really good at faking calmness—they might practice keeping eye contact or smiling to seem honest, especially if they're used to lying. And honestly, smiling alone isn't foolproof; people smile when they're nervous too, or just because they're polite. I've seen so many examples where someone seems perfectly chill but is actually hiding something. Plus, cultural differences matter—some people maintain eye contact as a sign of respect, not truthfulness, so it might not mean what I'm assuming. 

But overall, the absence of those classic "liar signs" (no awkward pauses, no crossed arms, no avoiding gaze) makes me think it's more likely they're being honest. It's not a slam dunk, though—lying can look super normal if the person's confident. I'd say it's probably truthful, but I'd want to see more context before I'd bet on it. Like, what's the situation? If they're just chatting about their weekend, this behavior fits. If it's a high-stakes question, maybe not. But based purely on the video... yeah, I'd guess truth. Still, I'd hesitate to call it 100%—it's just what feels most plausible here.

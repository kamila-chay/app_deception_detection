Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching the video, but here's how I'm leaning after thinking it through. What stood out to me was how steady they were—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no avoiding eye contact at all. They were actually looking right at whoever they were talking to the whole time, and they kept nodding like they were genuinely engaged in the conversation. When people lie, especially if they're nervous, they often look away, scratch their face, or seem tense, but this person didn't do any of that. The nodding especially felt natural, like they were agreeing or processing what they were saying, not trying to stall or buy time. 

But then I kept wondering—maybe they're just really good at lying? I've heard some people can stay calm and even make eye contact while lying, especially if they've practiced it or are used to being under pressure. And honestly, the video doesn't show the *context*—like, were they being asked about something they clearly know the answer to? If they were denying something they did, the lack of nervousness might actually be suspicious, right? Like, if they were lying about breaking a vase, I'd expect some hesitation or discomfort, but maybe they're just very composed. 

Also, the way they spoke—well, the video doesn't have audio, so I can't tell if their tone was off, but the body language alone feels more like someone being honest than deceptive. No crossed arms, no lip-biting, no awkward pauses where their mouth was shut. It all just looked... smooth. Like they weren't trying to hide anything. 

Still, I can't be 100% sure. Deception is weird like that—sometimes the most convincing liars look the most relaxed. But based *only* on what I saw, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It just didn't have that "telling" vibe I'd expect. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably being honest, but I'd want to see more of the situation before I'd feel completely confident. Like, if they'd been asked something they clearly didn't know, that'd change things—but as it is, the calmness feels more like truth than deception to me.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I know it's super hard to tell just from video. The main thing that stands out is they're actually making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is interesting because I always hear people say liars look away, but here they're not doing that at all. They're also tilting their head a bit, which usually seems like a sign of being engaged or listening carefully, not like someone trying to hide something. And there's no nervous stuff—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no weird smiles or blinking. They seem pretty calm and composed, which honestly feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying.

But I can see why someone might think they're lying, too. Like, maybe the head tilt is a little forced? Or maybe they're just really good at faking calmness. I've heard that some people who lie can actually look you straight in the eye to seem convincing, so that eye contact might not mean anything for sure. And without knowing what the actual question or topic is, it's hard to tell if they're avoiding details or something. Like, if they're answering something tricky, even a calm person might seem suspicious. I guess the biggest thing is, most of the classic "tells" people look for—like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting—just aren't there. So in that way, it feels more like truth than deception, but I'm definitely not ruling out the other possibility. It's just... hard to say for sure without more context. I'd probably go with truth based on this clip, but I'd want to hear the whole conversation to be safer.

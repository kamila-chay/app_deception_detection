Honestly, I'm not going to claim I'm 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it seems like they're probably telling the truth. The way they're holding their gaze stands out most—direct eye contact with the person they're talking to, plus those subtle sideways glances that feel natural, like they're processing what they're saying or just thinking. There's not a single nervous tic I'd usually associate with lying: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed, no raised eyebrows or shifting eyes away. If they were making it up, I'd expect at least some of those little tells—like avoiding eye contact or touching their face—but here, they're just... calm. It feels like they're focused on answering honestly, not rehearsing or hiding something.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes really practiced liars don't show any of those signs—they might even seem *too* composed, like they're deliberately staying still. And the sideways glances could accidentally look evasive to someone watching quickly, especially if they're not used to seeing people glance sideways while speaking normally. But the fact that they're *also* maintaining that direct gaze with the other person makes it feel less like deception and more like just how they naturally talk—maybe they're thinking through their words, not lying.  

I guess the thing that tips it for me is how *absent* the nervous behaviors are. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of stress—like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat—but there's nothing. It's almost like the lack of those tells is the tell itself. But yeah, I'm not saying it's impossible they're lying; it's just that what I'm seeing aligns more with someone being truthful than not. Honestly, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd still want to hear the full context before being completely sure.

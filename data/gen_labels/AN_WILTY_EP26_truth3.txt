Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it seems like they're probably telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how steady they are—no fidgeting, no weird facial expressions, and they're actually looking at the camera most of the time (gaze towards interlocutor is true). When they do glance down occasionally, it feels natural, like they're just thinking or gathering their words, not avoiding eye contact. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous tells—like blinking a lot, shifting their gaze away, or fiddling with their hands—but there's nothing like that here. The lack of those classic "lying signs" makes it feel genuine, especially since they're not even smiling or scowling, which sometimes happens when people are trying to seem sincere or defensive.

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it? Some people don't show obvious signs when they lie, especially if they're practiced or calm under pressure. And that occasional gaze down could *theoretically* mean they're fabricating something—like when people look away to "think" up a story. But the fact that they're mostly holding eye contact while doing it makes that less likely. It feels more like a normal pause than a deception tactic. Also, the head side-turn is subtle and happens while they're speaking, which is just how people move when they're talking, not something I'd flag as suspicious.

Honestly, though, it's hard to be certain without more context. If I had to guess based on the behavior alone, it leans toward truth because the absence of nervousness is pretty strong evidence for me. But I wouldn't bet money on it—sometimes the quietest people are the most deceptive. Still, what I'm seeing here just doesn't scream "lying" to me. It feels... calm, like they're just answering honestly.

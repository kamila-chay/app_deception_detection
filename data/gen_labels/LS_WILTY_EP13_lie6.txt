Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I keep coming back to the way they're blinking—like, really frequently, almost like they're trying not to look at the camera. That stood out to me right away. And their mouth... it was kind of pulled down at the corners, and they kept sticking their lips out a little, which felt off for someone who's just being casual. Like, if they were relaxed or telling the truth, their face would probably look more neutral or even friendly, but it just seemed tense. They were also glancing down a lot while still trying to look at the person they're talking to, and their head kept tilting like they were processing something, but it felt a bit forced, not like natural curiosity.

But I can see why someone might think it's not deception. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation—like, maybe they're in a stressful interview or talking about something heavy, and that's why they're blinking so much. The lip thing could just be a habit, or maybe they're tired. And the head tilting? I've seen people do that when they're listening carefully, not necessarily hiding something. Sometimes people look down when they're thinking hard, not lying. I mean, I've definitely done that myself when I'm trying to remember something.

Still, putting it all together... the combination of the constant blinking, the negative facial expressions (not smiling, lips down), and that awkward mix of trying to make eye contact while avoiding it by looking down—it just feels like the signs line up more with someone who's not being straightforward. But I'm not saying for sure. It's easy to misread body language, especially if you're not used to it. Maybe they're just a very expressive person, or maybe they're genuinely upset about whatever they're discussing. I'd lean toward deception based on what I saw, but I'd want to see more context before I'd be confident about it. It's hard to say for certain without knowing the full situation.

Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the person doesn't seem to be doing any of the obvious "tells" people usually associate with lying—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no fake smiles or awkward pauses. The one thing that stands out is they keep raising their eyebrows a few times, especially when answering a question. At first, I thought maybe that's a sign of deception, like they're trying to seem innocent or surprised. But then I started wondering—maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they genuinely didn't expect that question and it caught them off guard. I also noticed they weren't looking directly at the person they were talking to, which sometimes happens when people are lying, but it could just mean they're shy or distracted. I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're genuinely confused or processing something, not necessarily when they're hiding something. On the flip side, if they *were* lying, it's odd they're not showing more classic signs—like sweating or shifting around. Maybe they're good at hiding it, or maybe they're just nervous in general. Honestly, I'm not sure. It feels like it *could* be deception because of the eyebrow thing, but it could just be their normal reaction. I'd need to hear the actual conversation to be more certain, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them not lying... but I'm really not 100% sure. It's one of those moments where the behavior is so subtle, it's hard to tell if it's a cue or just them being human.

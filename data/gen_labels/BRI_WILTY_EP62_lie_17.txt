From what I'm seeing in the clip, the person seems a bit fidgety—like they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying not to make eye contact or just really stressed. And they keep crossing their fingers, which feels a bit odd, especially since it's not something I'd usually see in a normal conversation. Those two things together make me lean toward thinking they might be hiding something, but honestly, I'm not totally sure. Frequent blinking can happen for a lot of reasons—maybe their eyes are dry, or the lighting is bothering them, or they're just naturally a nervous person even when telling the truth. And crossing fingers? I've seen people do that all the time without lying, like when they're hoping for a good outcome or just fiddling out of habit. It’s not like they’re avoiding eye contact or looking super uncomfortable in other ways, which usually makes me more suspicious.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the crossing fingers might be a subconscious way of trying to "cross their fingers" for the lie to stick, or maybe they’re trying to calm themselves down. But then again, the lack of other classic signs—no fidgeting with hands, no shifting in their seat, no weird pauses—makes me wonder if it’s just a weird habit. Like, maybe they have a tic or something. I’d probably ask myself, "Is this the kind of nervousness that usually comes with lying, or is it just them being them?" And honestly, I’m not 100% convinced either way. It feels a little suspicious, but it’s not the kind of clear-cut case where I’d say, "Yep, they’re definitely lying." More like, "Hmm, this is a bit off, but I can’t rule out it’s just them being anxious for another reason." So yeah, I’d lean toward deception, but I’d definitely want to see more context before I’d bet on it.

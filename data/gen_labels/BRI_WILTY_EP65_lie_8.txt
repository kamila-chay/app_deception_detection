Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn on whether this person is being truthful or not. They're definitely smiling, which is interesting because that's not always a clear sign—it can happen when people are nervous or trying to seem friendly, but it also happens when they're genuinely happy or relaxed. The way they're raising their eyebrows a couple of times feels a bit exaggerated, like they're trying to look surprised or innocent, which sometimes happens when someone's covering up something. And they keep touching their head or face—like they're adjusting something or just fidgeting—and that kind of self-touching can be a sign of discomfort or stress, which people might do when they're not being fully honest.  

But here's where it gets tricky: I've seen a lot of people smile and raise their eyebrows without lying at all. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're actually responding to something the other person said in a genuine way. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact (they're looking at the person they're talking to, right? Wait, no—the description says "gaze towards interlocutor" is false, so they're actually avoiding eye contact, which *is* a common deception cue). But I've also known people who just don't make eye contact because they're shy or distracted, not because they're lying. And that head-touching—could be a habit, like they have a loose hair or just a nervous tic, not necessarily deception.  

Honestly, the cues here feel mixed. The smile and eyebrow raises might be attempts to seem relaxed, but they're not strong enough on their own. The avoidance of eye contact and the self-touching lean toward deception, but they're not definitive. I wouldn't bet money on it either way. If I had to guess based on this clip alone, I'd say it's *possible* they're not being truthful—especially with the avoidance and the fidgeting—but it's also totally plausible they're just being themselves, and the behaviors are coincidental. Deception is usually a mix of multiple signs, not just one or two, and this feels like it could go either way. I'd want to see more context or hear what they're saying to feel more certain.

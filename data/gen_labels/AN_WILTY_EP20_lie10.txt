Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky to tell just from body language alone. They're definitely making eye contact with the person they're talking to, which is interesting because sometimes people who are deceptive look away a lot, but here they're actually holding that gaze most of the time. Still, there's this constant sideways glance—like they're shifting their eyes to the side while still facing the other person—and that feels a bit off. It's not a full head turn, just a slight side-to-side thing, and I wonder if that's them trying to avoid direct eye contact but not quite managing it.  

Then there's the lip thing—lips pulled back, like they're sort of grimacing or holding their mouth tight. That's one of those subtle signs people sometimes do when they're nervous or trying to suppress an expression, which could happen if they're stressed about lying. And they keep raising their eyebrows, which usually means surprise or skepticism, but here it feels... forced? Like they're trying to seem engaged or neutral, but it's not matching the rest of their expression.  

But honestly, I'm second-guessing myself. Maybe they're just naturally expressive—some people raise their eyebrows a lot even when they're telling the truth. The sideways gaze could just be a habit, or maybe they're thinking hard about what to say. I've seen people who are super anxious during interviews or conversations do similar things without lying. And the lip retraction might not even be about deception—it could be from cold air, or just how they talk.  

I guess the thing that sticks with me is the combination: the eyebrows up, the lips pulled back, and that sideways glance all happening together while they're still trying to look at the other person. It feels like they're straining to seem calm, which *could* point to deception, but I'm really not 100% sure. It's not like they're fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely—those are stronger red flags. So yeah, it's leaning a bit toward "maybe lying," but I'd need way more context to feel confident. Like, what's the conversation about? Are they in a high-stakes situation? Without that, I'd say it's ambiguous—could be nervousness, could be something else. I'd hesitate to call it deception outright.

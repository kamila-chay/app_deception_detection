Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because the person in the video seems so... calm. Like, really calm. They're just sitting there answering whatever question was asked, no obvious signs of stress—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird facial expressions or sudden movements. Most people I know would expect a liar to look away, blink a lot, or maybe shift in their seat, but this person? Zero. Just steady eye contact (well, gaze toward interlocutor is listed as false, but they seem to be looking at the camera directly), no smile, no frown, nothing. It's almost like they're trying *too* hard to be neutral, which makes me wonder if that's the deception itself—like they're so practiced at hiding tells that their calmness is the giveaway.  

But then I keep thinking: maybe they're just telling the truth and they're naturally this composed. Some people are just very relaxed under pressure, right? Like, if they knew the answer to the question or weren't stressed about it, they wouldn't have any reason to fidget or look away. The fact that they're not doing *anything* could just mean they're not lying—they're just not nervous. And honestly, if I saw this in real life, I'd probably assume truthfulness at first glance because it's so... boring. No red flags.  

But here's where it gets tricky: deception experts often say that *overly* calm behavior can be a sign of deception, especially if the person is rehearsed. Like, they've prepared so much that they've suppressed all natural reactions. If this is a high-stakes lie (like denying something they did), they might be forcing themselves to stay still and blank-faced. The lack of *any* micro-expression—no slight lip tugs, no eyebrow lifts—feels a bit unnatural. It’s not that they’re lying *because* they’re calm; it’s that the calmness feels *too* deliberate for someone who’s honest.  

Still, I can’t be sure. Maybe the question was super simple ("What’s your name?"), so there was zero reason to be nervous. Or maybe they’re just not the type to show stress—some people stay cool-headed even when lying. Without knowing the context, it’s really hard. I’d probably ask follow-up questions to see if their story holds up, but based *only* on this clip? I’d lean toward deception because the absence of stress cues *is* the odd thing here. But I’d definitely be second-guessing it. Like, if I had to bet, I’d say "lying," but I’d also be ready to be wrong because it’s so quiet. It’s not like they’re sweating or avoiding eyes—so it’s the opposite of what I’d expect for a liar, which is weird. Maybe that’s the point.  

Honestly, I’d say it’s a toss-up, but if I had to guess, I’d say they’re lying. Not because they’re doing something obvious, but because they’re doing *nothing*—and that’s the thing that makes me pause. Like, why would someone be this perfectly still if they’re telling the truth? But I’m not 100% sure. It’s really hard to tell without more to go on.

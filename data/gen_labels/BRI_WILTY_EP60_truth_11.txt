Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm while speaking—they're not smiling, frowning, or doing any of those nervous little tells like fiddling with their hands or blinking a lot. What stands out is that they're consistently looking right at the camera (or whoever they're talking to), and their eyes are actually looking upward a bit, not down or away. I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I've also read that truth-tellers sometimes look up when they're trying to recall something, like they're mentally pulling details from memory. That could fit here—maybe they're just calmly explaining something they actually remember.  

But honestly, it's not totally clear-cut. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact *could* be a sign they're being honest, but I've also seen people who lie really well just stare you down to seem confident. And the upward gaze—while it *might* indicate they're thinking truthfully—could just be how they naturally talk, like they're gesturing with their eyes or something. There's no other nervous behavior at all: no awkward pauses, no lip biting, nothing. That makes me lean toward "truth" because liars often fidget more, but I know that's not always true. Some people are just really good at staying still when they're lying.  

Honestly, though, without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to be sure. If they were describing a specific event and looked up like that, it might feel more genuine, but if it's just a generic statement, it could be anything. I'd say it's *probably* truth based on the calmness and steady eye contact, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of behavior that screams "lying" to me, but I can't rule out that they're just really composed. Maybe they're just a naturally calm person. Yeah, I'd go with truth, but I'm not 100%—it's one of those cases where the video doesn't give me a smoking gun.

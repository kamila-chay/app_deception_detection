Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone, since I can't hear what they're saying. But looking at their body language... they're not smiling, not laughing, not frowning or scowling—so it's not like they're trying to hide something with fake positivity or anger. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which often happens when someone's genuinely processing something or maybe a little surprised, but I've seen people do that when they're being honest too, not just when lying. And they're looking down a lot instead of at the camera or the person they're talking to—some people do that when they're thinking carefully, especially if they're not used to being on camera, but others might look down to avoid eye contact if they're uncomfortable.  

The thing that makes me lean toward truth is that they're not doing any of the classic "nervous tells" like fidgeting, touching their face, or blinking a ton. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those signs, especially in a situation where they're trying to be convincing. But... I know that's not always reliable. Some people are really good at controlling their body language, or they might just be naturally calm under pressure. Maybe the raised eyebrows are actually a sign of skepticism *about the question*, not the answer—they might be thinking, "Wait, why are they asking that?" which could be totally honest.  

On the flip side, I could see someone arguing that looking down *is* a lie sign in some contexts, especially if they're avoiding eye contact. But the description says they're not doing *any* other signs, so it feels more like they're just focused on what they're saying rather than trying to cover up something. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I see—no obvious stress cues, just neutral but engaged posture—I'd guess they're probably telling the truth. Still, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context or hearing their words. Maybe they're just a very composed person, or maybe they're lying really well. I'd say truth-leaning, but I'd want to hear the rest of the conversation before I'd feel confident.

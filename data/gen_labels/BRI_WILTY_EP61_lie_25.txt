Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing here, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how completely still they are—no fidgeting, no shifting, no avoiding eye contact, not even a single blink. Usually, when people are lying, you see *some* tension—maybe they touch their face, look away, or get a little too stiff. But here, they're just... calm. Like they're comfortable answering the question, not stressed about it. That kind of neutral, steady presence often lines up with honesty, especially in casual settings. It feels like they're just being themselves, not trying to hide anything.

But then again, I know some people are really good at hiding it. Maybe they've practiced so much that they've learned to suppress all those natural reactions, or maybe they're just naturally low-key and don't show much emotion anyway. I mean, if someone's lying *and* they're super composed, they might look exactly like this—no tells at all. It's tricky because the absence of cues could mean truth *or* a very controlled lie. I've seen people who seem completely relaxed while lying, and others who look tense even when being honest. Without more context—like what they're being asked about or how they usually act—I can't rule out that they're just really good at it. 

Honestly, though, the way they're sitting there, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles, just straightforward and present... it feels more like truth to me. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's possible they're hiding it so well that it's not showing, but the lack of *any* nervousness makes me think it's more likely they're being honest. I'd say maybe 60-40 on truth, but I'm not ruling out the other side completely. It's just hard to say for sure without knowing the situation.

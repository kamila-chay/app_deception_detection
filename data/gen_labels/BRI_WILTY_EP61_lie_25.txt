Honestly, while I'm not entirely certain, I'm leaning more toward the possibility that they might be lying. The fact that they remain completely still—no fidgeting, no shifting, no eye contact avoidance, not even a blink—strikes me as a bit unusual. Typically, people show at least some subtle signs of tension when they're not being truthful, like touching their face, looking away, or showing slight stiffness. Their calmness here seems almost too controlled, as if they're deliberately maintaining a composed facade rather than simply being at ease.

Of course, it's true that some individuals are exceptionally good at masking their feelings, either through practice or naturally low expressiveness, which could explain the absence of any obvious tells. A very controlled liar might present exactly this kind of steady demeanor, making it difficult to tell. The lack of nervous cues could just as easily indicate a well-rehearsed deception as it could genuine honesty.

Given all this, the straightforward and present way they sit could be part of a carefully maintained front rather than outright truthfulness. While I can't be fully confident, the unusual steadiness makes me lean a bit toward them not being entirely forthcoming. Without more context or knowledge of how they usually act, it's hard to be conclusive, but my inclination is gently toward deception here.

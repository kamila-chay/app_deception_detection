Watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. They smile slightly, which can sometimes be a way to appear more likable or mask nervousness, even if the smile isn’t exaggerated. Their eye contact is mostly steady, which often suggests truthfulness, but the occasional sideways glances and head tilt could hint at some underlying discomfort or an attempt to manage how they’re perceived. While they don’t exhibit more obvious signs of deception like avoiding eye contact entirely, fidgeting, or excessive blinking, the subtle cues—particularly the nuanced smile combined with those glances—make me suspicious. It’s also worth noting that these behaviors might be conscious efforts to seem open and engaged. Though there’s no overt stress in their body language, the mix of signals doesn’t fully convince me that they’re telling the truth. Overall, I wouldn’t say they’re definitively lying, but I do lean toward the possibility that they might not be completely honest.

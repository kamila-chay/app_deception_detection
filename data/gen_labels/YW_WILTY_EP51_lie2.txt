Looking at this clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what I'm noticing. The person seems to be talking to someone directly, and their eyes are mostly on the other person—that feels like a good sign for truthfulness, right? But then there's this thing where they keep raising their eyebrows a lot, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying. It's not a big, obvious raise, but it's frequent. And their mouth... the corners are pulled up a tiny bit, like they're forcing a smile, but not really smiling—like they're trying to seem friendly while they talk. That feels a little off, honestly. 

Then there's the gaze shift: they look down a lot while talking, not just glancing away, but really directing their eyes downward. I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes avoid direct eye contact, so that could point to deception. But wait—maybe they're just thinking hard about their answer, or feeling shy, not necessarily lying. Like, if they're nervous about the topic, that downward gaze might just be them gathering their thoughts, not hiding something. 

The lack of other classic "lying" signs is interesting too. No fidgeting, no blinking a lot, no awkward pauses. If they were really lying, I'd expect more physical tension—like touching their face or shifting around. But they're pretty still, which makes me wonder if they're actually being truthful and just... nervous. The raised eyebrows might just be their natural expression when they're concentrating. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up for me. The eyebrow raises and forced smile could be deception cues, but the direct gaze and lack of other tells make it feel more like they're just uncomfortable with the question, not lying. I wouldn't bet on it either way—I'd need more context, like what they're actually saying. But based on the behavior alone, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, maybe because the gaze toward the other person feels too consistent for someone who's trying to cover up something. Still, I'm not confident. It's easy to misread these things, especially if they're good at controlling their face. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'd be really cautious about it.

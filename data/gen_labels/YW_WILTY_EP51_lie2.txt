Looking at this clip, I'm not completely certain, but some of the signs make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. They do maintain eye contact with the other person, which typically suggests truthfulness, but the frequent eyebrow raises come across as a bit suspect—almost like mild surprise or skepticism about what they're saying, which can sometimes signal discomfort or dishonesty. The slight, seemingly forced smile also feels off, as if they're trying too hard to appear friendly or sincere. 

Their downward gaze while talking stands out as well. It's more than just a casual glance away—it feels like they're deliberately avoiding direct eye contact at times, which is often noted as a cue for lying. Of course, it could just mean they're thinking hard or feeling shy, but combined with the other signals, it adds some reason for doubt. 

Interestingly, there aren’t many classic signs of lying like fidgeting or excessive blinking, and their overall stillness might suggest nervousness rather than outright deception. Still, that nervousness could itself be linked to fabricating an answer. The raised eyebrows might be habitual, but tied with the forced smile and downward gaze, it feels like a subtle attempt to mask something. 

So, while I can’t be certain, the blend of these cues nudges me toward thinking they might not be fully truthful here. It’s not a slam dunk by any means, but given the small inconsistencies and avoidance behaviors, I’d cautiously lean toward deception being a possibility.

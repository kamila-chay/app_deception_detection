Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from watching, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. So the person is smiling, which usually feels like a positive sign—people don't often smile when they're lying outright, especially if they're trying to be convincing. They're also nodding a lot, which seems like they're engaged and agreeing with what they're saying, not trying to stall or think of a cover-up. And they keep raising their eyebrows, which I've noticed before can just mean they're emphasizing something or reacting naturally, not necessarily like a "lie sign." But then there's the gaze— they keep looking sideways, not at the person they're talking to. I know some people say that avoiding eye contact is a red flag for lying, so that part makes me pause. Like, maybe they're nervous or hiding something? But wait, they're not frowning, scowling, or blinking a lot—those are the classic "lie" cues I've heard about. If they were making it up, I'd expect more of that restless energy, like scratching their head or covering their mouth. Instead, they seem pretty calm, just a little off-kilter with the sideways glance.  

On the other hand, maybe the sideways gaze isn't about lying at all. I've seen people do that when they're just thinking, or maybe they're not used to being filmed, or it's just their natural way of looking when they're talking. Like, some folks just don't lock eyes when they're being honest—it's not a rule. And the smile and nodting feel genuine, not forced. If they were lying, I'd expect the smile to look stiff or the nod to be too quick, but it seems relaxed. So yeah, the absence of nervous tells is actually kinda reassuring. But I'm not 100% sure—sometimes people are really good at hiding it, or maybe this is a cultural thing where sideways glances aren't a big deal. I mean, it's hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what I see, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It just feels... less "fidgety" than a lie usually looks. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be totally sure.

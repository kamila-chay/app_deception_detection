Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—not because it's obvious, but because the cues they're giving don't match the classic "deception signs" I've heard about. They're making steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels more like engagement than hiding something. And their palms are up, which I've read often signals openness or honesty—like they're trying to show they've got nothing to hide. They're also nodding along, which seems natural for someone listening or agreeing, not like they're forcing it to seem convincing.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Sometimes people who lie *do* overdo eye contact or nod to seem too "on point," like they're rehearsing. And maybe the palms up isn't about honesty—it could just be a nervous habit or a way they naturally gesture. I've also noticed that deception isn't always loud; some people lie without any obvious fidgeting or avoidance, so the *absence* of stress cues might actually be suspicious here. Like, if they were lying, would they really look so calm? But then again, practiced liars often *do* look calm.  

The thing that sticks with me is how relaxed the overall vibe feels—no darting eyes, no lip-biting, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a hint of tension, but they seem pretty composed. Still, I'm not ruling out deception entirely. Maybe they're just really good at it, or maybe the situation isn't actually deceptive at all. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context—like, are they being asked about something they clearly know, or something they're making up?  

So yeah, my gut says truth, but I'd hesitate to call it definitive. It just doesn't *feel* like the classic "lying" behavior I'd expect to see. But if I had to bet, I'd say they're probably telling the truth—though I'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

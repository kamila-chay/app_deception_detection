Honestly, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure it out, but it's tricky. The person is talking, and the only thing that stands out is that their gaze is consistently sideways—like they're looking off to the side of the camera or the person they're talking to, not directly at them. I don't see any classic "liar" tells: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles, no blinking like crazy, nothing where they seem tense or avoiding eye contact in a way that feels unnatural. They're just... looking sideways while they speak. 

At first, I thought, "Hmm, sideways glance might mean they're not being honest," but then I realized: people look sideways all the time when they're thinking, or maybe the lighting's off, or they're just used to not making direct eye contact. I've seen friends do that when they're just trying to recall something, not because they're lying. And since they're not doing anything else weird—no lip-biting, no shifting in their seat, no nervous laughter—it feels like they're just... being relaxed in their own way. 

But here's where I'm not sure: what if the sideways glance *is* a sign of discomfort? Like, maybe they're trying to hide something, and that's why they're not looking straight at the person? I mean, some people do look away when they're lying, but others do it when they're just thinking. It's not a solid sign either way. And honestly, the absence of *other* tells makes me lean toward them being truthful—like, if they were lying, I'd expect *more* nervous energy, not less. But I can't rule out that sideways thing entirely. 

So yeah, I'd probably lean toward them telling the truth just because they seem calm and consistent, but I'm not 100% sure. It's not like they're acting suspiciously, but it's also not a huge red flag for truthfulness either. Hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're being honest. Still, I'd want to see the whole conversation to be more confident.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty engaged while speaking—they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels like they're trying to connect or be clear. They also nod a few times while they're talking, like they're agreeing with themselves or emphasizing points, which usually happens when someone's being genuine. Their eyebrows go up a couple of times too, which might just be natural surprise or emphasis, not something I'd usually associate with lying.  

That said, I'm not totally sure. Sometimes people who are lying *do* make more eye contact to seem convincing, so the steady gaze could technically be a red herring. And the raised eyebrows—while not a classic "lie sign"—could maybe be a nervous habit for them. But what stands out to me is how *calm* they seem: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no avoiding the gaze, and they're not even smiling or laughing unnaturally. Most of the classic "lie tells" (like looking away, touching their face, or tense mouth) are completely absent here.  

Honestly, if I had to guess based on just this clip, it feels more like they're telling the truth. The way they're holding eye contact while nodding—like they're actively listening to their own words—makes it seem like they're not rehearsing or hiding anything. But I'm not going to claim it's 100% certain; people can be good at faking composure. Still, the absence of those nervous cues really makes it lean toward truthful for me. It’s not the *only* thing, but it’s the strongest signal I’m picking up from the video.

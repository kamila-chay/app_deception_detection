Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. They're smiling a bit—lip corners up—and they're looking right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels more genuine than avoiding eye contact. They're also nodding along, which often matches agreement or sincerity in conversations. The chin lift feels a little odd at first—like they're trying to seem confident—but it doesn't seem forced, and it's paired with steady eye contact, so maybe it's just them being earnest.  

That said, I'm not entirely convinced. The way they're looking up and down a lot could be a sign of thinking hard, which sometimes happens when people are fabricating details. And the chin moving up... I've heard some people say that's a nervous tic, though it's not super clear here. If they were lying, I might expect more fidgeting or a tighter smile, but they're not doing any of that—no exaggerated eyes, no awkward pauses, just calm, consistent gestures.  

Honestly, it's tricky. The signs for truth are stronger here—smile, eye contact, nodding—but I can't rule out that the gaze patterns might be masking something. I'd probably say "truth" just because the behavior feels relaxed overall, but I'd still wonder if they're just really good at hiding it. Like, it doesn't *feel* like lying, but I wouldn't bet money on it either. It's one of those cases where the absence of obvious lies feels more telling than the presence of "truth" cues.

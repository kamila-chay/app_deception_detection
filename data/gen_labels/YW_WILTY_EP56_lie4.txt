Honestly, while the person appears calm and engaged—with direct eye contact, nodding, open palm gestures, and a slight, seemingly genuine smile—these signs alone might not tell the whole story. The lack of typical nervous behaviors could suggest truthfulness, but it's also possible they're skilled at maintaining a composed demeanor to mask deception. The smile might be more of a social mask than a genuine expression, and the open gestures and nodding could be deliberate attempts to appear cooperative and trustworthy rather than true indicators of honesty. Given that some people who lie are adept at using these kinds of behaviors to their advantage, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that this person might be hiding something. While I can’t be certain, the cues don’t definitively rule out deception, so I would tentatively suspect they might not be entirely truthful.

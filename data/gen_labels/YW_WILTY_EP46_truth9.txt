Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, though I can see why someone might question it. The person has a lot of open, non-defensive body language—palms up, arms open, and they're making steady eye contact with the person they're talking to. That usually feels more like someone being genuine, not hiding something. Their chin moves up a bit when they speak, which sometimes happens when people are emphasizing a point or feeling a little animated, but it doesn't seem forced. And their lip corners are slightly up, like they're nodding along or agreeing, but it's not a full smile—so it doesn't feel fake or rehearsed.  

But here's where I hesitate: they're raising their eyebrows a lot, and some people think that's a sign of nervousness or even deception. I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes mean someone's trying to seem innocent, especially if they're not smiling. And they're looking up a bit while talking—that's another thing people debate; some say it's a sign of fabricating a story, while others just think it's how people think. Still, they don't seem fidgety at all—no blinking too much, no hands covering their face, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tells," like avoiding eye contact or crossing arms.  

On the flip side, maybe the openness is actually a tactic to seem trustworthy, like they're overcompensating. But the fact that they're not doing anything *too* exaggerated—like over-the-top gestures or fake laughter—makes me doubt that. It just feels... natural. Like they're calmly explaining something they believe in. I mean, I'm not an expert, but the cues I *do* see point more toward truth than deception, especially since the other common signs of lying are completely absent. Still, I'd want to hear the context of what they're saying before I'd be totally convinced. Honestly, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd keep an open mind—people can be convincing when they're lying, and I'm not watching the whole conversation.

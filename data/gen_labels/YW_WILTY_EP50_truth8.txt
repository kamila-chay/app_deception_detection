From what I'm seeing in the clip, the person seems pretty calm and engaged—like they're really focused on whoever they're talking to, which matches the direct eye contact they're holding. They've got their palms up, which usually feels like an open, non-threatening gesture, and they're raising their eyebrows a bit, which could just be natural surprise or emphasis, not necessarily nervousness. I don't see any of the classic "tells" like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or forced smiles, which makes it feel like they're being straightforward. But honestly, it's tricky—I've heard that some people who lie *practice* keeping their palms open and making eye contact to seem credible, so it could be a calculated move. Also, the lack of smiling or laughter might just mean they're serious about the topic, not that they're hiding something. I'm leaning toward truth because the cues all line up with calm honesty, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at faking it. Like, if I were in a room with them, I'd probably trust them more than not, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just feels... genuine, but not 100% guaranteed.

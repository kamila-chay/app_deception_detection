Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though it's really hard to say for certain. The thing that stands out is how calm they seem overall. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact (the camera angle shows they're looking straight ahead without darting eyes), and they don't have any of those classic "nervous" tells like scratching their face, crossing arms, or even a forced smile. The only thing that catches my eye is that they're blinking a lot—frequent blinking is listed in the data—but I've noticed that happens to people all the time when they're just concentrating or maybe tired, not necessarily when they're lying. Like, if someone's nervous, they usually do more than just blink; they might rub their neck, look away, or seem tense, but here they're just... steady. 

That said, I can see why someone might think they're lying. Frequent blinking *can* sometimes be a stress response, especially if they're trying to hide something. But the absence of other cues makes me doubt that. If they were lying, I'd expect them to seem a bit more off—like maybe shifting in their seat, hesitating, or having a weird tone of voice. But the video shows them speaking normally, with no awkward pauses or tense body language. It’s almost like they’re just being straightforward, which feels more natural for truth-telling. 

The counterargument is that maybe the blinking is a subtle tell they're trying to mask—like they're nervous but covering it up by blinking fast to seem calm. But honestly, that feels like stretching it. Without any other signs, it’s way more likely they’re just blinking a lot for a harmless reason. I’ve seen people blink like that when they’re in a bright room or just thinking hard, and it doesn’t mean a thing. So yeah, I’d probably say they’re telling the truth, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It’s one of those cases where the *lack* of obvious lies is actually the strongest clue.

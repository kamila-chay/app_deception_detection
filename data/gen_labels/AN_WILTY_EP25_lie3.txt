Looking at the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky to tell from just the video. They seem pretty still overall, which is interesting because when people lie, they often fidget or do nervous things, but here they're not scratching their head or fiddling with their hands at all. Instead, they keep their gaze locked on the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, but I know that's not always true—some liars overdo eye contact to seem sincere. 

What stands out to me is how they raise their eyebrows a few times and kind of widen their eyes exaggeratedly, like they're trying to look extra open or surprised. It feels a little forced, like they're overcompensating. And their chin dips down a bit, which I've heard can sometimes signal defensiveness or trying to hide something. But then again, maybe they're just naturally expressive—some people have those gestures when they're talking seriously, even if they're telling the truth. Like, maybe they're genuinely trying to emphasize a point, not lying. 

The other thing is, they don't seem nervous in a way that screams deception—no frantic blinking, no awkward pauses, no avoiding eye contact. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs like that, but it's quiet and controlled. Still, the exaggerated eye movements and the chin thing... those do feel a little off for a calm, truthful conversation. I'm torn because it could just be their normal way of talking, but it also doesn't feel *natural* in a way that makes me think, "Yep, they're being honest." 

Honestly, without knowing the context—like what they're talking about or how they usually act—I'd lean toward deception, but I'm not at all confident. It could easily be that they're just a bit anxious about the situation, not lying. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear their voice tone to be sure. Right now, it's a maybe, but leaning toward "not truthful" based on those specific gestures.

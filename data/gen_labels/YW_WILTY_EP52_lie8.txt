Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video. Let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person is nodding a lot while they're talking, which feels like they're trying to seem engaged or confirm what they're saying—truthful people often do that too, though. But the thing that sticks out is how they keep raising their eyebrows, like they're genuinely surprised or maybe trying to seem innocent? I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes be a sign of deception, like they're overcompensating, but honestly, people raise their eyebrows all the time when they're thinking or being expressive, so that alone isn't definitive.  

Then there's the gaze— they're looking at the person they're talking to (which is good for truthfulness), but they keep looking down while doing it. That feels a bit off. Usually, when people are being straightforward, they might glance away briefly, but looking down while maintaining eye contact? It’s like they're avoiding something, but I also wonder if they're just nervous or trying to focus. Nervousness can look like deception, but it’s not the same as lying.  

On the flip side, they’re not doing any of the classic "tells" people expect—no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I’d expect more physical signs, like touching their face or looking away more. The lack of those makes me question it a bit. Maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure? Or maybe they're a really good liar who's hiding it well.  

I keep going back to the eyebrows and the down gaze. If I had to lean toward something, it feels like it *could* be deception—not because of one thing, but the combination. But I’m really not sure. It’s easy to misread body language, and they might just be a person who naturally raises their eyebrows and looks down when they're concentrating. I’d want to hear what they’re saying too, because context matters a lot. Without that, I’m just guessing based on what I see, and I’d say it’s a maybe—leaning slightly toward deception, but with a lot of doubt. It’s hard to say for sure.

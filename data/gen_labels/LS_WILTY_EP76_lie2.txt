Looking at the video, the person is maintaining steady eye contact with the camera the whole time—no shifting gaze, no looking down or away. They're not smiling, not frowning, not blinking much, and they're not fidgeting with their hands or face at all. It’s… really calm, almost like they’re just focused on answering directly. At first glance, that steady gaze without any nervous tells *feels* like someone who’s not hiding anything, especially since they’re not trying to overcompensate with smiles or gestures. But then I keep thinking: I’ve heard that some people who lie actually *stare* to seem honest, right? Like they’re trying too hard to look "truthful." So maybe the lack of any micro-expressions is suspicious, not reassuring.  

On the flip side, maybe they’re just naturally reserved—some people don’t show much emotion when they’re telling the truth, especially if they’re used to being on camera or just not expressive by nature. The fact that they’re not avoiding eye contact (which people often do when lying) and aren’t sweating or shifting in their seat… that leans toward truth, but it’s not proof. I mean, I’ve seen people who lie with perfect calm too. It’s hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they’re saying. If they’re just stating a simple fact they know well, like "My name is Alex," the calmness makes sense. But if they’re answering something tricky, that same calmness might feel off.  

Honestly, though, the absence of *any* nervous behaviors—no lip biting, no hand rubbing, no awkward pauses—makes me lean toward them being truthful. It’s not that they’re "acting" innocent; it’s that they’re just… not stressed. Like they’re comfortable with what they’re saying. But I’m not 100% sure. It could still be a very practiced lie, or maybe they’re just really good at hiding it. I’d want to hear the actual words they’re saying to feel more confident, but based on the behavior alone? It feels like truth, but I’d hesitate to call it a certainty. It’s the kind of thing where you’d say, "Yeah, they seem like they’re being straightforward," but you’d still wonder if there’s more behind it.

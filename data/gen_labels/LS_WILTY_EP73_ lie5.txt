Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I just watched, I'm leaning toward them not lying—but I could easily be wrong. The thing that stuck out to me was how they raised their eyebrows a couple of times while answering, especially when asked about the specific detail. I've noticed in other videos or even in real life that people sometimes do that when they're trying to remember something or feel a bit thrown off, but I've also heard that raised eyebrows can be a sign of deception in some contexts. Like, maybe they're nervous about the question and it's showing up as a quick eyebrow lift instead of something more obvious like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact.  

But here's why I'm hesitating: they didn't seem to be avoiding eye contact at all—they kept looking right at the person asking, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. And they spoke smoothly, no awkward pauses or stammering, which is the opposite of what I'd expect if they were making something up. The description I saw earlier mentioned "no frowning" or "no awkward pauses," and that matches what I saw—just a calm, steady delivery with those few eyebrow raises.  

On the flip side, though, maybe those raised eyebrows were just genuine surprise. Like, maybe the question caught them off guard, and they weren't actually lying—they were just processing it. I mean, people raise their eyebrows all the time when they're thinking, not just when they're lying. And if they *were* lying, I'd probably expect more tells—like looking away a lot or touching their face, but they didn't do any of that.  

So yeah, I'm torn. The eyebrow thing makes me wonder, but the lack of other classic "lie" cues makes me think it's probably not. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of the question, but based on what I saw, I'd guess they're telling the truth. But I'd definitely want to see it again or ask more to be certain—this kind of thing is so tricky to read just from a clip.

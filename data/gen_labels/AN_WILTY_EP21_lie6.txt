So, looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up for me. What stands out is that they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—no looking away or avoiding it, which actually goes against that old idea that liars always dodge eye contact. That makes me think maybe they're being honest, or at least trying to seem that way. They also have their palms facing up, like they're open and not hiding anything, which usually reads as genuine in my experience. But then there's the raised eyebrows—like they're genuinely surprised or caught off guard by the question. I've seen that happen when people are telling the truth and just react naturally to something unexpected, but it could also be a nervous tic if they're lying.  

On the flip side, I'm second-guessing because they don't seem overly stressed—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of tension like tight lips or forced smiles. If they were lying, I'd expect some of those cues, but they're just... calm. Maybe they're a good liar who's practiced this? Or maybe they're just not worried about it because they're actually telling the truth. The raised eyebrows might just be their normal reaction to the topic, not deception. I mean, people raise eyebrows all the time when they're thinking or surprised, right? It's not a sure sign of lying.  

But here's where I'm stuck: if they were lying, why would they keep eye contact and have palms up? Those usually signal openness. Maybe they're so confident they're not lying that they don't even think to act nervous. Or maybe the eyebrows are a red herring. Honestly, without more context—like what they're being asked about—I can't be sure. I'd lean toward them being truthful just based on the lack of classic deception signs, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. People are weirdly good at hiding lies sometimes, and I've been wrong before. So yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd guess they're not lying. Still, it's really hard to say for sure without knowing the whole story.

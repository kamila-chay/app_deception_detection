From what I'm seeing in the clip, the person seems pretty engaged while answering—like they're really listening to the question and trying to give a clear response. Their eyes stay fixed on whoever's asking, which usually feels like someone being honest, not dodging. They also tilt their head a bit while talking, which often shows interest or thoughtfulness, not nervousness. There's a slight upward pull at the corners of their mouth too, like they're not frowning or forcing a smile, which feels natural. I don't see any obvious signs of stress either—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird blinking or lip-biting.  

But honestly, it's not 100% clear-cut. That slight lip retraction (like they're pulling their lips back a tiny bit) could be a nervous habit for some people, though it doesn't look exaggerated. And raised eyebrows can sometimes happen when someone's surprised by a question, not necessarily lying. If I didn't know the context, I might wonder if they're just being polite or trying to seem calm.  

Still, the direct eye contact and lack of other "tells" make me lean toward them being truthful. People who lie often shift their gaze or fidget more, but here they're steady and relaxed. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's always room for misreading someone's natural behavior. Like, maybe they're just a calm person, or maybe they're good at hiding it. But based on what I see, I'd guess they're telling the truth.

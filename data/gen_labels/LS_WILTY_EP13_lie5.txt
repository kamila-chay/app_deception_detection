After watching the clip a few times, I'm not entirely sure, but I keep noticing some things that make me lean toward deception. The person seems really tense—like they're blinking way more than normal, almost like they're trying not to look at the camera or the person they're talking to. Their eyebrows are raised a lot, which feels like they're putting on a "surprised but innocent" act, and their lips are pulled down slightly, like they're holding back a frown. They also keep lifting their chin up, almost like they're trying to appear confident, but it comes off a bit forced. And that head tilt? It's not relaxed; it feels like they're overthinking every word. All those little nervous habits—blinking, chin movement, the tension around the mouth—usually add up to stress, and stress often comes with lying, right?

But here's why I'm not totally convinced: they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time. Most people who lie avoid eye contact, so that feels counterintuitive. If they were really trying to hide something, I'd expect them to glance away or look down. Instead, they're locked in, which makes me wonder if they're just nervous about the situation—not necessarily lying. Maybe they're being grilled about something they're genuinely uncomfortable with, like a mistake at work, and that's why they're fidgeting. The lip corners down and chin lift could just be frustration from being asked a tough question, not deception.  

Honestly, it's tricky. The stress signs are strong, but the eye contact is throwing me off. I'd probably need to see more context—like what they're being asked about—to feel confident. But based on the behavior alone, I'd guess deception is possible, though not 100% certain. Like, it feels like they're trying too hard to seem calm, which is weird when they're being direct with their gaze. Maybe they're lying, but maybe they're just really anxious. I'd say "probably" but not "definitely."

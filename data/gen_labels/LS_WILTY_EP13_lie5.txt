After watching the clip a few times, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. They appear quite tense, blinking much more than usual as if trying to avoid direct interaction, even though they do maintain eye contact. Their raised eyebrows seem to suggest a forced expression of surprise or innocence, while the slight downturn of their lips looks like they're suppressing negative emotions. The way they keep lifting their chin strikes me as an attempt to project confidence, but it comes across as somewhat unnatural. Their head tilt also doesn’t feel relaxed; instead, it seems calculated, like they’re carefully choosing their words. These subtle signs of nervousness—excessive blinking, chin movements, tightness around the mouth—typically signal stress, which often correlates with dishonesty.

On the other hand, the fact that they maintain steady eye contact is unusual for someone who’s lying, since many avoid locking eyes. This could mean they’re just anxious about the situation rather than outright deceptive. Maybe they’re uncomfortable with the topic or under pressure from tough questioning, which could explain the visible tension without necessarily implying deceit.

So, while I’m not completely convinced, the balance of these behavioral cues makes me lean toward the possibility that the person is not being fully truthful. There’s enough here to suggest they might be trying to mask something, even if their direct gaze muddies the picture. I’d say it’s more likely than not that deception is involved, but I wouldn’t call it definitive.

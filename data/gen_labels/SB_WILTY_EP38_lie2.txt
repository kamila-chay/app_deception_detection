This is a bit complicated, but watching the clip, I’m starting to lean towards the idea that the person might be lying. They do show some signs that suggest honesty, like keeping their arms open and maintaining gaze on the other person, which typically signal openness and engagement. However, the subtle head movements—tilting and pulling back slightly—combined with the frequent eyebrow raises seem a little off. Those eyebrow movements feel somewhat exaggerated, almost as if they’re trying to appear calm or sincere while actually feeling nervous or skeptical. 

The open arms are usually a strong indicator of truthfulness, but it’s important to remember that practiced liars can appear open and relaxed to mask their deception. The combination of these cues—the controlled yet inconsistent head motions paired with the intense eyebrow action—raises suspicion. While the person does show some confident body language, it could be part of an effort to seem convincing rather than genuine. 

So, although there are moments that suggest honesty, the overall impression makes me tilt more toward them being deceptive, even if it’s not certain. Without more context or verbal cues, it’s difficult to be definitive, but based on this nonverbal behavior alone, I lean toward the possibility that they are not telling the full truth.

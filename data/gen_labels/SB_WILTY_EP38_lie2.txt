Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip now, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person seems engaged—they're nodding along, keeping their gaze mostly on the other person, and their arms are open, which usually feels like they're being receptive or honest. But then there's this thing with their head: they keep tilting it slightly and actually moving their head backward a bit, like they're pulling away just a tiny bit. And they're raising their eyebrows a lot—more than I'd expect in a normal conversation, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about something they're saying. That part makes me wonder if they're rehearsing or trying to seem calm while they're actually nervous.

On the flip side, though, their chin is moving up sometimes, which can look like confidence, not nervousness. And the open arms really stand out—they're not crossed or tense at all, which often happens when people are hiding something. Gaze down might just mean they're thinking hard, not lying, especially since they're still looking at the person they're talking to most of the time. I've seen people do the eyebrow thing when they're just being expressive, not when they're lying. Like, maybe they're genuinely processing what they're saying, or they're just naturally expressive.

I guess the thing that keeps niggling at me is the combination—head tilting/backward plus the raised eyebrows. It feels a bit *too* controlled, like they're trying to project calm but the little head movements give it away. But then the arms open is such a strong counterpoint... I mean, if they were lying, wouldn't they be more closed off? Still, I've heard that people can be deceptive while still looking open, especially if they're practiced. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them not lying—because the arms open and the steady gaze toward the other person feel more like genuine engagement—but I can't rule out deception entirely. It's really ambiguous. Maybe they're just a very expressive person who's a bit anxious about the topic, not necessarily lying. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words to feel more confident, but based on this alone? I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's hard to tell from just the body language alone.

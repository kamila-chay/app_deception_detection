Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty animated with their eyes—those exaggerated openings stand out, like they're really trying to make their eyes look wide open, which feels a bit forced. Their chin is moving up and down a lot, almost like they're nodding without moving their head, which I've noticed before can happen when someone's rehearsing or feeling pressured. And yeah, they keep covering their mouth with their hands—like they're trying to hold something back. That's a classic sign people often do when they're not being truthful, right? It's that little instinct to physically block themselves from saying the wrong thing.  

But then there's the arms open thing—they're holding their arms wide, like they're trying to look approachable or innocent. And they're keeping eye contact the whole time, which usually makes people seem more honest, not less. I mean, if they were lying, you'd expect them to look away, but they're staring right at the camera. That part feels like it might be working against the deception.  

The head shaking is another thing—like they're saying "no" to something, but it's not clear what. It could just be a nervous habit, not necessarily related to lying. And the chin movement... I've seen people do that when they're just thinking hard, not necessarily hiding something.  

So yeah, the mouth-covering and the exaggerated eyes make me lean toward deception, but the open arms and steady eye contact make me hesitate. It's not like they're avoiding eye contact or fidgeting with their hands in a way that screams "guilty." Maybe they're just a very expressive person, or maybe they're genuinely nervous about the question but not lying. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure—I'd need more context, like what they're actually saying or how they usually act. But based on what I see, the mouth covering and the forced eye movements feel more suspicious than the open arms, so I'm leaning toward them not being completely truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those things where the behavior *suggests* deception, but it's not definitive.

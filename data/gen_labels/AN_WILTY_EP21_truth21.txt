Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people can look uncomfortable even when they're telling the truth—like when they're sharing something hard or sad. Right now, they're not smiling or laughing, which makes me lean toward truth because liars sometimes force a smile to seem relaxed, but they're not doing that here. Their eyebrows are furrowed, and their lips are pulled down at the corners—that looks like genuine frustration or sadness, not the kind of neutral or fake expression I'd expect from someone trying to hide something. They're also looking directly at the camera (or whoever they're talking to) and occasionally glancing up, which feels like they're being honest and trying to connect, not avoiding eye contact like some people do when they're lying.  

That said, I'm not totally sure. The head shaking is a bit confusing—I see them shaking their head, which could be a natural "no" gesture while explaining something, but it might also be a nervous habit. Sometimes people shake their head when they're stressed, even if they're telling the truth. And the "gaze up" thing—I've heard people say looking up means you're making things up, but I'm not sure if that's actually true; it might just be how they think through what they're saying. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting, like touching their face or blinking a lot, but they're pretty still with their hands by their sides. No awkward pauses either—they're speaking smoothly.  

All that said, the absence of classic "lie signs" (like avoiding eyes, fake smiles, or nervous gestures) makes me think they're probably being truthful. But I can't rule out that the head shaking or their sad expression is just them being emotional about the topic, not deception. It feels like they're genuinely upset about whatever they're discussing, which lines up with truth-telling more than lying. Still, I'd want to see more context to be 100% sure—like what they're actually saying—because behavior alone isn't always perfect. But based on the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. On first glance, they're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that feels like it could be a sign they're being genuine, since I've heard that people who lie sometimes avoid eye contact. But then there's that frequent blinking they're doing, which I've read is sometimes linked to stress or deception. It's not constant, but it's noticeable enough that I keep noticing it. 

At the same time, their mouth is pulled down at the corners, which looks kind of neutral or even slightly tense, but not like a forced smile or a scowl. And they keep shaking their head—like a definite "no" motion—while also leaning their head back a bit. That head movement feels a little defensive, like they're physically pulling away from the conversation, which could hint at discomfort or maybe even disagreement. But I'm not sure if that's because they're lying or just because they're nervous about being filmed. 

I also keep thinking about the lack of other "deception cues" they're showing. No fake laughter, no exaggerated gestures, no hands covering their face or rubbing their necks. If they were really trying to hide something, I'd expect more of those nervous habits. Instead, they seem pretty still otherwise, which actually makes me lean toward them being honest—people who are lying often fidget more. But then again, some liars are really good at staying calm, so that's not a guarantee. 

The thing that's really throwing me off is the head shaking. If they're saying "no" while leaning back, it feels like they're dismissing the question or the person, which could be because they're lying. But it could also just be their natural way of emphasizing something they're saying is true. Like, maybe they're saying "I didn't do it" and shaking their head to stress that point, which would be honest. Without hearing what they're actually saying, it's hard to tell if that head motion matches their words. 

Honestly, I'm not sure. The blinking and head movement make me wonder, but the eye contact and lack of other nervous tells make me hesitate. It's easy to jump to conclusions about lying based on one or two cues, but I know from what I've read that deception is way more complicated than that. They could just be tired or stressed about the situation, not necessarily lying. I'd need more context—like what they're talking about or how they're acting in the rest of the clip—to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward "maybe not lying," but I'm not ruling it out either. It's just... hard to say for sure.

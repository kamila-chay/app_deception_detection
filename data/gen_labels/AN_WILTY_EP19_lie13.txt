Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn on whether this person is lying or not. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's actually a pretty strong sign of honesty in most situations, right? Like, when people are being deceptive, they often avoid looking directly at you. And they're nodding along while they speak, which feels like genuine engagement, not someone trying to stall or think of a story. Their palms are up the whole time too, which usually reads as open and honest—like they're not hiding anything. Plus, they're touching their head or neck a few times, but that seems more like a natural gesture, maybe just adjusting their hair or feeling a bit self-conscious, not something I'd immediately flag as nervousness from lying.

But then... I can't shake the feeling that maybe I'm missing something. Sometimes people who are lying *do* mimic those "honest" behaviors to seem credible—like forcing eye contact or nodding to seem cooperative. And that head-touching... it's not super frequent, but it's there. I've heard that touching your face or neck can sometimes be a subconscious sign of stress, even if it's not as obvious as fidgeting with hands or avoiding eyes. Maybe they're trying too hard to seem calm? The fact that they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" like blinking a lot or frowning makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I know those signs aren't foolproof. Like, some people just don't blink much naturally, or they're just really good at staying calm under pressure.

Honestly, I'd probably say they seem like they're telling the truth based on what I'm seeing—no red flags jumping out at me—but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's hard to say for sure without more context. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward "truth," but I'd be totally open to being wrong. Like, maybe they're just a very composed person, or maybe the deception is subtle and I'm just not picking up on it. Either way, it's not the kind of clip where you'd immediately think "definitely lying." It feels... neutral, maybe? Like they're just answering a question without any obvious tension. But yeah, I'm still not 100% sure.

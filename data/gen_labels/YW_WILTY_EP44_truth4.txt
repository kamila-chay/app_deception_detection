Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how they're looking right at the camera the whole time—like, they're not avoiding eye contact or glancing away, which is actually a pretty strong sign of honesty for most people. And they're nodding along while they talk, which feels natural, not forced. I also noticed they were moving their head forward and back a bit while speaking, like they're really engaged in the conversation, which seems genuine. 

But here's where I hesitate: they blinked a lot—like, way more than normal. I know some people say frequent blinking can be a sign of lying, like when someone's stressed or trying to think of what to say. So at first, I thought, "Hmm, maybe they're nervous about being caught in a lie?" But then I remembered that people also blink a lot when they're just anxious about being filmed or in an interview setting, even if they're being honest. Like, I've done it myself when I'm talking to a camera—I get extra nervous, and my eyes just start blinking like crazy. 

Also, they didn't do any of the classic "lying" stuff: no frowning, no lip biting, no looking down or away, no hands covering their mouth. The absence of those tells makes me think it's less likely they're lying. If they were trying to hide something, they'd probably try to control their expressions more, but here it just looks like they're speaking casually. 

That said, I'm not 100% confident. Some really skilled liars can mimic natural eye contact and nodding, and the blinking *could* still be a red flag. Maybe they're just really tense about the whole situation, not necessarily lying. But based on what I saw—no obvious deception cues, consistent eye contact, and natural head movements—I'd guess they're being truthful. It's not a slam dunk, but it feels more like nervousness than deception to me.

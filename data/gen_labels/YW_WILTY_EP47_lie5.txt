Hmm, this is a tough one. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not. The person seems a bit... off, but it's hard to tell without knowing the context of what they're saying. Let me break down what I'm noticing.

They're definitely making eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time, which is good, but then they keep glancing sideways too—like they're looking away briefly while still seeming to focus on the other person. That sideways glance feels a little odd, maybe like they're avoiding something? And their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently, which usually means surprise or skepticism, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're just thinking hard or trying to seem engaged. 

Then there's the head movement—definitely shaking their head "no" a couple of times, and turning their head sideways a bit. Head shaking is super common when disagreeing or clarifying, so it might just mean they're correcting something they said earlier, not that they're deceptive. The chin moving up slightly—like a little lift—could be nervousness or just a natural gesture when speaking. I don't see any of the classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or overacting. No fake smiles, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed, nothing like that. 

But here's why I'm still unsure: sometimes when people are lying, they *do* use subtle head movements or raised brows to seem more convincing, especially if they're trying to appear calm. The sideways gaze might even be a sign they're constructing a story. On the flip side, they could just be naturally expressive—some people have a habit of raising their eyebrows or turning their head when they talk, and it's totally innocent. Maybe they're just stressed about the question, not lying. The fact that they're keeping eye contact most of the time actually leans toward truthfulness, since people often avoid eye contact when lying. 

I think I'd lean toward them *not* lying, but I'm not confident at all. The cues are too mixed. If I had to guess without context, I'd say the head shaking and sideways glance might just be part of their normal speech pattern, not deception. But if this was a high-stakes situation, like a police interview, I'd be more suspicious. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure—without knowing what they're being asked about, it's like reading tea leaves. I'd be hesitant to call it deception based on this alone.

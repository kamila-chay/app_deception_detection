This is a challenging situation, but after watching the clip closely, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t say so with absolute certainty. While they maintain eye contact most of the time, which usually suggests honesty, their frequent sideways glances strike me as somewhat unusual—these could be subtle signs of avoidance or maybe an attempt to mentally piece together a story. The raised eyebrows, often linked to surprise or skepticism, could also be a way to appear more convincing rather than a genuine reaction.

Their head movement, such as the shaking “no” and slight head turns, might simply be gestures of disagreement or explanation, but these same cues can sometimes be used strategically when someone is fabricating information. The slight chin lift might indicate nervousness, which can be consistent with deception, though it isn’t definitive on its own. The absence of classic telltale signs—like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact—complicates the picture, but deception doesn’t always follow predictable patterns.

It’s possible these behaviors are just part of their natural way of communicating or signs of stress unrelated to lying, but the combination of the sideways glances and certain gestures makes me question the truthfulness a bit more than I might with a straightforward, relaxed demeanor. Without context, it's difficult to be sure, but overall, I find myself leaning slightly toward the person not being entirely truthful, even if I can’t conclusively say they are lying.

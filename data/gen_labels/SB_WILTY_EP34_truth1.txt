Honestly, I'm not sure if I'd call this a clear case of lying or truth—there are some cues that make me lean toward truth, but others that could go either way. The person's eyes are really active: they're raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking frequently, which sometimes happens when people are stressed or trying to think, but it's not a sure sign of deception. Like, I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating or even surprised, not necessarily lying. Then there's the lip corners down—they look a bit tight or serious, which might just mean they're focused or a little tense, not that they're hiding something.  

But what stands out more is how they're looking at the person they're talking to—direct eye contact (gaze toward interlocutor) and glancing up a bit, which I've heard is often linked to recalling actual memories, not making things up. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance of eye contact or maybe more fidgeting, but their hands are still, and they're not shifting around much. The lack of a smile or laugh also feels genuine to me—like they're being straightforward, not trying to charm anyone.  

On the flip side, the frequent blinking and raised brows *could* be nervousness, and I know some people get those reactions when they're lying. But honestly, those signs are super common in everyday stress—maybe they're just tired or in a room with bright lights. And the lip corners down? Could be sadness or just a natural resting face, not deception. I'm not a lie detector, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're just being honest and maybe a little anxious, not actively lying. Still, it's hard to say for sure—people's baseline behaviors vary so much. I'd lean toward truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just doesn't scream "lying" to me like some other clips do.

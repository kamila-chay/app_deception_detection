Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% sure, but it *feels* like they're being truthful. The way they're holding their gaze directly at the person they're talking to—no looking away or up too much, which can sometimes signal fabrication—stands out. They're nodding along, and their head movements seem natural, like they're genuinely engaged in the conversation, not rehearsing. The mouth being closed with those little pauses doesn't scream "lying" to me; it just looks like someone thinking carefully before speaking, which honest people do all the time. And the way their chin dips down a bit while they talk, plus those lips slightly pushed out, seems like a relaxed, thoughtful expression—not the tense, forced look I'd expect if they were hiding something.

But I can see why someone might doubt it. The lack of any smile or obvious warmth *could* be a red flag—like they're being overly cautious or hiding their emotions. Some people who lie try to seem neutral to avoid giving themselves away, so that absence of expression might make you wonder. And those "awkward pauses" with the mouth shut... well, liars sometimes pause to think of their next line, so it's not impossible it's a sign of fabrication. Plus, the gaze up thing—while often linked to remembering real events (which truth-tellers do), some liars actually fake that too, trying to look "thoughtful." 

Still, the bigger picture feels more consistent with truth-telling. There's no fidgeting, no darting eyes, no hands covering the face, which are classic signs of stress or deception. The head movements—tilting, side-turning, nodding—are all fluid and purposeful, like they're actually listening and responding. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, but this just looks like someone being a little reserved while they think. Honestly, it's the *absence* of red flags that tips me toward truth more than anything. But yeah, I'm not ruling out the other side—it's never 100% clear from video alone. I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

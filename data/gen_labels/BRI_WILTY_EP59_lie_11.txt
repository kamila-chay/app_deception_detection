Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll walk through my thoughts. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—that's one thing that stands out. Usually, when people are being deceptive, they might avoid eye contact or look away a lot, but here they're actually looking directly at the interlocutor most of the time. That makes me lean a bit toward them being truthful, though I know some skilled liars do maintain eye contact to seem credible. 

I also noticed they raised their eyebrows a couple of times, especially when answering a specific question. At first, I wondered if that was a classic "lie sign," but I've read that raised eyebrows can just mean surprise, confusion, or even trying to seem engaged—not necessarily deception. It could be they genuinely didn't expect that question, so they're processing it. And they glanced sideways once or twice, which sometimes gets flagged as evasive, but honestly, that feels like a natural habit for some people—like they're thinking or just shifting their gaze without meaning to avoid anything. 

On the flip side, I can see why someone might think they're lying. The sideways glances *do* feel a bit off if you're looking for deception cues, and the eyebrow raises might seem overly animated if you're expecting a neutral reaction. But then again, they didn't fidget, cross their arms, or seem tense at all—those are usually bigger red flags for me. No awkward pauses, no lip-biting, no fake smiles. If they were making something up, I'd expect more physical tells. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The eye contact is the strongest counter to deception here, but I'm not going to rule out that they're being deceptive just because they're looking at the camera. Some people are just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, and the sideways glance might just be how they think. I'd probably need to hear more of the conversation or see them in a different context to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because of the consistent eye contact and lack of nervous gestures, but I'm definitely not 100% sure—it could easily be a case where they're lying but doing it smoothly. I'd say it's a maybe, not a definite yes or no.

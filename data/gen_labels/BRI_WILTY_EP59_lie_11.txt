Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m leaning slightly toward the person being deceptive, though I can't say for certain. While they do maintain consistent eye contact, which often suggests honesty, some skilled liars deliberately keep eye contact to appear credible. The raised eyebrows they display, especially when responding to a specific question, might not simply indicate surprise or engagement—it could be a subtle attempt to overemphasize sincerity. The sideways glances, although possibly just a natural habit, can sometimes be a sign of evasiveness or discomfort, which raises some suspicion in this context.

They don't exhibit obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, crossing arms, or awkward pauses, which typically point more clearly toward deception. However, the absence of these doesn’t necessarily confirm honesty, especially if someone is practiced at controlling their body language. Given these mixed signals, I’m inclined to suspect that they might be lying, but they’re doing so in a way that conceals the usual warning signs. Ultimately, it’s not definitive, but my impression leans more toward deception than truthfulness.

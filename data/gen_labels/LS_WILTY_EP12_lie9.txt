Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call without more context, but based on what I'm seeing in the video... I'd lean toward them not being fully truthful, though I'm not 100% sure. Let me explain why I'm hesitant though, because it's easy to misread things. 

First, the way they're looking at the person they're talking to—like, they keep making direct eye contact, which usually feels like someone trying to seem honest. But then they're also glancing sideways quite a bit, which feels off. Like, if they were relaxed and telling the truth, they'd probably just stay focused without those little shifts. The sideways glances make me wonder if they're trying to avoid being caught in a lie, but it's not a full avoidance—more like a mix of "I'm looking at you" and "but I'm not *quite* comfortable." 

Then there's the chin moving down a little when they talk, and the eyebrows raised. I've seen that combo before—like when someone's trying to seem calm or innocent but is actually stressed. The raised eyebrows can feel like a "deer in headlights" thing, and the chin dropping might be a subtle sign of tension. But honestly, I've also seen people do that when they're just thinking hard or feeling a bit awkward, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation, like it's a job interview or something high-pressure, and that's making them fidget a bit. 

The head moving forward when they speak is interesting—it feels engaged, which usually points to truthfulness, but it's hard to separate that from the other cues. If they were lying, they might lean in to seem convincing, but if they're just nervous, they'd lean in too. And the lack of smiling or laughing or frowning makes it feel more neutral, not like they're hiding something through big emotions. 

I guess the counterargument is strong here: it could totally be just them being naturally anxious or distracted. I've definitely had moments where I'd glance sideways while talking because I was thinking about what to say next, not because I was hiding anything. And the direct gaze *is* a good sign for honesty, so it's not all negative. But the combination—direct eye contact *plus* those sideways glances *plus* the chin movement—feels a little inconsistent for someone who's relaxed. It's like they're trying to *seem* honest but their body's giving them away a little. 

So yeah, I'm not saying "they're lying," but I'm more inclined to think there's something they're not saying fully. Like, maybe they're being evasive or omitting details rather than outright lying. But I'd need way more context—like what the conversation's about—to be sure. Without that, I'd say the behavior leans toward deception, but it's definitely not a slam dunk. It's the kind of thing where I'd probably ask myself, "Wait, why *are* they looking sideways like that?" and then wonder if it's just them.

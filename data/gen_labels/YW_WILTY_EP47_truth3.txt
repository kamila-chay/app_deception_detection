Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. So, the person is talking to someone, and their main nonverbal cues seem to be raising their eyebrows a bit, keeping their lips slightly turned up (like a quiet, neutral smile), and maintaining eye contact with the person they're speaking to—though they also glance sideways a few times. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact completely, and there's no obvious sign of tension like scowling or tense jaw. 

On one hand, the fact that they're making consistent eye contact and have that subtle lip-up expression feels... genuine? Like, when people are being truthful, they often don't overcompensate with fake smiles or nervous gestures. The sideways glances might just be them thinking or being expressive, not necessarily hiding something—people do that naturally while talking. And the absence of classic "lie signs" like excessive blinking, avoiding gaze, or hands fidgeting is kind of reassuring. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of discomfort, like shifting in their seat or looking away more often. 

But then again, the eyebrow raise *could* be a bit odd—sometimes people do that when they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical, which might hint at something not adding up. And the sideways gaze... well, some people do that when they're rehearsing what to say, which *could* be a sign of deception. I've seen that before in interviews where someone's being careful with their words. 

Still, the lip corners up feels like the strongest clue—it's not a big smile, but a subtle, relaxed one that often happens when people are just being honest and engaged. If they were lying, they might force a tighter smile or avoid smiling altogether. The direct gaze also seems more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. I mean, I've been in conversations where I glance sideways while thinking, and that's totally normal. It doesn't automatically mean they're lying. 

Honestly, though, it's hard to be 100% sure. Nonverbal cues can be so context-dependent—maybe they're just tired or naturally expressive. But based on what I'm seeing, the lack of nervous ticks and the subtle, natural-looking expressions lean more toward them being truthful. It doesn't scream "lie," and the cues that *are* there (like the gaze and lips) feel more aligned with someone being genuine. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's always room for misreading. Like, maybe they're just nervous about the topic, not lying about it. But yeah, my gut says they're telling the truth.

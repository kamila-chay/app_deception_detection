Looking at the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn on whether they're being truthful or not. On one hand, there are some things that make me lean toward deception—like how they're blinking really frequently and have those furrowed eyebrows mixed with raised ones, which feels like a mix of tension and maybe trying to seem calm. The lips being pushed out a bit and the head shaking side-to-side also stand out; I've noticed people do that when they're rehearsing a story or trying to downplay something. And the way their gaze flicks sideways while still looking at the person? That kind of feels like they're avoiding direct eye contact but not fully, which I've heard can happen when someone's not being straight with you. The head tilting too—like they're processing something carefully—might be a sign they're constructing a response.

But then I keep thinking, maybe it's not about lying at all. Frequent blinking can just mean someone's tired or stressed from the situation, not necessarily lying. I've seen people with dry eyes do that constantly, and this person seems genuinely engaged in the conversation (they're looking at the other person most of the time, which liars sometimes avoid). The head shaking could be a habitual gesture—they might just always do that when they're thinking, like a "hmm" motion. And the lips protruding? Could be frustration from the question itself, not deception. Like, maybe they're annoyed they're being asked about something they don't want to talk about, but that doesn't mean they're lying. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say without knowing the context of what they're being asked. If they're being grilled about something they're nervous about, all these behaviors could just be anxiety. But if it's a situation where they'd have a reason to hide something, it leans the other way. I wouldn't bet the farm on either side—I'd want to see more of the conversation or check if they're consistent with other details. My gut says it's *possible* they're not being truthful, but I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. It just feels like they're off-balance, and that could go either way.

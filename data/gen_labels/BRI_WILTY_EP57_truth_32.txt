Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. What stands out to me is how they're holding their gaze—they're looking right at whoever they're talking to the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty. Like, when people are lying, they often avoid eye contact or glance away, but here they're locked in, which makes me lean toward "truth" at first glance. They also have this little head shake, like a subtle "no" motion, but it doesn't seem aggressive or nervous—it feels natural, like they're just emphasizing a point.  

But then I keep thinking, *what if they're just really good at hiding it?* Sometimes people who lie can actually look calm or even too composed, so the lack of fidgeting or awkward pauses (like lips pressed together or heavy blinking) might not mean anything. The raised eyebrows are interesting—they could be showing surprise at the question, like "Wait, why are you asking that?" which might not be a lie at all. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension, like tight lips or a forced smile, but they're not doing any of that.  

On the flip side, the head shake *could* be a red herring. Like, if they're denying something, the shake might just be part of the denial, not a sign of deception. And honestly, I've seen people shake their heads naturally even when they're telling the truth—like when they're just disagreeing with a thought, not a statement. Plus, the way they're speaking (I can't hear it, but the pauses seem smooth) doesn't feel like someone scrambling for words.  

I guess what keeps me leaning toward truth is that they're not doing *anything* that screams "nervous liar." No hands rubbing, no avoiding eyes, no fake smiles. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those tells, especially in a tense moment. But maybe they're just really practiced or not stressed about it. I'm not 100% certain, though—people are weirdly inconsistent. Like, I've known people who lie with a straight face and zero tells, while others who are totally honest but can't stop blinking.  

So yeah, my gut says they're probably telling the truth, but I'd need to hear the actual words to be sure. The behavior here just doesn't match the classic "lying" checklist, and the steady eye contact is a strong signal. Still, I won't bet my life on it—there are always exceptions.

Hmm, this is tricky to call just from watching. On one hand, the person seems pretty steady—like they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels more like truth-telling to me. They're not fidgeting, avoiding gaze, or doing those little nervous tells like biting lips or covering their mouth. The fact that they're looking up a bit while talking also makes me think they're actually recalling something, which often happens when people are being honest about memories instead of making stuff up. And the head turning sideways? That’s just how people naturally move when they’re thinking or speaking, not something I’d immediately flag as suspicious.

But then there’s that exaggerated eye closing—they close their eyes really wide and slowly, like they’re really *trying* to emphasize something. I’ve heard that sometimes liars do that to avoid eye contact or to create a moment of "thought," so that part makes me pause. Like, is it a genuine gesture or a way to buy time? It’s hard to say without more context though. I’ve also seen people do that when they’re just really focused on what they’re saying, not necessarily lying. And honestly, I know people often misread body language—I’ve been fooled before by someone who looked super calm but was actually hiding something.

So yeah, I’m leaning toward truth because the overall vibe feels calm and engaged, with no obvious red flags like fidgeting or forced smiles. But that eye closing keeps me from being 100% sure. Maybe it’s just their natural way of speaking, and I’m overthinking it. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth, but I wouldn’t bet my lunch money on it. It’s one of those cases where the behavior just *feels* neutral, not deceptive.

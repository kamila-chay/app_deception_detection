Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person is frowning quite a bit—those eyebrows are pulled down tight—and they keep glancing sideways while also looking directly at the person they're talking to. That sideways glance makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact on purpose, which sometimes happens when someone's not being straight with you. But then again, they're actually making eye contact too, which usually feels more honest. I've seen people look away when they're nervous or just thinking, not necessarily lying.  

What stands out to me is how *calm* they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no touching their face, no forced smiles or awkward pauses—they're just sitting there with that steady frown, answering the questions. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a little more tense, maybe blinking a lot or shifting around. But here, they're pretty still, just with that persistent frown. That makes me lean toward thinking they're actually being honest, maybe they're just upset or confused about what they're being asked.  

On the flip side, the sideways glances *do* feel a bit off. Sometimes when people lie, they'll look away to "think" or to avoid the truth, even if they're trying to seem calm. And that frown—could be genuine frustration, but it might also be a way to seem serious to cover up the lie. I mean, I've known people who get that exact look when they're trying to be convincing, even if they're not.  

But here's why I'm still leaning away from deception: the *lack* of classic tells. No lip biting, no hands covering the mouth, no excessive blinking—things I'd usually spot if someone was making something up. Most of the time, when people lie, they give *some* physical clue, even if it's subtle. This feels more like someone who's just... not happy about the situation. Maybe they're being truthful but frustrated, not deceptive.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It could go either way, but based on what I see, I'd be hesitant to call it deception. It just doesn't *feel* like the classic "lying" behavior I've seen before. Could be they're nervous, could be they're actually upset, but I don't see the signs that would make me think they're deliberately hiding something. It's one of those moments where the absence of red flags might actually mean they're being real.

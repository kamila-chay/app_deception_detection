Looking at the clip, I'm not totally sure, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. The person is smiling the whole time, which honestly throws me a bit because I've heard that when people lie, they often have a forced or unnatural smile—like it doesn't reach their eyes. But here, the smile seems pretty relaxed, so that makes me wonder if it's genuine. They're also sitting with their arms crossed the whole time, which feels defensive to me. Like, when I'm nervous or hiding something, I tend to cross my arms, so that part makes me lean toward them not being fully open.  

But then there's the eye contact thing—they're not looking at the person they're talking to at all. I know that avoiding eye contact is a classic "lie" cue people talk about, but I've also heard that some people just don't make eye contact naturally, especially if they're shy or just used to it. Maybe they're just uncomfortable in the setting, not necessarily lying. And the smile... if they were lying, why would they smile so easily? Sometimes people smile to seem friendly when they're nervous, but it could also mean they're actually happy about what they're saying.  

On the flip side, the arms crossed *and* no eye contact together feel like a stronger signal than the smile alone. Like, if they were telling the truth, I'd expect them to look more engaged—maybe even smile while making eye contact. But here, the smile feels disconnected from the rest of their body language. Still, I can't rule out that they're just a naturally closed-off person, or that the situation is just awkward for them.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The smile makes me doubt the deception, but the crossed arms and avoiding eyes make me lean toward it. I'd say it's probably deception, but I wouldn't bet money on it—I'd want to see more context or hear what they're actually saying. It's one of those cases where the cues are mixed, so it's hard to call. If I had to guess, I'd say they might be lying, but I'd be really cautious about it.

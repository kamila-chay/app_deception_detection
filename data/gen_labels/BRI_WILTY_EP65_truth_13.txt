Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they're not doing a lot of the obvious things people associate with lying. Like, they're not fidgeting with their hands, avoiding eye contact, or looking down a lot—those are the classic signs I'd expect if someone was hiding something. Instead, they just have this one thing going on where their eyebrows are raised, like they're genuinely surprised or maybe just processing what they're saying. 

What stands out to me is that they're not showing any of the nervous tells. No forced smiles, no awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words, no blinking too much, nothing like that. When people lie, they often get a bit more tense—maybe their jaw tightens, or they start touching their face—but here, they seem pretty relaxed overall. The raised eyebrows could just be a natural reaction to what they're saying, like "Wait, I really mean this" or "I'm not sure why you'd ask that." It doesn't feel like it's trying to hide anything. 

But I guess I can't be totally sure. Maybe they're a really good liar who's practiced not showing those signs, or maybe they're lying about something they're not even nervous about. Like, if they're telling a story they've rehearsed a hundred times, they might not have any physical tells at all. Or maybe the raised eyebrows are a subconscious way of signaling they're being truthful—some people do that when they're emphasizing honesty. Still, the lack of other cues feels more aligned with truthfulness than deception. 

I mean, I'm not going to say "they're definitely telling the truth," but based on what I'm seeing, it seems like they're not acting suspicious. If anything, the absence of all those "lie" markers makes me lean toward them being honest. But yeah, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context—like, what exactly they're talking about. If it's something super personal or sensitive, even a calm person might act differently. Still, right now, the video doesn't scream "lying" to me. It just feels... neutral, with that one eyebrow thing maybe adding a tiny bit of emphasis. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% certain. It's one of those cases where the silence of the behavior speaks louder than the words.

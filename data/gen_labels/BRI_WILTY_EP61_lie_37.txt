Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. The person in the clip seems really calm—like, unnervingly so. They're not smiling, not frowning, not even blinking much, and they're avoiding eye contact the whole time. It's like they're staring straight through the camera instead of at whoever's asking them questions. Normally, when people are nervous or lying, they might fidget, look away, or give little tells like that, but here it feels... too controlled. Like they're trying *too hard* to seem normal. That kind of stillness can actually be a red flag because honest people usually react a bit more—maybe a slight shift in posture, a quick glance, something. 

But then I keep thinking, maybe they're just not the type to show emotion. Some people are naturally reserved, especially in tense situations. Maybe they're shy, or maybe they're from a culture where direct eye contact isn't the norm. I've seen people who are totally truthful but just don't have those "nervous" habits. And honestly, the absence of tells could mean they're not lying—they're just really good at staying calm. It's hard to say for sure because liars can be super composed too, especially if they've practiced. 

The thing that sticks with me is how they keep their gaze averted. If they were telling the truth, you'd expect at least some attempt to engage, even if they're nervous. But here, it feels like they're deliberately avoiding connection. Still, I can't rule out that they're just uncomfortable with the situation. I'd lean toward deception just because the lack of any reaction feels off—like they're rehearsed or detached—but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those cases where it's almost too "perfect," and that's what makes me wonder. But yeah, it's really ambiguous either way.

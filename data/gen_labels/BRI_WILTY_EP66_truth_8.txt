Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together what's happening. The person doesn't seem to be smiling or laughing, which is interesting because sometimes people fake those when they're uncomfortable. Instead, they're raising their eyebrows a few times—like they're processing something or genuinely surprised—and their head is tilted slightly, which often happens when someone's listening closely or thinking. They're also glancing down a lot, not avoiding eye contact entirely, which I've heard is a common myth about liars (people think they always look away, but it's not that simple). Their head moves back a bit too, like they're leaning away from the camera, but it doesn't seem aggressive or nervous—more like they're just settling into the moment.  

On the flip side, I wonder if the down gaze could be a sign they're hiding something. Sometimes people look down when they're lying to avoid being caught, right? And the head moving backward might feel like a subtle sign of discomfort. But then again, if they were lying, I'd expect more obvious tells—like fidgeting, touching their face, or avoiding eye contact completely. Here, they're not doing any of that. Their mouth is still, no awkward pauses, and their posture feels relaxed. It's weird because most of the classic "lie" cues are absent, which makes me lean toward them being honest. But I can't say for sure—people lie in all sorts of ways, and some are really good at it without showing physical signs.  

Honestly, the more I watch, the less it feels like deception. The eyebrow raises and head tilt seem like natural reactions to what they're saying, not forced. Like, if they were making it up, they might overdo the expressions or seem stiff, but they don't. Still, I'm not going to claim I know for sure. It's possible they're lying and just not showing the usual signs, but based on what's here, it seems more likely they're telling the truth. I'd say it's a maybe, but leaning toward true.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but watching the clip, I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful. The thing that stands out most is how they keep looking sideways—like, their gaze is constantly drifting to the side instead of meeting the other person's eyes. And they're doing this head tilt to the side a few times too, which feels a bit off. When people are being deceptive, they often avoid direct eye contact or shift their gaze like that, almost like they're trying not to be caught. The raised eyebrows too—they're not smiling or frowning, just kind of lifted, which sometimes happens when someone's stressed or trying to think of a story.  

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just really shy or distracted. I've seen people look sideways when they're just thinking hard about something, not necessarily lying. Like, if they're trying to recall a detail, they might not lock eyes with you. And the head tilt could just be a nervous habit they have, not a sign of deception. The video doesn't show any obvious tells like fidgeting or forced smiles, which makes me wonder if I'm overthinking it. Sometimes people get labeled as "lying" for stuff that's totally normal for them.  

Still, the combination of the sideways gaze, the head turn, and those raised eyebrows without any other context... it feels like they're not fully engaged with the conversation, like they're holding something back. But I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's possible they're just uncomfortable in the moment, or maybe the question was awkward. I'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure, but based on what I see here, I'm leaning toward "lie" just because those cues line up with what I've read about micro-signs of deception, even if it's not 100% clear-cut.

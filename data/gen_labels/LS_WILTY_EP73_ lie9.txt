Honestly, I'm not completely certain, but based on the clip, I tend to lean toward the idea that they might not be telling the whole truth. The most noticeable thing is how their gaze keeps drifting sideways instead of making direct eye contact, which can sometimes be a sign of evasiveness. They also tilt their head to the side a few times, which feels a bit unusual in this context. Raised eyebrows without an accompanying smile or frown could indicate stress or the effort of fabricating a story. These behaviors together often appear when someone is trying to conceal something.

That said, there’s some room for doubt. It's possible they are just shy, distracted, or thinking hard, which can also cause similar behaviors like avoiding eye contact or tilting the head. The absence of more obvious signs like fidgeting or forced smiles makes me wonder if these cues are being misinterpreted. People sometimes get mistaken for lying simply because of how they naturally behave.

Still, considering the combination of the sideways gaze, head tilt, and raised eyebrows without clearer explanation, it seems they might not be fully honest. I wouldn’t be entirely confident in this conclusion, but based on these cues, I tend to suspect some level of deception is at play, even if it’s not absolutely certain.

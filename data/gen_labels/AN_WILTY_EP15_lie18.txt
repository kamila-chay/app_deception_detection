Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching, honestly. I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert, but I'll share what jumped out at me. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that usually feels like a sign they're trying to be honest, right? Like, if they were lying, they might avoid looking directly at you. But then there's that thing with the fingers crossed under the table, which I've heard people associate with lying before, like they're secretly hoping it's not true. That's a bit unsettling to see.

They also had these really exaggerated eye openings, like their eyes were wide open way more than normal, and their chin kept jutting up slightly when they spoke. I've seen people do that when they're trying too hard to seem calm or sincere, maybe because they're nervous. The raised eyebrows too—they seemed a bit tense, like they were bracing for something. But wait, raised eyebrows can just mean surprise or confusion, not necessarily lying. Like, if someone asks you a weird question, you might raise them naturally. So that could be innocent.

On the flip side, they weren't fidgeting much—no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or frowns. Those are some classic signs people use when they're lying, so the absence of those makes me wonder if it's not deception after all. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person who's genuinely answering the question, and the crossed fingers were just a habit. I've seen people cross their fingers without even realizing it, like they're just nervous about the conversation, not the truth.

Honestly, the crossed fingers are the strongest thing for me leaning toward deception, but I'm really not sure. Because the direct eye contact and lack of other tells make it feel like it could be honest too. Like, maybe they're just a bit anxious about the topic, and the crossed fingers are just a nervous tic. I'd say it's probably *maybe* deception, but I'd hesitate to say for sure. It's one of those cases where the video feels ambiguous—like, it could go either way depending on context I don't have. I'd need to hear more of what they're saying to feel confident, but based on the body language alone? I'd lean slightly toward it being a lie, but I'd still be skeptical. It's hard to say without more to go on.

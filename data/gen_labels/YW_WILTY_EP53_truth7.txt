Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful. On one hand, their gaze is consistently locked on the person they're talking to—no looking away or up, which usually feels more natural when someone's being honest. And the corners of their mouth are lifted just slightly, like they're genuinely trying to seem calm or friendly, not forced. That part makes me lean toward them telling the truth.  

But then there's the frequent blinking—way more than normal—and those eyebrows are pulled down in a tight frown, like they're really concentrating or stressed. I've heard people blink a lot when they're nervous or trying to remember something, and frowning often shows internal conflict. If they were lying, that could make sense. The chin moving upward too—like they're pushing it up as if to hold themselves together—adds to that uneasy feeling.  

Still, I'm not sure. Maybe they're just tired or genuinely upset about what they're saying, not lying. The lip corners up might be a real, subtle attempt to stay composed, and the steady eye contact could just mean they're being careful with their words. Sometimes people frown when they're thinking hard, not when they're hiding something. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact or doing obvious tells like covering their mouth makes me question the "lying" angle.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The blinking and frown make me wonder, but the gaze and the slight smile feel more consistent with truth. I'd probably lean toward truth, but I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. People are complicated, and these cues can mean different things depending on the situation. If I had to guess without any context, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd still be looking for more clues to feel confident.

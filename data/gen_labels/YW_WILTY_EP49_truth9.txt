Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's tricky because people can be pretty good at hiding things, but I'll share what stood out to me. The person seems really engaged with whoever they're talking to—they're making direct eye contact the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty. They're also leaning in slightly, like their head's moving forward toward the person, and their chin is lifted up a bit, which makes them seem open and attentive, not closed off. I noticed their eyebrows are raised a few times, which sometimes happens when people are surprised or genuinely processing something, not necessarily when they're lying. And their lips are pulled up at the corners a little, which looks like a soft, maybe even warm expression—not a forced smile, but not a fake one either. There's no frowning, no avoiding eye contact, no nervous gestures like fiddling with their hands or looking away a lot. Those are all things I'd expect if someone was being deceptive, so the absence of those makes me lean toward them being truthful.

But I can see why it's not 100% clear. Raising eyebrows can also happen when someone's stressed or trying to think of a lie, and the chin movement might just be a natural way they talk, not a clue about truthfulness. The lip corners up could even be a slight smirk if they're amused by something, not necessarily sincerity. And honestly, people's baseline behavior varies—some folks just naturally have that open, engaged look even when they're being careful with their words. I've seen a lot of videos where someone looks calm and direct but is still hiding something, so I don't want to jump to conclusions. 

All things considered, though, the lack of classic "lying" cues and the consistent engagement (eye contact, leaning in, relaxed expression) makes it feel more likely they're telling the truth. But I'd still be cautious—without knowing the full context, it's hard to be sure. It just seems like they're not acting guarded or evasive, which is what I'd expect if they were lying. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but I'm not 100% certain. It's one of those cases where the behavior feels genuine, but you can never rule out the possibility they're just really good at hiding it.

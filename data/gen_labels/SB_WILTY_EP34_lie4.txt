Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying, but there are some things that make me lean toward it being deception. The person seems really tense in their body language—like their eyes are darting around a lot, and they're blinking way more than I'd expect normally. That frequent blinking, combined with them avoiding direct eye contact by looking sideways a lot, feels off. It's like they're trying not to engage fully with the person they're talking to, and the way their head keeps tilting and turning sideways while also moving back slightly—like they're physically creating distance—makes me think they're uncomfortable. The chin moving upward, almost like they're trying to hold themselves stiffly, adds to that sense of tension.  

But honestly, it's tricky because those signs alone don't prove lying. I've seen people blink a lot when they're just tired or in a bright room, and head tilting can be a natural gesture when someone's listening closely, not necessarily hiding something. Gaze shifting sideways might just be their normal way of thinking or a cultural thing—some people don't make direct eye contact without it meaning deception. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic "tells" like smiling nervously or covering their mouth, which sometimes happen when people are lying. They seem pretty neutral otherwise, so maybe it's just them being naturally awkward or stressed about the situation, not lying.  

I'd say the weight of it is leaning toward deception because of the combination—especially the blinking and the avoidance—but I wouldn't bet money on it. It feels like the kind of thing where if I had more context, like what they were saying or if they seemed inconsistent, I'd be more certain. Right now, it's just a gut feeling that the body language feels forced, but it could easily be something else. I'd hesitate to call it a lie without hearing the actual conversation.

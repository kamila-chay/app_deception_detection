Looking at the video, I'm really trying to figure this out because the expressions are kind of confusing at first glance. They're smiling while also scowling and frowning, which just feels contradictory—like they're trying to be friendly but genuinely upset about something. The frequent blinking and exaggerated eye closing stand out too; those often happen when someone's stressed or trying to hold back emotions, which could point to lying. But then again, the way they're looking at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor) and the head turning sideways feels natural, like they're just processing what they're saying, not avoiding it.  

On the flip side, if they're telling the truth, maybe they're frustrated *about* the situation they're describing—like they're upset about the topic itself, not the conversation. That would explain the scowl, frowning eyebrows, and lips pulled down. The smile might be a nervous reflex or an attempt to seem cooperative while they're actually struggling to explain something tough. The lips protruding and the gaze down/sideways could just be signs of thinking hard or being uncomfortable with the question, not deception.  

I keep circling back to that mix of smile and scowl though—it’s weirdly inconsistent for a calm, truthful moment. Liars sometimes do that when they're trying to mask their real feelings, but it’s also possible they're just having a genuine emotional conflict. The head side-turn and frequent blinking could go either way: stress signals or just habitual gestures. Honestly, without knowing the context of what they're talking about, it's really hard to say. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance (like gaze down *away* from the person), but here they're still making some eye contact. Still, the mixed signals make me lean slightly toward them not being fully comfortable, which *could* mean they're hiding something. But I’m not sure—maybe they're just a really expressive person dealing with a tough topic. I’d need more to go on, but based on this alone? I’d say it’s ambiguous, and I wouldn’t bet either way.

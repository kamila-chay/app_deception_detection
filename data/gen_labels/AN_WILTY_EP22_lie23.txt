Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't super obvious either way. What stands out to me is how steady they seem—like, they're looking directly at whoever they're talking to the whole time, which feels like they're being open. And they're nodding along while they speak, which usually makes me think someone's engaged and not hiding something. Their hands are open, palms up, which I've noticed before often signals someone trying to seem sincere, like they're not holding anything back. There's no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird facial expressions like scowling or over-the-top smiles. It all looks pretty calm and natural.

But then, I'm also thinking—maybe they're just really good at hiding it? I've heard people say some liars don't show the usual signs because they're practiced or just don't get nervous. Maybe they're rehearsed, or maybe they're just not the type to fidget. The fact that they're not doing anything "off" could actually be part of the deception, like they're deliberately keeping it smooth. I mean, if they were lying and trying to seem normal, they might *avoid* the nervous tells, right? So the lack of fidgeting might not mean they're honest—it could mean they're trying too hard to seem honest.

Also, I wonder about the context. If they're answering something simple or familiar, like "What's your name?" or "Did you see the meeting this morning?" then the calmness makes sense for truthfulness. But if it's a loaded question, like "Did you take the money?" then the calmness might feel *too* calm. The video doesn't show the question though, so I can't be sure. Without knowing what they're saying, it's hard to weigh the words against the body language.

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful because the cues I see—steady eye contact, nodding, open palms—align more with sincerity than deception. But I can't rule out that they're a very controlled liar. It's not 100% clear, and I'd want to hear the actual words or see more of the situation to be confident. Right now, it just feels like they're being straightforward, but I'd hesitate to say for sure they're not lying. It's one of those cases where the absence of "lie signs" is suggestive, but not proof. Maybe they're just not the type to get flustered.

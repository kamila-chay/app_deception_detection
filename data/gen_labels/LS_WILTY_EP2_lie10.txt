Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. They're sitting with their arms wide open—like they're not hiding anything—which usually feels like an honest gesture to me. They're also looking right at the camera a lot, which is the opposite of what I'd expect if they were lying (I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact). But here's where it gets confusing: they keep glancing down at their lap or the floor, and their head is tilted sideways a bit while they talk. I've read that looking down can sometimes signal discomfort or trying to remember a story, but I also know some people naturally look down when they're concentrating, especially if they're not used to being on camera. The sideways head tilt feels like they're listening carefully, not necessarily hiding something.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, maybe they're trying too hard to seem calm—like the open arms are a forced "I'm harmless" thing. But there's no fidgeting, no nervous touches, no fake smiles, which I'd expect if they were stressed about lying. The absence of those classic "lie cues" makes me lean toward them being genuine, but I'm not sure. Like, maybe they're just naturally reserved or distracted, not deceptive. I've seen people look down while telling the truth all the time—like when they're thinking of the right words. And the head turning sideways? Could be just how they talk, not a sign of deception.  

Honestly, it's tricky. The open arms and steady eye contact feel like strong "truth" signals, but the downcast gaze throws me off. I'd probably need to hear what they're saying or see more of their context to be confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet on it—there are too many ways that downcast look could be innocent. If I had to guess without more info, I'd say "probably not lying," but I'm still second-guessing because body language is so personal.

Watching the clip, I’m trying to determine if they’re being truthful, but I’m leaning toward the possibility that they might be lying. While their arms are open—usually a sign of honesty—and they do look at the camera often, which contradicts the common idea that liars avoid eye contact, there are other signals that raise some doubts. They frequently glance down at their lap or the floor, and their head is tilted sideways while speaking. Although looking down can indicate discomfort or an effort to remember a story, it can also be a sign of avoidance, which might suggest deception. The sideways head tilt could be interpreted as attentive listening, but it might also be a subtle sign of guardedness.

If they were lying, the open arm posture might be a deliberate attempt to appear open and harmless, almost forced. They don’t show classic signs of nervousness like fidgeting or fake smiles, yet the absence of those signs doesn't necessarily rule out lying; some people are just better at hiding nervousness. Given that the downcast gaze conflicts with the open posture and steady eye contact, it leaves me uncertain but somewhat suspicious. It’s hard to be sure since body language can be so individual, but taken together, these mixed signals make me lean toward deception, even if I wouldn’t say it definitively. Without more context or what they’re saying, I’d tentatively guess they might be lying, though I acknowledge that it’s not conclusive.

Hmm, this is tricky. I watched the clip, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or those nervous tells people often show when lying, like excessive blinking or frowning. They're actually making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? And their mouth is just... still, not doing anything weird like constantly moving or smiling unnaturally. The lips being slightly protruded? That’s a bit odd, but it could just be them thinking hard or a natural habit, not necessarily lying.  

But here’s where I hesitate: I’ve heard that some really good liars don’t show those classic cues at all. Maybe they’re practiced, or maybe they’re just really focused on what they’re saying, so they’re not fidgeting. The lack of "lying" behaviors doesn’t *prove* they’re telling the truth—it just means they’re not doing the things we usually associate with deception. And that lip thing... could that be a subtle sign of tension? Like, maybe they’re trying to hold back a reaction? I’m not sure.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, you’d expect them to maybe look away, shift in their seat, or seem distracted. But they’re not doing any of that. They’re just... present. So it leans toward truthful, but it’s not a slam dunk. Honestly, without more context—like what they’re saying or the situation—it’s hard to say for sure. I’d say it *feels* like they’re being genuine, but I’d hate to bet the farm on it. Maybe they’re just really good at staying calm under pressure. I’d say "likely truthful" based on what I saw, but I’d still be cautious.

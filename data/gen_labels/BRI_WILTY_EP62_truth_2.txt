Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video alone. So the person is talking, and honestly, they're not doing much that I'd immediately flag as "weird" for lying. Like, no fidgeting, no obvious nervous ticks—no hands rubbing, no forced smiles, not even blinking a lot. That's interesting because I think most people assume liars are all jittery, but maybe that's not always the case.  

What stands out is they keep looking up and sideways—not straight at the person they're talking to. At first, I wondered if that meant they're avoiding eye contact, which people often associate with lying. But then I remembered reading that when people are trying to recall a memory (like when they're being truthful), they often look up or away, not straight at you. So maybe they're just thinking hard about what they're saying, which could actually be a sign they're being honest.  

But then I second-guessed myself. Could they be *pretending* to think by looking up? Like, maybe they're rehearsing a lie and doing it in a way that *looks* natural? I mean, some people are really good at faking calmness. And the sideways glance—could that be a way to seem casual while they're making it up? It's hard to say.  

Also, they never look down or away in a way that seems shifty—just up and sideways, which feels more like someone mentally searching than hiding something. If they were lying, I'd expect more "tells," like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely, but they're not doing that. Still, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, right? Maybe they're just very composed.  

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful because the lack of nervous behavior matches what I've heard about genuine recall—people who remember things tend to look away to access their memory. But I'm not 100% sure. It could be they're just a really calm liar. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words to feel more confident. For now, it seems like they're probably telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to say for sure. It's one of those cases where the "no signs of lying" might actually be the sign of truth, but I can't rule out the possibility they're just good at hiding it.

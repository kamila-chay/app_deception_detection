Okay, so I just watched this clip, and I'm trying to figure out if this person is lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues don't really point to one thing clearly. Let me walk through what I noticed.

First off, they don't seem to be smiling or laughing, which is interesting because sometimes when people are being deceptive, they might try to force a smile to seem friendly. But here, they're not doing that—there's no fake smile or anything. Instead, their eyebrows are both frowning *and* raised at the same time? That’s kind of weird. Like, they look confused or maybe stressed, not necessarily deceptive. Frowning usually means negative emotion, but raised eyebrows can mean surprise or skepticism. It’s a bit conflicting, so I’m not sure what that means.

Their chin is moving up and down a lot—like little jerky motions. I’ve seen people do that when they’re nervous or trying to control their expression, but I’ve also seen it when people are just thinking hard or adjusting their posture. It’s not a classic "lie tell," but it’s unusual enough that it sticks out. And their head is turning sideways a few times while still looking at the person they’re talking to. Normally, if someone’s lying, they might avoid eye contact entirely, but here they’re still making some eye contact (gaze towards interlocutor) but then glancing sideways. That feels like a mix—maybe they’re trying to seem honest but are distracted or uncomfortable.

On the flip side, they’re not doing the usual stuff people think of when lying: no excessive blinking, no covering their mouth, no fidgeting with hands, no head shaking. They’re actually maintaining eye contact more than I’d expect if they were hiding something. The sideways glance could just be them thinking or being a bit distracted by the situation, not necessarily lying. Maybe they’re just really focused on what they’re saying, or maybe they’re stressed about the topic, not the truth of it.

I’m leaning a bit toward deception because of the chin movements and the sideways glances—those feel like subtle signs of internal conflict. But I’m really not sure. It could easily be that they’re just naturally expressive, or maybe they’re upset about what they’re talking about, not lying. Like, if they’re nervous about being asked a hard question, their body might react that way even if they’re telling the truth. The lack of obvious "lie" cues (like avoiding eyes or fidgeting) makes me hesitant to jump to conclusions.

Honestly, it’s a tough call. I wouldn’t say "definitely lying," but I also wouldn’t say "definitely truthful." It feels like they’re holding something back, but it’s not clear if it’s deception or just anxiety. I’d say it’s ambiguous—maybe 60-40 toward deception, but I’d want to see more context or hear the actual words they’re saying before I’d be confident. The chin thing really stands out to me as odd, but I’m not 100% sure if that’s a tell or just their habit. Gotta be careful not to overinterpret.

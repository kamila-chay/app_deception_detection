Watching this clip, I’m honestly a bit torn. On one hand, they’re maintaining eye contact with the person they’re speaking to—gaze toward interlocutor is true—which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But then they keep looking down a lot while doing it, which feels a little off. Like, if they were just relaxed and truthful, they’d probably look up or around naturally, not fixate downward while still meeting your eyes. That mix of "looking at you but not *at* you" makes me wonder if they’re trying too hard to seem sincere.  

Then there’s the head tilting—it’s a subtle thing, but it’s not the kind of casual tilt people do when they’re just listening. It feels a bit forced, like they’re mirroring someone else’s posture to seem engaged. And palms up? That’s usually a sign of openness, so that’s confusing. If they were lying, I’d expect them to avoid open palms or hide their hands, not show them like that. But maybe they’re *trying* to look trustworthy, which could be a red flag.  

On the flip side, they’re not doing any of the classic "liar tells"—no fidgeting, no exaggerated blinking, no fake smiles. They’re actually pretty still, which makes me think, *maybe they’re just calm*? Some people don’t show nervousness when lying because they’re practiced or because they’re not stressed about it. I’ve seen that before—people who seem unnervingly relaxed while deceiving.  

Honestly, the gaze thing is the strongest clue for me. Looking down while maintaining eye contact feels like a nervous habit they’re trying to mask, but it’s not *quite* the usual "look away when lying" pattern. It’s like they’re aware they’re being watched, so they’re overcompensating. But I’m not 100% sure. Maybe they’re just shy or thoughtful. I’d lean toward deception because of that gaze inconsistency, but I’d be hesitant to say for sure—there’s enough counter-evidence (like the palms up) that makes me second-guess. It’s one of those cases where the behavior doesn’t scream "lying," but it doesn’t feel quite natural either. If I had to guess, I’d say "maybe," but I’d want to see more context.

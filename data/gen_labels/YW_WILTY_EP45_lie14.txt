Watching this clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. On one hand, the head shaking stands out immediately—it's a clear "no" gesture, and it feels a bit too emphatic for a simple answer. They're also looking sideways a lot while still occasionally meeting the gaze, which often happens when someone's trying to avoid direct eye contact while they're fabricating something. And that scowl mixed with the lip corners up? It's weirdly inconsistent—like they're forcing a smile but still showing tension, which sometimes happens when people are trying to seem calm while lying. The raised eyebrows too, like they're skeptical of their own answer, which could signal internal conflict.  

But here's why I'm not totally sure: head shaking can be a nervous habit for some people, not necessarily deception. Maybe they're just frustrated with the question or the situation, not lying about it. The sideways glance could also mean they're thinking hard or feeling shy, not hiding something. And that lip corners up thing—while it's listed as "smile" being false, the corners are up—might just be a polite attempt to seem friendly, especially if they're trying to soften a difficult answer. Some people do that when they're uncomfortable, not when they're lying.  

Honestly, it's messy. The cues lean toward deception, but they're not definitive. If I had to guess based on what I see, I'd say *maybe* they're not being fully honest, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It could easily be just someone who's stressed or awkward in interviews. I'd want more context—like what they're talking about—to feel confident. But yeah, the head shake and the sideways look make me lean toward deception, even if it's not 100%.

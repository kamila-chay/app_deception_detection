Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn. On one hand, there's a few things that make me lean toward them not being entirely truthful. They keep looking directly at the person they're talking to—which usually feels like someone trying to seem honest—but then they also have this consistent sideways glance, like they're not fully engaging with the conversation. And that chin moving downward, almost like they're trying to pull it down or tuck it in a bit? That’s something I’ve noticed before in people who seem defensive or are holding something back, even if they’re trying to act calm. It’s subtle, but it sticks out a little when they’re not doing anything else nervous like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely.  

But then again, I’m also thinking maybe it’s just their natural way of talking. Some people glance sideways when they’re thinking or recalling something, and that chin movement could just be a habitual thing they do without even realizing it—like how I sometimes tilt my head when I’m listening. There’s no obvious signs of stress: no fake smiles, no rapid blinking, no hands covering their face or anything like that. If they were lying, I’d expect at least one of those classic "tells" to show up, but they’re all absent here. Maybe they’re just really good at staying calm, or maybe they’re actually telling the truth and I’m overthinking the sideways glance.  

Honestly, I wouldn’t bet money on it either way. The sideways gaze and chin thing *could* hint at deception, but it’s not strong enough to rule out the possibility that they’re just a naturally expressive person. I’d need more context—like what they’re actually saying or how the conversation is going—to feel confident. For now, I’d say it’s *possible* they’re being deceptive, but it’s also totally plausible they’re just being themselves. It’s one of those cases where the behavior isn’t screaming "liar," but it’s not screaming "truth" either. I’d lean toward "maybe," but I’d want to see it again or hear the content to be sure.

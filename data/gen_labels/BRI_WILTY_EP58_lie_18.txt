Based on the clip, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. The fact that they maintain direct eye contact while simultaneously casting frequent sideways glances suggests a kind of discomfort or hesitation that often accompanies deception. Additionally, the downward movement of their chin, almost as if trying to tuck it in, is something I’ve noticed in people who appear defensive or are subconsciously holding something back. While these cues are subtle and the person isn’t displaying more overt signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact altogether, the combination of these signals makes me suspicious.

It’s true that some people have habits like sideways glances or certain chin movements when thinking, so this could be natural behavior rather than deceit. Moreover, there are no obvious classic signs of lying such as fake smiles, rapid blinking, or shielding their face. However, the absence of those doesn’t necessarily mean they’re honest—they might just be good at masking their true feelings. Given the cues present, I’m inclined to think the person may be less than truthful, though I can’t say it with absolute certainty. Without more context or knowing what they’re saying, I’d cautiously lean toward the possibility that they are being deceptive.

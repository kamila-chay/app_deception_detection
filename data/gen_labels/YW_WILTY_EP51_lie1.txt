From what I can see in the clip, the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They’re making consistent eye contact with whoever they’re talking to—which is interesting because a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact, but I’ve heard that’s not always true. Sometimes they’ll even overcompensate and stare too much to seem honest. They’re also tilting their head a bit, which usually reads as curiosity or active listening—not something I’d immediately associate with deception. Like, when someone’s genuinely trying to understand you, they’ll tilt their head like that.  

But here’s where it gets tricky. I’m not sure if that head tilt is just natural for them or if it’s a sign they’re rehearsing something. Some people who lie really well don’t show any nervous ticks at all—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles (which matches the description here, since all those "deception cues" are marked as false). So the fact that they’re not doing any of those things *could* mean they’re being truthful, but it could also mean they’re just really good at hiding it. Like, if they’ve practiced this a lot, they might not give themselves away.  

I’d also wonder about the context. If they’re answering something super simple—like "Did you eat the last cookie?"—and they’re calm, that feels believable. But if it’s something high-stakes, like "Did you steal the report?" and they’re still relaxed, I’d be more suspicious. The video doesn’t give that background, though. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. The behavior *looks* like someone who’s either really comfortable or really practiced, but without knowing what they’re talking about, I can’t rule out lying entirely. I’d lean toward them being truthful based on the absence of red flags, but I’d still want to hear more of the conversation before I’d feel confident about it. It’s one of those cases where the lack of obvious lies doesn’t prove truth—just that they’re not making the classic mistakes.

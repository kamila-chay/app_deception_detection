From what I can see in the clip, the person appears calm and engaged, maintaining steady eye contact throughout. While many believe liars avoid eye contact, it’s also known that some may overcompensate by staring intently to appear honest. The slight head tilt suggests curiosity or active listening, which typically wouldn’t raise immediate suspicion. However, it’s hard to determine if that head tilt is a natural gesture or a subtle sign of rehearsed behavior.  

Interestingly, the absence of common deception indicators—like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or forced smiles—could be interpreted in two ways: either the person is genuinely truthful, or they are exceptionally skilled at masking any signs of lying. The lack of nervousness might actually lean toward the latter if this is a practiced performance.  

Without knowing the context of the conversation, it’s difficult to fully assess the situation. If the topic was trivial, such relaxed behavior might be convincing. But if the questions are more serious, their calm demeanor might hint that they’re deliberately controlling their reactions to avoid slipping up.  

Given these observations, I’m inclined to lean somewhat toward the possibility that the person might not be entirely truthful. While there’s no definitive proof, the behavior could align with someone who is carefully managing their appearance to deceive. It’s not certain, but the signs subtly suggest deception rather than genuine openness.

Hmm, based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really trying to figure this out. The person seems pretty tense at first glance—like they're frowning a bit with their eyebrows raised, and their lips are pulled down, which feels like they're genuinely uncomfortable or maybe stressed about whatever they're talking about. They're blinking a lot, which I've heard can happen when people are nervous, and they keep looking down instead of straight at the person they're talking to, which makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact. That *could* be a sign they're not being completely honest, especially since I've read that liars sometimes do that to not have to hold eye contact. 

But then there's the other stuff that's throwing me off. They're holding their palms up like they're showing their hands empty, and their arms are open wide—those are classic "I'm being truthful" gestures, right? Like, when people are being genuine, they often do that to seem less threatening. And they're not crossing their arms or covering their face, which I'd expect if they were hiding something. The head tilting sideways and the occasional sideways glance feels more like they're just thinking hard or trying to recall something, not necessarily trying to deceive. I mean, I've been in situations where I look down while trying to remember details, and that's not the same as lying. 

Also, the fact that they're making *some* eye contact (the "gaze towards interlocutor" is true) but then looking down sometimes—it doesn't feel like a consistent avoidance, which makes me doubt the "lying" angle. If they were lying, I'd expect more consistent shifting or fidgeting, but they're mostly still except for the blinking and the head movement. The frequent blinking could just be from being tired or the lighting in the room, not lying. Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure, but the open body language and the lack of classic "lie signs" (like covering their mouth or nervous hands) make me lean toward them being honest. Like, maybe they're just really uncomfortable with the question, not necessarily trying to hide anything. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're being truthful than lying. It's not a slam dunk, though—there are definitely elements that could be misread.

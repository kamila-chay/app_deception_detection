Looking at the video, the person is just sitting there with their gaze fixed downward—no eye contact, no shifting around, no fidgeting with their hands or face. They’re not smiling, not laughing, not even raising their eyebrows. It’s pretty quiet, like they’re just thinking or listening carefully. Honestly, it’s hard to tell if they’re lying just from that, because people often look down when they’re being truthful—like when they’re trying to recall something honestly or just being thoughtful. I’ve seen that before, especially in casual conversations where someone’s just being straightforward.  

But then again, avoiding eye contact *can* be a sign of lying, right? Like, some people do that when they’re nervous or hiding something. But here, they’re not doing *anything* else that’s weird—no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no tense shoulders. If they were lying, you’d expect more nervous energy, like fidgeting or glancing around. The fact that they’re so still, with just that steady downward gaze, actually feels more like someone who’s just… calm. Maybe they’re just shy or focused on what they’re saying, not trying to hide anything.  

I mean, it’s not a perfect clue. People lie in all sorts of ways—some are super composed. But given what I’m seeing, the lack of *any* other stress signals makes me lean toward them being truthful. Like, if they were lying, I’d expect at least a little something—maybe a quick glance away or a tight jaw. But here, it’s just quiet, steady focus. It feels genuine, but I’m not gonna say for sure. You never know with body language, especially in a short clip. Still, based on what’s *not* happening here, it seems more likely they’re telling the truth than not.

Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people act differently when they're nervous or just being themselves. What stands out to me is how often they're blinking—like, way more than usual. That's something I've heard can happen when someone's stressed or trying to hide something, so that makes me lean toward them not being completely honest. Their lips are also kind of pushed out, like they're holding tension there, and their chin moves up and down a lot while they're talking, which feels a bit unnatural, like they're trying to control their expression. They're also nodding and keeping eye contact, which sometimes people do when they're lying to seem convincing, but other times it just means they're focused.

But here's where I get stuck: frequent blinking can happen for totally innocent reasons—maybe the room is bright, or they're tired, or they just have dry eyes. That lip protrusion? It might just be their normal face when they're thinking, not necessarily a sign of lying. And the chin movements—could be a nervous habit, sure, but it might also just be how they talk. Plus, they're making eye contact and nodding consistently, which often feels more like someone trying to be cooperative than deceptive. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance of eye contact, but they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels a bit contradictory.

I guess I'm leaning toward deception just because of the blinking and the lip tension, but I'm not totally convinced. It could easily be them being anxious about the situation, not lying. Like, maybe they're just nervous about the interview or the topic, not hiding something. I'd need to see more context—like, what are they even talking about?—to feel more sure. Right now, it's a maybe. The signs point a little toward lying, but they're not strong enough to rule out normal nerves. I'd say it's possible, but I wouldn't bet on it without more to go on.

Looking at the clip, I'd say it's really hard to be sure, but I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful. The way they keep glancing down and sideways instead of meeting the camera or the person they're talking to feels off—like they're avoiding direct eye contact, which often happens when someone's not being straight with you. And that one raised eyebrow? It seemed kind of tense, like they were trying to seem casual but it came across as forced. No smiling or laughing either, which makes them seem more guarded than relaxed, and that usually sticks out when someone's trying to hide something.  

But honestly, I'm not totally convinced. I've seen people look down while they're just thinking hard or feeling awkward—maybe they're shy, or the question caught them off guard. That sideways glance could’ve been them checking their notes or the room, not necessarily hiding something. And the lack of nervous habits like fidgeting or touching their face actually makes me wonder if they're *too* composed, which could mean they're rehearsed or just really good at lying, but it could also mean they're genuinely calm. I mean, some people just don’t make eye contact naturally, and that eyebrow thing? Could’ve been surprise at the question, not guilt.  

So yeah, the behavior *suggests* possible deception, but it’s not a slam dunk. I’d say it’s a maybe—like, if I had to guess, I’d lean toward "lying" based on the gaze stuff, but I’d want to hear more context before I’d be confident. It’s one of those moments where the video alone doesn’t tell the whole story.

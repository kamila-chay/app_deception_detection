Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching the video, honestly. I'm not seeing any of the classic "liar tells" like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting—actually, the opposite, they're got their arms wide open and looking straight at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like openness. But wait, the gaze is actually *up* a bit, not directly at them, and I know some people say that upward gaze can be a sign of fabrication, like they're trying to remember a made-up story. That part makes me pause. 

On the other hand, they're not doing *anything* that screams "nervous liar"—no awkward pauses, no forced smiles, no lip-biting or hands covering their face. The open arms and steady posture feel more like someone who's confident or just naturally relaxed. I've seen people lie with a calm, even friendly demeanor before, so the lack of stress cues doesn't necessarily mean truth. But then again, if they *were* lying, I'd expect *some* sign of discomfort—like maybe a slight frown or a hesitant tone—but the video doesn't show that. 

It's really hard to say for sure. Maybe they're just a very composed person who doesn't show nervousness when lying, or maybe they're telling the truth and the upward gaze is just how they think. I'd lean toward *not* lying because the behavior feels more like genuine engagement than deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Like, if I had to guess right now, I'd say probably truthful, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying too—sometimes the content gives more clues than the body language alone. Yeah, it's just... ambiguous. I'd say it's more likely they're being honest, but I'm not at all certain.

This situation is quite complex, but leaning on the available cues, I find myself inclined to suspect some level of deception. While the person maintains open arms and direct posture, which typically suggest openness, their gaze is directed upward rather than straight at the other person. Since an upward gaze can sometimes indicate that someone is fabricating a story or trying to recall something invented, that raises a red flag. 

Moreover, although there are no overt signs of nervousness like fidgeting or awkward pauses, the absence of such signs doesn't necessarily guarantee honesty. People can present themselves calmly and confidently while still being untruthful. Interestingly, I might expect even subtle indicators of discomfort when someone lies—such as a hesitant tone or slight facial expressions—but none are evident here. This absence could mean the person is practiced at hiding such signs or simply very composed under pressure.

Overall, while the behavior does show engagement and confidence, the upward gaze combined with the lack of any clear truthful signals makes me lean towards the possibility that the person might be lying. It's not definitive, but I would cautiously suggest they are probably not being entirely truthful.

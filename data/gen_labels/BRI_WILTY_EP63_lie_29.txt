Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. The person is speaking while keeping their gaze down the whole time—like they're looking at their hands or the floor instead of making eye contact. That makes me pause because I've heard people say avoiding eye contact can be a sign of lying, but I also know it's super common for people to look down when they're just thinking, feeling shy, or even being very careful about what they're saying. Like, maybe they're nervous about the topic, not necessarily hiding something.  

Then there's the palms up thing—they have their hands open, facing upward, like they're trying to seem open or honest. I've seen that in some videos where people do that when they want to appear sincere, but honestly, I'm not sure if it's a reliable clue. Sometimes people do it naturally without thinking, or maybe they're just gesturing while they talk. It doesn't scream "lying" to me, but it also doesn't scream "truthful" either.  

What's weird is they're not doing any of the classic "deception tells" I've heard about—no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no over-the-top gestures. They're actually pretty still, which might suggest they're calm and collected, but then again, someone who's practiced at lying might also stay very still. The absence of nervous habits makes me wonder if they're actually comfortable with what they're saying, but I can't rule out that they're just good at hiding it.  

I guess I'm torn because the down gaze *feels* like it could be suspicious, but it's so ambiguous. Like, if I were in a conversation with them, I'd probably ask for more context or check if they've been acting this way before. Without knowing what they're talking about or their usual behavior, it's really hard to say. Maybe they're just a quiet person, or maybe they're being evasive—I don't think I can call it one way or the other based on just this clip. It feels like it could go either way, and I'd need more to be sure.

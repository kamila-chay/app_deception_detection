Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. I'm trying to gauge if they're being honest, but honestly, it's not always clear-cut. What I noticed first is that they kept making eye contact with whoever they were talking to—like, they were actually looking at the person they were speaking to, not avoiding it or looking away a lot. That's interesting because sometimes people who are lying *do* avoid eye contact, but not always. So that actually makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, since they seemed engaged.

Then there were these little head movements—like tilting their head a bit, and nodding along while they spoke. Head tilting usually feels like someone is listening or thinking, not necessarily hiding something. And they nodded a few times, which feels natural, like they were agreeing with themselves or processing what they were saying. But I know some people nod nervously when they're lying, so I can't rule that out entirely. 

The blinking was a bit frequent, though. That's the part that makes me second-guess. I've heard that people blink more when they're stressed or lying, so that *could* be a red flag. But I also know blinking can just be from dry eyes, or maybe they're just a naturally expressive person. I wouldn't want to jump to conclusions on that alone. 

Oh, and the chin thing—like, their chin moved up and down a few times while they were talking. It wasn't dramatic, but it felt like they were thinking through what they were saying, not just spitting out a rehearsed line. That kind of subtle movement often happens when someone's recalling something real, not fabricating it. But again, it's not definitive. Some people just have little habits like that when they talk.

The other thing that stood out is they didn't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding touch—no hands on face, no crossing arms, nothing like that. If they were lying, I might expect more nervous energy, but they seemed pretty calm overall. The gaze shifting sideways a couple times could just mean they were gathering their thoughts, which happens to everyone when they're speaking, not just liars. 

Honestly, though, I'm not 100% sure. It's really hard to tell from just a few cues. The absence of classic "lie" signals (like avoiding eye contact or obvious fidgeting) makes me think they might be telling the truth, but I can't say for certain. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm under pressure. I'd want to see more of the context—like, what were they even talking about?—before I'd feel confident either way. Right now, it just feels... neutral. Like they're just a person speaking naturally, and I don't see anything that screams "they're lying." But I also wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's probably truth, but I'm not going to claim I know for sure.

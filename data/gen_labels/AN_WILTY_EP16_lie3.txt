Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tricky because people act differently in different situations, and it's easy to misread body language. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous blinking. In fact, they're looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which usually feels like they're engaged, not hiding something. Their palms are up, which often reads as open and honest in conversations, and they're tilting their head a bit while listening—like they're really trying to understand what's being said. That head tilt, combined with those raised eyebrows, makes me think they might be genuinely surprised or processing something, not necessarily lying.  

But here's where it gets confusing. Raised eyebrows can sometimes signal deception too, especially if someone's trying to seem innocent or "oh wow, I didn't expect that" when they're actually hiding something. And the head tilt... well, some people do that when they're being deceptive, like they're putting on a "thoughtful" front. I’ve seen that in other videos where people are lying but trying to seem sincere. So it’s not impossible they’re not being truthful.  

What really throws me is how *not* nervous they seem. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs—like fidgeting with their hands, avoiding eye contact, or even a forced smile. But they’re just sitting there, calm, with that slight head tilt and raised brows. It feels more like they’re just thinking hard about the question or genuinely reacting to something unexpected. Like maybe they’re trying to recall a detail, not fabricate one.  

Still, I can’t rule out deception entirely. Maybe they’re a really good liar who doesn’t show the usual tells, or maybe the context of the conversation matters a lot—like if they’re in a high-pressure situation where they’d naturally be more expressive. Without knowing what they’re being asked, it’s hard to say.  

Honestly, after watching it a few times, I’d lean toward them telling the truth. The absence of classic "lying" cues (like nervousness or avoidance) feels stronger than the ambiguous ones (like the head tilt). But I’m not 100% sure—I’d want to see more of the conversation or know the situation better. It’s not a clear-cut case, and that’s why I’d hesitate to call it deception without more context.

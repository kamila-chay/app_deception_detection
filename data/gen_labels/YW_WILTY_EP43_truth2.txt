Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's tricky because body language isn't always a perfect tell. What stands out to me is how they're interacting with the person they're talking to—there's consistent eye contact (they're looking at the other person most of the time, not avoiding it), and they're nodding along, which usually feels like active listening. That makes me lean toward them being genuine, because liars sometimes avoid eye contact or don't engage as much. They also have this subtle upturn at the corners of their mouth—not a big smile, but like a quiet, maybe even polite, acknowledgment. It doesn't feel forced or exaggerated, which sometimes happens when people are trying too hard to seem friendly while lying.

But then I keep thinking about the sideways glances they make occasionally—like when they're looking off to the side while talking. I've heard some people say that's a sign of deception, like they're gathering their thoughts or making something up. And their gaze sometimes drops down too, which could be nervousness, but it could also just be them thinking deeply about what they're saying. I know people often say liars look away, but I've also seen people who are telling the truth look down when they're being careful or thoughtful. The head turning sideways feels a bit like they're processing, not necessarily hiding something. 

What's really making me hesitate is that they don't have any of the classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, covering their mouth, or excessive blinking. That's not a guarantee of truth, but it's not a red flag either. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more nervous gestures or a bigger fake smile, but this feels... calm? Like they're just speaking naturally. Still, I can't rule out that they're a really good liar who's keeping it together. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying. 

All things considered, the eye contact, nodding, and that subtle, relaxed lip movement make me think they're probably telling the truth. But I'd hesitate to say "definitely" because body language is so subjective. It just feels more like someone who's engaged and honest than someone trying to hide something. I'd lean toward truthful, but yeah, I'm not 100% certain—there's always room for doubt.

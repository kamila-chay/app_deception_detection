Hmm, this is a tough one to call just from watching. At first glance, they seem pretty steady—like they're actually looking at the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually makes me think they're being straightforward. I've seen a lot of people avoid eye contact when they're lying, so that direct gaze feels like it might lean toward truthfulness. But then they keep glancing sideways a little, and I wonder if that's a sign they're trying to think of what to say next or maybe even fabricate something. I've heard that sideways glances can sometimes indicate deception, but honestly, I've also seen people do that when they're just processing thoughts, not lying.  

Then there's the chin thing—like it's dipping down a tiny bit, almost like they're tensing up or hesitating. That could be nervousness from being on camera, or it might be a subtle sign they're uncomfortable with the question. But here's the thing: they're not fidgeting, not smiling awkwardly, not avoiding the gaze entirely, and there's no obvious "tell" like covering their mouth or crossing arms. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic signs, but they're mostly calm in those ways. Still, I know some people are really good at hiding deception, so maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure.  

On the flip side, the sideways glances and that chin movement could still add up to something off, especially if they're rehearsed or stressed. But without more context—like what they're talking about or how they usually act—it's hard to say. I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because the direct eye contact feels more consistent with honesty than deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Honestly, it's one of those cases where the behavior is so neutral that it could go either way, and I'd need more to feel confident. Maybe they're just a little tired or distracted, not lying. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% sure—these things are way messier than TV makes them look.

This is a tricky one, but leaning slightly toward the idea that they might be lying seems reasonable. While they maintain fairly steady eye contact, which could suggest honesty, the repeated sideways glances feel a bit off—these can sometimes indicate someone is fabricating or unsure of their story. The slight downward dip of the chin also hints at possible discomfort or hesitation, which might align with withholding the truth. They don’t show obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, but some people are skilled at masking their deception, so calming behaviors aren't definitive proof of honesty. Considering these subtle but mixed cues, it seems more likely than not that they could be concealing something, though without more context, it's difficult to be certain. Overall, I lean toward the possibility that they’re not being entirely truthful, but it’s still a cautious judgment.

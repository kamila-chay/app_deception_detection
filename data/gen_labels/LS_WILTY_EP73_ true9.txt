Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain. The thing that stands out most is how they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is definitely on. When people are lying, they often avoid eye contact or look away a lot, so that feels like a good sign. They also have these raised eyebrows and are blinking a bit more than usual, which I guess *could* be nervousness, but it doesn't seem like the classic "lying" nervous ticks. Like, no frowning, no lip biting, no shifting around—just calm eye contact with a little eyebrow lift, which honestly looks more like they're processing something or maybe a bit surprised, not like they're hiding something.  

But yeah, I can see why someone might question it. Frequent blinking *can* be a sign of stress, and if they're lying, they might be trying too hard to seem relaxed, so the blinking might actually be a red flag. And the raised eyebrows... sometimes people do that when they're being deceptive, like trying to seem innocent. But honestly, the eye contact feels too consistent for that. If they were lying, I'd expect them to glance away more, or maybe fidget with their hands, but they're just sitting there, looking straight at the other person, blinking a bit but otherwise still. It just doesn't *feel* like the usual behavior I'd associate with someone being untruthful.  

I'm not gonna say "definitely truth," because you can never be 100% sure from video alone—maybe they're just really good at hiding it. But based on what I'm seeing, it seems way more likely they're being honest than not. The lack of other nervous tells, combined with that steady eye contact, tips it for me. It just looks like someone who's focused and trying to be clear, not someone scrambling to cover up a lie.

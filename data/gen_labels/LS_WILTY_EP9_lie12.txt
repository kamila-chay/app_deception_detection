Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying—I think it's pretty ambiguous, honestly. The person seems pretty tense in a way that makes me wonder, but I also know people can act that way for reasons that have nothing to do with lying. For instance, they're raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking frequently, which often shows nervousness. And that exaggerated mouth opening when they're talking? It feels a bit forced, like they're trying too hard to sound convincing. Their lip corners are pulled down, which usually looks like they're upset or frustrated, not necessarily deceptive, but it adds to that "something's off" vibe. Plus, their chin keeps dipping down like they're trying to hide or shrink away, and the head moving backward while tilting—those little shifts can sometimes signal defensiveness or discomfort. Nodding and keeping eye contact seems like they're trying to seem engaged, which might be a sign they're rehearsing or being careful.

But here's why I'm hesitant: all of those things could just be them being naturally anxious or tired. I've seen people blink like crazy when they're in a bright room or just stressed about a normal conversation. The raised eyebrows might just be surprise at what they're saying, not guilt. And the fact they're looking directly at the person they're talking to? That usually leans toward truthfulness, not deception—I mean, liars often avoid eye contact, so this feels counter to what I'd expect. The lip corners down could also just be a neutral expression, like they're concentrating hard on what they're saying. And head tilting? That's super common in regular conversations, not just when lying. Honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to tell if the tension is from the topic being heavy or from them trying to hide something. I'd probably need more context—like, is this a high-stakes interview, or just a casual chat?—to feel more confident. Right now, it's a maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it either way. It feels like they're putting in extra effort, but effort doesn't always mean deception.

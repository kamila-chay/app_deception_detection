Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. I saw the person in the clip, and they definitely had their eyebrows raised a couple of times—like they were surprised or maybe skeptical about something. And their eyes kept glancing sideways a bit, not straight at whoever they were talking to. At first, I wondered if that sideways look meant they were avoiding the question, which sometimes people do when they're not being honest. Raised eyebrows can also feel like they're signaling something, like "wait, is this true?" or "I'm not sure about this."

But then I kept watching, and... honestly, they didn't seem super nervous. No fidgeting with their hands, no tight lips, no awkward pauses where they were stammering. They didn't smile much either, but they also didn't look angry or scowl like someone might if they were trying to hide something. The sideways glance felt more like they were just thinking about what to say next, or maybe they were slightly distracted by something off-camera—not necessarily lying. Sometimes people look away when they're concentrating on remembering details, not when they're making stuff up.

I guess the counterargument is strong though: if they *were* lying, you'd expect more obvious signs like avoiding eye contact entirely or fidgeting. But since they didn't do those things, it makes me lean toward them being truthful. Though, I know body language isn't foolproof—some people are really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just naturally a bit stiff. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The sideways glance *could* be a sign of discomfort, but without more context or other cues, I'd probably hesitate to call it a lie. I'd say it's more likely they're just being thoughtful, not deceptive. But yeah, it's a close call—I wouldn't bet money on it either way.

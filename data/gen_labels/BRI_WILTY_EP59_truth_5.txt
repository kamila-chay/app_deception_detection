Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching them closely, and they're definitely not smiling or laughing, which makes me think they're taking the situation seriously. Their eyebrows are raised a bit while they're frowning slightly—like they're genuinely confused or processing something, not putting on a show. And they're mostly looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to connect, but then they glance sideways a couple of times. That sideways look makes me pause for a second—sometimes people do that when they're nervous, which could be a sign of lying. But then again, I've seen people glance sideways when they're just thinking hard, especially if the topic is awkward or they're trying to recall details. 

The thing that leans me toward truth is how steady their gaze is most of the time—they're not darting around or avoiding eye contact completely, which often happens when someone's hiding something. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or those classic "nervous tells" like touching their face or rubbing their hands, but they're just sitting there, still. The frowning and raised eyebrows feel more like genuine concentration than deception—they're not *acting* upset, just... thinking. 

But I can see why someone might doubt it. That sideways glance *does* stick out, and if the topic was something sensitive, it could hint at discomfort. Still, the lack of other signs—no fake smiles, no exaggerated movements, no shifting away—makes me think the sideways look might just be a habit or a momentary distraction. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It feels like they're just being earnest, even if they're a little tense. It's not *definitive*, but it doesn't scream "lying" either. Like, if I had to guess without any other context, I'd say they're probably being honest.

Honestly, while it's not entirely certain, I lean toward thinking the person might be lying. The repeated head shaking combined with a smile feels off—as if they're saying "no" nonverbally while trying to appear friendly, which can be a sign of someone forcing a reaction to mask the truth. Their raised and furrowed eyebrows suggest they're struggling to maintain composure, and the rubbing of hands and touching their head point to nervousness, which often accompanies deception.

On the other hand, their open arms and steady eye contact seem a bit unusual for someone who's lying, since those behaviors typically convey openness and honesty. However, I know that some people who lie intentionally maintain eye contact and open body language to appear credible, so that doesn’t entirely rule out deception. The mixed expression—a smile mingled with a scowl—adds to the complexity, possibly indicating discomfort or conflicted feelings that might or might not be linked to lying.

Given the prominent head shaking alongside the nervous gestures, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they could be deceptive, though it’s not definitive. The eye contact and open posture leave room for doubt, making it hard to be sure without more context. Overall, I suspect there’s a good chance they might be lying, but I wouldn’t say it with complete confidence.

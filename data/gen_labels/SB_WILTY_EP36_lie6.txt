Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll walk through what I'm noticing. The person seems to be shaking their head a lot while also smiling—like they're saying "no" but trying to look friendly at the same time. That feels a bit off, kind of like they're forcing a smile while disagreeing, which I've heard can happen when someone's trying to cover up the truth. Their eyebrows are raised and furrowed at the same time too, which looks like they're really trying to hold it together while they're speaking. And they're rubbing their hands together and touching their head a few times—those are classic signs of nervousness, right? Like they're stressed about what they're saying.

But here's where I get stuck: they're also keeping their arms open, not crossed, and they're looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be avoiding eye contact or folding their arms to create distance, but this feels the opposite—like they're trying to seem open and honest. I've seen people do that when they're nervous about being caught, but it could also just mean they're really trying to convince someone. And the smile... it's there, but it's mixed with a scowl, which is weird. Maybe they're genuinely conflicted about what they're saying instead of lying? Like, they might be uncomfortable with the question but not necessarily deceptive.

The head shaking is the strongest clue for me—it's such a clear "no" gesture, but they're not saying "no" out loud. That makes me lean toward deception, but I keep second-guessing because of the eye contact and open arms. Sometimes people who are lying *do* make eye contact to seem credible, so it's not a sure thing. Honestly, it's a toss-up. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe deception because of the head shaking and fidgeting, but I'd feel way more confident if they'd been avoiding eye contact or had more obvious signs like fidgeting with their hands a lot more. As it stands, it's confusing—could be stress from the situation, not lying. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

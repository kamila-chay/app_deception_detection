Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call. The person in the video is definitely looking right at the camera the whole time—no shifting eyes, no glancing away, which usually makes me think they're being honest, you know? Like, when people are telling the truth, they often keep eye contact because they're not hiding anything. But then again, I've heard that some really practiced liars will stare *too* hard to seem trustworthy, so that alone might not mean much.  

What’s weird is how still they are. No fidgeting, no blinking, no little head movements—just this steady, calm gaze. Honestly, that feels a bit off to me. If they were really relaxed and telling the truth, I’d expect them to have some natural little gestures, like a slight shrug or a relaxed hand movement. But here, it’s like they’re frozen. It makes me wonder if they’re trying *too* hard to seem composed, which could actually be a sign they’re rehearsing or hiding something.  

On the flip side, though, if they *were* lying, I’d expect to see more signs—like nervous blinking or avoiding the gaze. The fact that they’re not doing any of that makes me second-guess. Maybe they’re just a naturally calm person? Or maybe they’ve been coached to stay still? I mean, it’s possible they’re telling the truth and just happen to be really good at staying still. But the lack of *any* micro-expressions or small movements—like even a tiny smile or frown—feels... unnatural. Like, humans don’t stay that perfectly still when they’re talking, unless they’re suppressing something.  

Honestly, I’m torn. Part of me says, "They’re looking you dead in the eye, so they must be truthful," but another part whispers, "Wait, why are they *so* still?" It’s hard to pin down. If I had to guess, I’d lean toward deception because the absence of nervousness feels like a red flag in this context—like they’re putting on a performance. But I’m not at all confident. It could just be that they’re genuinely relaxed, and I’m overthinking it. I’d need to see more of the conversation to be sure, but based on this clip alone? I’m not sure. It’s one of those cases where the silence feels louder than the words.

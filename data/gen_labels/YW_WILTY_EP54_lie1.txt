Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning slightly toward them not being entirely truthful. The thing that sticks out most is how their head keeps moving backward—like they're pulling away a little when they're speaking, especially when they're answering questions. That's a bit unusual; most people lean in when they're engaged or trying to be convincing, so pulling back feels defensive, almost like they're creating physical distance from what they're saying. And their eyebrows are raised a few times, not in surprise but kind of tense, like they're trying to seem relaxed while actually being on edge. 

But here's why I'm not totally convinced: they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually signals honesty—people who lie often avoid eye contact or look away. Also, their palms are up, which feels open and neutral, not like a classic "nervous" gesture (like fidgeting or covering their mouth). I've seen people do that when they're trying to seem sincere, not deceptive. And their voice doesn't sound rushed or shaky, which sometimes happens when someone's lying. 

Then there's the counter: maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or they're genuinely thinking hard about the question. The head movement backward could just be them adjusting their posture while concentrating, not necessarily lying. I've known people who do that when they're being thoughtful, not dishonest. Plus, without knowing what they're being asked about, it's hard to tell if their reaction makes sense for the topic—like, if they're answering something sensitive, even truth-tellers might pull back a bit. 

So yeah, I'd say it's a maybe. The head movement and tense eyebrows give me a small nudge toward deception, but the eye contact and open palms feel more honest. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward deception just because the head movement is so consistent, but I'd want to see more context—like the actual question they're answering or their normal behavior—to be sure. It's not clear-cut, though. They could just be a little awkward, not lying.

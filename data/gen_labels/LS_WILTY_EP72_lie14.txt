After watching the clip a couple of times, I’m still trying to figure this out. The person’s face is really still—no smiling, no laughing, not even frowning. The thing that stands out to me is how tight their lips are pulled back, like they’re holding them in a neutral line but with this slight tension. It’s not a full frown, just the lips retracted, which feels... off for a normal conversation. I’ve seen people do that when they’re trying not to smile about something they shouldn’t, or maybe when they’re nervous about what they’re saying. Like, they’re forcing themselves to look calm but it’s a bit too controlled.  

But here’s where I get stuck: I’ve also seen people do that when they’re just concentrating really hard on answering a question, like they’re thinking through the words carefully. Maybe they’re not lying—they’re just being extra careful with their response. And honestly, the rest of their behavior doesn’t scream "liar": no darting eyes, no awkward pauses, no nervous gestures. They’re sitting pretty still, which sometimes happens when people are telling the truth and just being earnest.  

I keep circling back to the lips though. If they were relaxed, their mouth would probably be more natural, not pulled back like that. But then again, some people just have a habit of keeping their lips tight when they talk, and it’s not always about lying. It could be a nervous tic, or maybe they just have dry lips. I’m not sure if it’s enough to call it a lie. It feels like a maybe—leaning toward "not entirely truthful" because the tension feels forced, but I’d hesitate to say for sure. It’s one of those things where you *think* you see a sign, but then you second-guess if it’s just them being them. I’d say it’s suspicious, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.

I'm watching this clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky because there's not much to go on. The person is just looking down the whole time—no eye contact with whoever they're talking to, no fidgeting, no obvious signs of nervousness like blinking a lot or shifting around. At first glance, I might wonder if looking down means they're hiding something, like some people think liars avoid eye contact. But I've read enough about this that I'm not sure that's reliable. Truth-tellers look down all the time—they might be thinking, feeling embarrassed, or just not used to being on camera. 

What really stands out to me is how calm they seem. If they were lying, I'd expect to see *something* else—like tense hands, a forced smile, or maybe avoiding the question with awkward pauses. But here, they're just... quiet and still, with their gaze down. No exaggerated movements, no lip biting, nothing. It feels more like they're just focused on what they're saying, maybe even a bit humble. 

But wait—could that downward gaze *actually* be a sign? I guess I'm second-guessing myself because I've heard so many myths about liars looking away. Maybe they're avoiding eye contact because they're uncomfortable with the question, not because they're lying. But honestly, the lack of other "red flags" makes me lean away from that. If they were trying to hide something, they'd probably act more nervous, right? Like, people who lie often overcompensate—smiling too much, talking too fast. Here, it's the opposite: very low-key, no extra energy. 

I guess I'm thinking the truth is more likely here. The downward gaze alone doesn't scream "lie," and without other signs, it feels like they're just being natural. But I'm not *sure*—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying or see the context. Like, if they were denying something they clearly did, even looking down might not mean much. But based *just* on the video, I'd say it seems like they're telling the truth. It just doesn't feel like the "telling a lie" energy I've seen before. Still, I'd hesitate to say 100%—it's just what *I* notice, and I'm not a lie detector.

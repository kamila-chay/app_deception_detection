Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll walk through what I'm noticing as I watch. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really trying to hold that gaze—while also occasionally glancing sideways, which feels a bit off. Their eyebrows are raised pretty noticeably, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, and they keep tilting their head and turning it slightly to the side, which usually feels like someone trying to seem engaged or maybe even a bit defensive.  

At first, I thought, "Hmm, they're looking right at the person, so they must be telling the truth," because I've heard so much about liars avoiding eye contact. But then I remembered that's not always true—some people actually overcompensate and stare too hard when they're lying. The raised eyebrows and head movements make me wonder if they're nervous under the surface, even if they're trying to seem calm. They don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding their gaze entirely, which *could* point to truthfulness, but the sideways glances and head tilting feel like they're not fully relaxed.  

On the flip side, though, those behaviors could just be their natural way of talking—maybe they're an expressive person who always tilts their head or raises their brows when thinking. The sideways gaze might even be them looking at a note or something off-camera, not necessarily deception. And honestly, the lack of other classic "liar tells" (like blinking a lot or covering their mouth) makes me second-guess. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, but they seem pretty composed otherwise.  

I guess it's tricky because deception is so subtle. It could be that the raised eyebrows are just genuine surprise about the topic, or the head tilting is just them listening intently. But the way they combine direct eye contact with those little shifts in gaze and posture... it feels like they're performing a little too carefully. I'm leaning toward deception, but I'm not at all certain—without more context, like what they're even saying, it's really hard to tell. I'd probably say "maybe," but I'd hesitate to call it a sure thing.

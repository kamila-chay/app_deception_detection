Looking at the clip, I'm not totally sure, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person's doing a few things that make me pause—like they're raising their eyebrows a bit and tilting their head while looking straight at the person they're talking to, and their gaze is up, not down or away. I've heard that when people look up while talking, it can sometimes mean they're trying to remember something, which might be honest if they're just thinking. But I also know that some people who lie will look up to seem thoughtful, like they're crafting a story. The eyebrow-raising feels a bit odd too—it's not a full smile or a scowl, just that little lift, which could be surprise or maybe just nervousness. 

On the flip side, they're not avoiding eye contact at all, which I'd usually expect if they were hiding something. Most of the time, liars glance away or fidget, but here they're holding steady eye contact while tilting their head like they're really listening. That actually makes me lean a little toward them being genuine, because if they were making it up, I'd think they'd be more careful about how they're looking at the other person. But then again, some people who lie get really good at faking engagement, so the head tilt and gaze could just be part of that. 

The thing that's throwing me off is the lack of other "tells"—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of stress like frequent blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those physical cues, but it's all pretty calm. Still, I know not all liars show obvious signs, and some people just naturally tilt their heads or raise their brows. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. It feels like they might be telling the truth because they seem relaxed and engaged, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at hiding it. I'd probably need to hear more of what they're saying to feel confident either way. For now, I'm leaning toward truth, but I'm not betting the farm on it.

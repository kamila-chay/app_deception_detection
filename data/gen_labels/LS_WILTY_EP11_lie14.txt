Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're being truthful or not. What stands out most is how much their chin is moving—up and down like they're trying to push something away, almost like they're physically resisting the words coming out. And their eyebrows are knotted in a frown the whole time, which feels off for a normal conversation. They're also tilting their head a lot while nodding it forward and back, which seems a bit unnatural—like they're overcompensating for something. Their eyes keep darting down, not meeting the other person's gaze much, which often happens when someone's not being straight with you.

But here's why I'm not totally convinced: maybe they're just really stressed or tired. I've seen people frown and shift their chin when they're genuinely trying to remember something important, not necessarily lying. The head tilting could just be them thinking hard, and the downward gaze might mean they're concentrating, not avoiding. Some folks naturally move their heads like that when they're nervous about a question, even if they're being honest. It's also possible they're just uncomfortable in the situation—like maybe they're answering a tough question about their job or something personal, and the stress is showing physically.

Still, the combination of the frown, the chin motion, and the head movements together feels a bit too much for just "being tired." Truthful people usually have more relaxed body language when they're not hiding anything—they don't lock their eyebrows like that or keep their chin in constant motion. It's not 100% clear, but it leans toward deception for me. Like, if they were telling the truth, I'd expect their face to be more neutral, or their head to be still while they answer. The way they're physically fighting the moment makes me think they're not saying what they actually feel. But honestly, I'm not sure—it could just be their natural way of talking. I'd want to see more of the context to be sure.

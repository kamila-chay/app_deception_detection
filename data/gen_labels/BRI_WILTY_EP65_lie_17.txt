Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll try to break it down as I'd think through it while watching. The person seems pretty still overall—no obvious fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, and they're not smiling or laughing like they're trying to be overly friendly. What stands out is how they keep raising their eyebrows a bit and opening their eyes really wide, like they're trying to look extra attentive or maybe even surprised. That exaggerated eye opening feels a bit unnatural to me, like they're forcing it to seem sincere, which sometimes happens when people are nervous about lying. But then again, I've seen people do that when they're genuinely excited or trying to emphasize something, like when they're sharing good news or reacting to something unexpected. 

On the other hand, the lack of other classic "lie signs" makes me hesitate. If they were really lying, I'd expect more signs—like fidgeting with their hands, avoiding looking at the camera, or maybe even a forced smile. But here, they're mostly just sitting there with that raised-brow, wide-eyed look, which doesn't scream "deception" to me. It could just be them being really engaged in the conversation, or maybe they're just a naturally expressive person. Honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to say. If they were describing something mundane, like their grocery list, that exaggerated eye thing might just be weird but harmless. But if they're denying something big, like "I didn't do it," then it might lean toward deception. 

I guess I'm leaning a little toward "maybe lying" because the eye thing feels a bit overdone for a normal conversation, but I'm not confident at all. It could easily be a red herring—like they're just tired or had coffee and their eyes are wide open naturally. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel sure. For now, it's one of those cases where the behavior is weird enough to make you pause, but not weird enough to confirm it's a lie. I'd say it's ambiguous, but if I had to guess, it's closer to deception than truth, just because of how exaggerated that eye movement is. Still, I'd be totally open to being wrong.

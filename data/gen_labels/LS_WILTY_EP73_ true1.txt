Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but the behavior they're showing seems pretty consistent with someone telling the truth. They're making steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—looking right at them the whole time—and their head is tilted slightly while they're also turning it a bit sideways, like they're really listening or thinking about what they're saying. That kind of calm, engaged head movement doesn't usually come across as nervous or forced. And they're not doing anything like fidgeting, blinking a lot, or covering their mouth, which are things I've noticed people often do when they're trying to hide something. 

That said, I guess you could argue that maybe they're just really good at faking it. Some people who lie practice keeping their composure, so the lack of obvious tells might not mean much—it could just mean they're experienced at lying. Also, the way they're looking up occasionally might not be a strong indicator; sometimes people look up when they're recalling a memory, but it could also be a habit for them regardless of whether they're being honest. I've seen people who seem super calm while lying, so it's not impossible. 

But honestly, the way they're sitting with their head tilted and maintaining eye contact feels more like someone who's genuinely engaged in the conversation, not someone trying to pull something off. The absence of those classic "nervous" cues—like avoiding eye contact or shifting around—makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just seems like the most natural behavior I'm seeing here. If they were lying, I'd expect to see more of those little tells, but I don't. So yeah, my gut says truth, but I'm not 100% certain. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're talking about.

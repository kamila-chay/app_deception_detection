Watching the clip, my first thought is that this person seems a bit off-kilter, but I'm really not sure if it's because they're lying or just genuinely uncomfortable. They keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really high, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem more engaged. And their mouth opens way wider than normal when they're speaking, which feels a bit forced, like they're overcompensating. Their eyes dart down a lot instead of meeting the camera, and they're tilting their head a bit while nodding, which makes me think they're trying to seem agreeable but maybe not fully present. The arms being open is weirdly consistent though—they're not crossed or closed off, which usually signals honesty, so that's confusing.  

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just naturally expressive. Some people raise their eyebrows a lot when they're listening carefully, or maybe they're just tired or stressed about the situation, not lying. The head tilt and nod could easily be normal listening behavior—like when someone's processing what they're hearing. And the mouth opening? Could be a habit, or maybe they're emphasizing points without meaning to. I've seen people do that when they're just being animated, not deceptive.  

The gaze down really sticks with me though—when people are being truthful, they often look at the person they're talking to, but here they're looking away consistently. That's a red flag for me. But then again, maybe they're avoiding eye contact because they're shy or the camera's making them uneasy, not because they're hiding something. I keep circling back to the eyebrows and mouth: those feel *too* pronounced for casual conversation. If they were just nervous about being recorded, would they do all those things at once?  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The signs lean toward deception—especially the exaggerated expressions and gaze avoidance—but without knowing the context (like if they're in a high-stakes interview or just chatting casually), it's risky to assume. I'd probably lean toward "maybe lying" because the markers line up more than the normal behavior, but I'd be nervous to call it definitive. It could just be their natural way of talking, or they could be genuinely stressed about something else. I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd feel confident either way.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior doesn't scream "lie" or "truth" in a super obvious way. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact (well, they're looking down, but that's not necessarily deceptive), and they've got their arms open, which usually feels like someone being relaxed or open—like they're not trying to hide anything. The raised eyebrows stand out a bit; it could be surprise at the question, or maybe they're genuinely processing it, but it doesn't feel like a nervous tic. The head moving forward toward the camera seems engaged, not like someone trying to create distance.

On the flip side, I know people can look calm while lying—some liars are really good at it, and "gaze down" is often flagged as a potential sign of deception in some studies, though I've read it's not reliable. Maybe they're just thinking hard about the answer, or maybe they're uncomfortable in the moment, not necessarily lying. The lack of frowning, scowling, or lip movements (like biting lips) is interesting—those are common nervous tells, so their calmness might actually lean toward truth. But then again, a practiced liar might suppress those things. I'm also wondering if the "arms open" is just their natural posture, not a deliberate sign of honesty.

I guess I'm leaning a bit toward them telling the truth because the overall vibe feels more like someone who's just answering thoughtfully, not someone who's stressed or trying to fake it. The absence of the usual "lie signals" (like avoiding gaze, fidgeting, forced smiles) makes it feel less like deception, even if it's not 100% proof. But I can't say for sure—maybe they're just really good at staying calm. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's more likely they're being truthful, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more certain. It's hard to judge without context, but the behavior here doesn't make me suspicious.

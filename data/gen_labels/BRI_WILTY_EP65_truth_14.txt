Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm while speaking. They're consistently looking at the person they're talking to—no darting eyes or avoiding gaze—which is actually one of the things that *doesn't* usually match the "liar" stereotype people expect. I'd expect someone lying to look away more, but here they're steady. And honestly, they don't seem nervous at all: no fidgeting with hands, no weird blinking, no tense jaw or anything like that. They just seem... relaxed while talking, like they're comfortable with what they're saying. 

That makes me lean toward them being truthful, because if they were lying, I'd probably see *some* sign of discomfort—like shifting in their seat or overcompensating with too much eye contact. But here, it feels natural. They're not acting like they're trying too hard to seem honest, which sometimes happens when people are lying. 

But then again, I know some people are just naturally chill, even when they're lying. Like, maybe they're good at hiding it, or they're just not the type to get flustered. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any visible tells—they might even *look* too calm, like they're just reciting facts. So it's possible they're lying and just happen to be one of those people who doesn't show it. 

Still, the way they're engaging—direct eye contact, no awkward pauses, just talking straightforwardly—it feels more like someone who's not hiding anything. I can't say for sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it seems more likely they're telling the truth. It’s not 100% proof, but it’s the strongest signal I’m picking up. If I had to guess without knowing anything else, I’d say they’re being honest. But yeah, it’s hard to be certain—there are always exceptions.

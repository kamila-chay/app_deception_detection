Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that nervous lip-biting thing people usually associate with lying. They're actually looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which is interesting because I've heard some people think liars avoid eye contact, but I guess that's not always true. They do glance sideways a few times, but that could just be them thinking or shifting their focus naturally—like when you're recalling something, right? Not sure if that's a red flag or not.

What stands out to me is they're raising their eyebrows a couple of times. I've seen that in honest conversations too—like when someone's surprised or emphasizing a point, not necessarily when they're making something up. And there's no scowling, no forced smiles, no awkward pauses where their mouth's just hanging shut. They seem engaged, like they're actually listening and processing. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those "tells"—like hands covering their mouth or shifting in their seat—but nothing like that here. 

But wait, could that sideways glance be a sign they're not being truthful? I mean, some people do look away when they're fabricating things, so that *could* be a tiny worry. But then again, they're still making eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. And the fact that they're not showing *any* of the classic stress cues—no blinking too fast, no tense jaw, no frowning—makes me lean toward thinking they're being genuine. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those little nervous ticks to pop up, even if it's subtle. 

Honestly, though, I'm not 100% sure. Humans are really bad at spotting lies, and sometimes truth-tellers get nervous too. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe they're used to being on camera. But based on what I'm seeing—the steady eye contact, the natural eyebrow movement, the lack of stress signals—I'd guess they're telling the truth. It just feels... quiet and consistent, not like someone who's trying to hide something. Still, I'd hesitate to say for sure. It's easy to second-guess, especially since the sideways look is a bit of a head-scratcher. But yeah, my gut says truth here.

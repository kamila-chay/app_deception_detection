Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful. The way their eyebrows are moving is really interesting—they're furrowing them (like they're confused or stressed) while simultaneously raising them up, almost like they're trying to look surprised but also tense. It feels a little off, like their face isn't matching what they're saying. And their gaze keeps flicking sideways while they're talking to the person across from them, which I've noticed before in situations where someone's trying to think of a response or avoid eye contact. They also tilt their head a couple of times, which can sometimes happen when people are processing something they're not comfortable with.  

But honestly, I'm not ruling out the possibility they're just nervous or stressed about the topic. I've seen people do all of that when they're genuinely trying to remember something or when they're in a high-pressure situation—like maybe they're answering a tough question on the spot, not necessarily lying. The fact that they're actually looking at the person they're talking to (not avoiding eye contact entirely) makes me think it might just be anxiety. And I know people can get really expressive with their eyebrows when they're focused, so maybe it's just their natural way of reacting.  

Still, the combination of the conflicting facial expressions and the sideways glances feels like a red flag to me. Like, if they were just telling the truth and feeling relaxed, their face would probably be more consistent—like if they were confused, they'd just furrow their brow without the raised part, or if they were trying to seem friendly, they might smile a little. But here, it's all this mixed-up energy. I'd say it's more likely deception than not, but I'm not putting money on it—I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation to be sure. It's the kind of thing where you'd say, "Hmm, that feels off," but you'd hesitate before accusing someone.

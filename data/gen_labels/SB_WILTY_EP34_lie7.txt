Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from a video, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. The person seems pretty animated with their eyebrows raised a lot, which usually makes me think they're either genuinely surprised by the question or trying to seem like they're processing something. Then there's that exaggerated mouth opening they do a few times—like they're forcing a smile or trying to look open, but their lips are actually kind of pushed out, which feels a bit unnatural to me. And they keep closing their mouth awkwardly, like they're hesitating mid-sentence, which makes me think they might be struggling to come up with an answer.

Their gaze is mostly down, which I know some people do when they're thinking, but it also makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact because they're not being straight with me. They're nodding a lot too, almost like they're overdoing it to seem cooperative, and the head tilting feels a bit exaggerated—like they're trying to seem engaged or thoughtful, but it doesn't quite match the rest of the cues. 

That said, I can totally see other reasons for this. Maybe they're just really nervous about being on camera, or they have a habit of raising their eyebrows when they concentrate. The mouth stuff could just be a nervous tic, not deception. Gaze down isn't always a lie—some people look away when they're trying to remember details, and the awkward pauses might just be them gathering their thoughts, not fabricating something. I've definitely seen people act this way when they're genuinely stressed about answering a question, not when they're lying. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The cues *do* lean a bit toward deception—especially the forced mouth movements and the avoidance of direct eye contact—but they're not the clearest signs. I'd be cautious about calling it a lie, but I'd also be a little suspicious. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd lean toward "maybe," but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying or see more context before I felt confident. It's easy to misread these things, and I don't want to jump to conclusions.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call without more context, but based on what I'm seeing in the video... the person is definitely holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to the whole time. Like, they're not looking away, not darting their eyes, just keeping that gaze directed at the other person. I've heard people say avoiding eye contact is a sign of lying, but honestly, I think that's not always true—sometimes truth-tellers actually *do* maintain better eye contact, especially if they're trying to seem sincere. And here, there's no sign of the usual nervous stuff: no fidgeting with hands, no awkward pauses where their mouth's shut tight, no raised eyebrows or weird blinking. It just seems... calm. Like they're just speaking naturally, not rehearsing or hiding anything.

But wait, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Maybe they're just really good at controlling themselves, or maybe they're not even nervous at all—could be a routine conversation they're comfortable with. Some people naturally make strong eye contact without lying, right? Like, if they're just really engaged or confident. And honestly, I've seen plenty of videos where people *do* lie with perfect eye contact, so it's not a perfect tell. The absence of "nervous" behaviors might just mean they're not stressed, not necessarily that they're being truthful. It could also be that the situation isn't high-stakes, so they're relaxed. I'd want to hear what they're actually saying too—sometimes the words matter more than the body language. But based *only* on what I'm seeing... the consistent eye contact and lack of other tells makes it feel more like they're being straightforward. Still, I'd hesitate to say "definitely truth" because body language alone isn't foolproof. It's just... the way they're sitting, the way they're looking at the person—it feels genuine, not forced. I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want more context before I'd be totally sure. Like, maybe they're just a calm person. Yeah, that's probably it.

Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person's behavior seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that "nervous" smile people sometimes fake. They're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which I usually associate with honesty, not lying. And they're nodding along, which feels like genuine engagement rather than trying to seem convincing. 

That raised eyebrow though... that's the part that makes me pause. Sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're trying to seem skeptical or even deceptive, like they're "testing" if someone's buying their story. But honestly, I've seen that happen a lot when people are just genuinely surprised or processing something, especially in casual conversation. It didn't look forced or exaggerated—just a natural moment of curiosity. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more classic "tells": maybe more blinking, avoiding gaze, or that stiff "closed-mouth" look people get when they're fabricating things. But here, they're relaxed, the gaze is steady, and they're not hiding anything with their hands. The lack of those "lie signs" actually feels more telling than the eyebrow. 

Still, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show stress, or maybe the context matters—like if they're nervous about something unrelated to the topic. But based *only* on what I'm seeing in the clip, the absence of anxiety cues and the natural eye contact/nodding make me lean toward them being truthful. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of behavior you'd see from someone trying to cover up a lie. But yeah, I'd hesitate to say it's definite—human behavior is messy, and without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to rule out everything. I'd probably say "truth" but with a big "maybe" attached.

Hmm, I'm trying to watch this clip and figure out if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because I don't have the context of what they're talking about, just the behavior. At first glance, they're frowning a little—like, not a full scowl, just those eyebrows pulled down a bit. That makes me pause because I've heard frowning can be a sign of stress, which sometimes happens when people are lying. But then again, I've seen people frown when they're just concentrating hard on what they're saying, like when they're trying to remember details or be careful with their words. It's not a clear sign either way.

What stands out more to me is how they're looking at the person they're talking to. They're not avoiding eye contact at all—they're actually maintaining eye contact while also glancing up and down a little, which seems normal when someone's thinking. I thought liars usually look away or seem distracted, but here they're engaged. There's no fidgeting either, like hands rubbing or touching their face, which I've heard is a common "tell" for deception. They're just sitting there, calm, with that mild frown. 

But then I keep circling back to that frown. Maybe they're lying and that's why they're stressed? Or maybe they're just naturally a bit serious, or even frustrated about the question? I don't know the situation, so it's hard to tell. The absence of other classic cues—like awkward pauses or shifting eyes—makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I can't rule out the frown as a stress indicator. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. If I had to guess right now, I'd say they're probably telling the truth because they're not hiding their eyes or acting nervous, but that frown is nagging at me. It's one of those cases where it's really ambiguous—could go either way depending on what they're talking about. I'd need more context to feel confident.

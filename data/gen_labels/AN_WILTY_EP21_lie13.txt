Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn on whether this person is lying or not. The most noticeable thing is that they keep their gaze down the whole time—like they're looking at the floor or their hands instead of making eye contact. Normally, when people lie, they might avoid eye contact to feel less exposed, so that *could* be a red flag. But honestly, people also look down when they're just thinking carefully, feeling shy, or even when they're being honest and processing what they're saying. I've seen a lot of people do that when they're answering questions seriously, not necessarily when they're hiding something.

What throws me off is how *calm* they seem otherwise. There's no fidgeting—no hands rubbing, no tapping, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed like they're searching for words. No raised eyebrows, no forced smiles, no signs of nervous energy at all. If they were lying, I'd expect to see *some* of those classic "stress" tells, like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. But they're completely still, just staring down quietly. That actually makes me lean toward them being truthful because it feels like they're just focused on what they're saying, not trying to cover up anything. 

But then I think, maybe they're a really good liar? Like, they've practiced so much they don't show any nervousness. But that seems less likely—most people don't get that good at hiding it, especially in a casual clip like this. And the down gaze alone isn't enough to prove deception; it's way too common for people to look down when they're just being thoughtful. I mean, I do it all the time when I'm trying to remember something. 

So yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but my gut says they're probably telling the truth. The lack of other "lie" signals outweighs the down gaze for me. It feels more like someone who's just being quiet and deliberate, not someone trying to hide something. But I'd want to see more context—like what they're being asked about—to feel more confident. Right now, it just seems like they're a calm person answering a question, not someone being deceptive.

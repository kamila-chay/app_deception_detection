Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or telling the truth just from watching, but I'd lean toward them being truthful based on what I'm seeing. They don't seem nervous at all—no fidgeting, no excessive blinking, no hands covering their face or anything like that. In fact, they're making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of sincerity. The way they're tilting their head slightly while speaking also seems relaxed, not forced or anxious. And they're looking down occasionally—like when they're thinking or being thoughtful—rather than avoiding eye contact entirely, which often happens when people are hiding something.  

But I can see why someone might question it too. Sometimes people who are lying *do* look down a lot, especially if they're trying to seem humble or avoid scrutiny. And the fact that they're not smiling or showing much expression at all could feel a little off—like they're being overly serious or rehearsed. If they were really lying, maybe they'd try to overcompensate with more "natural" gestures, but here it just feels... calm. Like they're just speaking plainly.  

The biggest thing that makes me doubt the "lying" idea is how *consistent* their behavior is. No sudden shifts in posture, no micro-expressions like a quick scowl or lip twitch. They just seem comfortable in the moment, which feels more like truth than deception. But I'm not 100% certain—people can lie without moving a muscle, and maybe they're just a naturally reserved person. Still, based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of behavior that's trying to hide something.

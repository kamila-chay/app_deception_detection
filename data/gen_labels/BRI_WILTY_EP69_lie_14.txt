Looking at the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn on this one. The person is nodding a lot and raising their eyebrows a few times, which jumps out at me—especially since they're not smiling or frowning, which I'd expect if they were being genuinely engaged or upset. The sideways glance they keep making feels a bit off, like they're not fully locking eyes with whoever they're talking to, and that's something I've heard people associate with lying. But then again, I've seen people glance sideways just because they're thinking hard or maybe they're not used to being recorded. 

The thing that makes me hesitate is how *calm* they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no lip biting, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck for words—they're moving smoothly, nodding like they're agreeing with the question. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like darting eyes or hands moving around, but they're pretty still except for those eyebrows and the head tilt. Sometimes when people are telling the truth and just feel a bit unsure, they'll raise their eyebrows like "huh, let me think about that," and nod to show they're processing. 

On the flip side, maybe the sideways gaze *is* a red flag—like they're looking away to construct a story. But I've also met people who just naturally avoid direct eye contact without any reason to hide anything. Honestly, the lack of other classic "lie signs" (like fake smiles or excessive blinking) makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. It's really hard to say without knowing the context of what they're talking about. If they were answering something super personal or stressful, I'd be more suspicious, but here it just feels like they're just... thinking out loud. I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear more of the conversation first to be safe.

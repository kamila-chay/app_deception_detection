Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out myself, and I'm not entirely sure. Watching the clip, the person seems to be smiling a bit, but it feels a little off—not like a warm, genuine smile. Their eyebrows are raised, which often happens when people are trying to seem friendly or engaged, but they also have this slight frown in their eyebrows at the same time, which is confusing. It’s like they’re forcing the smile while still showing tension. Then there’s the way they’re looking down a lot instead of meeting the person’s eyes, and their head keeps tilting sideways and moving forward like they’re trying to lean in but also pulling back. That makes me think they might be uncomfortable or avoiding direct contact, which can happen when someone’s not being completely honest. The chin moving up a few times too—like a little jerk—feels like nervous energy.  

But here’s where I hesitate: maybe they’re just really shy or stressed about the situation, not lying. Some people naturally frown when they’re concentrating, and the head tilting could just be a habit or how they process things. The smile might be their way of trying to seem calm, especially if they’re in an awkward spot. I’ve seen people do similar things when they’re just nervous about answering a question, not because they’re hiding something. And the fact that they’re still making eye contact sometimes (even if it’s downcast) might suggest they’re trying to be honest, not deceptive.  

Honestly, the mixed signals—smiling but with tense brows, looking away but leaning in—make me lean toward deception, but I can’t rule out that they’re just a naturally expressive person who gets flustered. I’d say it’s probably deception, but I’m not certain. It’s the kind of thing where if I heard them say the words, I might feel more confident, but just watching the body language? It’s a toss-up. I’d want to see more context before I’d be sure.

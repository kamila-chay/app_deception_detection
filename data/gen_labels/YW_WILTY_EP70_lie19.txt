Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those situations where the behavior feels a bit ambiguous. At first glance, they seem pretty engaged: they're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, and their arms are open, which often suggests they're not trying to shut down or hide. But then there are these little things that make me pause. They keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like, almost like they're skeptical or questioning what they're saying themselves—and their head is tilted slightly while they're talking, which I've noticed sometimes happens when people are trying to think of the right words or feel a bit on edge. Plus, they keep touching their head or face, like brushing their hair or adjusting their collar, which feels a bit nervous to me, though I know people do that when they're just thinking hard, not necessarily lying.  

On the other hand, I keep thinking maybe I'm reading too much into it. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact, aren't fidgeting with their hands in a way that seems deceptive (like crossing arms or covering their mouth), and aren't smiling or laughing unnaturally makes me wonder if they're just genuinely stressed about the question. Maybe they're a bit anxious about the situation—like, they're trying to be honest but feel pressured, so their body language is showing that tension. I've seen people do the same thing when they're answering something tough but telling the truth, and it's easy to mistake that for lying if you're not used to it.  

Honestly, the head tilting and the eyebrow raises are the parts that nudge me toward "maybe deception," but I'm not confident at all. It could just be their natural way of communicating when they're thinking. I'd need to see more context—like what they're actually saying or how they react to follow-up questions—to feel sure. Right now, I'm leaning a little toward "not lying," but I wouldn't bet on it. It's really hard to tell from just this clip alone.

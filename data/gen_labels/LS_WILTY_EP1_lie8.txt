Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tricky to tell from just this alone. The person has this kind of tight smile going on – not a full laugh, just the corners of their mouth pulled up a bit – and they're raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're genuinely surprised or skeptical about something. Their head's tilted and they keep moving it forward a little, like they're really trying to listen or process what's being said. That feels like engagement, not like someone who's trying to hide something. 

But then there's the hands touching their head a few times – once when they're talking, once when they pause. I've seen people do that when they're nervous or just thinking hard, but it's also a classic "telltale sign" people think means lying. And they're looking at the person talking to them most of the time, but sometimes glance sideways, which might make people think they're avoiding eye contact. But honestly, people glance sideways when they're thinking, not just when they're lying. 

On the flip side, I keep wondering if the smile is a bit too stiff? Like, it doesn't quite reach their eyes, which sometimes happens when someone's trying to be polite or hide their real feelings. And the head tilting... I've heard some people say that's a sign of deception, but I also know it can just be how someone naturally gestures when they're focused. 

The thing is, though, I'm not convinced it's deception. The lack of frowning, no exaggerated facial expressions, no obvious signs of stress like rapid blinking or covering their mouth – those are actually more consistent with someone being calm, even if they're not telling the whole truth. But calmness could also just mean they're confident in what they're saying. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person with that eyebrow thing, and the head movements are just them being attentive. 

Honestly, without more context – like what they're even talking about, or if there's a clear contradiction in what they're saying – it's really hard to pin down. The cues here feel more like nervous energy or just someone being very present in the conversation than like textbook deception. I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not at all certain. It could easily be the opposite, and I'd feel pretty bad if I jumped to a conclusion. People's natural mannerisms vary so much. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear the actual words before I'd feel confident about this one.

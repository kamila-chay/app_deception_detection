Okay, so I watched the clip a few times to be sure. The person seems pretty calm throughout—no fidgeting, no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiles, and they're actually making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That's interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but this person's gaze is steady, even looking up a bit while they're talking—like they're thinking, not hiding. Their hands are palms up and arms are open, which usually feels like someone being open and honest, not someone trying to cover something up. I don't see any nervous ticks either—no rapid blinking, no touching their face, nothing like that. 

But here's where I'm not totally sure: sometimes really practiced liars *do* use calm, open body language to seem trustworthy on purpose. Like, they might know the "signs" and actively avoid them. And the "gaze up" thing—I've read that some people look up when they're fabricating stories, not just recalling memories, so that could be a red flag if it's not natural. Also, the fact that there's no awkward pause or hesitation makes me think they're not struggling to make up a story, but that could just mean they're really prepared to lie smoothly. 

Honestly, though, the lack of classic deception cues (like the ones I've seen in other videos) makes me lean toward them telling the truth. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* sign of tension—maybe a little too much eye contact, or a subtle shift in posture. But here, everything feels... effortless. Like they're just answering a question normally. Still, I can't rule out deception entirely because people lie in all kinds of ways, and this might just be a really good liar who doesn't show the usual signs. I'd say I'm leaning toward "truthful" based on what I saw, but I'm not 100% certain—there's always room for that one subtle thing I might've missed.

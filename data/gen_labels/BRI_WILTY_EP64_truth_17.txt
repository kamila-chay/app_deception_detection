Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone answer a question, and the main thing I notice is they're frowning a little—like, their eyebrows are pulled down slightly, but it's not a full scowl or anything intense. They're not smiling, laughing, or doing any of those nervous little gestures people often associate with lying, like fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact. In fact, they seem pretty still, just looking at the camera with that quiet, focused frown. 

At first glance, that frown makes me wonder if they're stressed or maybe confused about the question, not necessarily lying. Like, when I'm trying to think of a good answer, I sometimes do that exact thing—just a little furrowed brow. And since they're not doing other classic "lie signs" (no rapid blinking, no awkward pauses, no hands covering their mouth), it feels more like they're genuinely thinking than trying to hide something. 

But I can see why someone might think they're lying. Frowning *can* sometimes be a sign of discomfort, and if the question was tricky or sensitive, that might make them tense up. Like, maybe they're uncomfortable with the topic, not necessarily lying. And honestly, frowning alone isn't a great indicator—it's super common for people to do it when they're concentrating, even when they're being totally honest. 

I guess what tips me toward "truthful" is the lack of other cues. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells—like shifting in their seat or glancing away. But they're just sitting there, quiet and focused, with that one subtle frown. It feels more like someone who's just being careful with their words than someone trying to deceive. I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing, it seems more likely they're telling the truth than lying. It’s hard to say for sure without knowing the context of the question, but the behavior doesn't scream deception to me.

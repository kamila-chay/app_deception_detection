Hmm, I'm watching this video and trying to figure out if the person is being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're staring right at the camera the whole time, which throws me off because I usually expect liars to avoid eye contact, but I've heard some people actually lean into it to seem more honest. And their eyes are really wide open—like, unnaturally so—almost as if they're trying to look extra innocent. I also notice their eyebrows are raised a bit, which feels a little forced, like they're faking surprise. That combination of staring intensely with wide eyes and raised brows makes me wonder if they're overcompensating to seem truthful.  

But then I keep thinking, maybe it's just how they naturally act. I mean, some people are just expressive like that—big eyes, raised eyebrows—when they're paying attention or genuinely surprised by a question. And the direct eye contact could just mean they're trying to be clear, not deceptive. I've seen people who are completely honest look this way when they're being earnest.  

Still, the way they hold that wide-eyed stare feels a bit stiff to me. Like, it's not the relaxed, natural eye contact I see when someone's telling the truth in casual chats. It’s almost like they're *trying* too hard to look innocent, which is a common sign of deception. But I can't be sure—maybe they're just nervous, or maybe they have a habit of doing that. Without knowing their baseline behavior, it's hard to say.  

I'm leaning toward them lying, but I'm not 100% convinced. It’s the kind of thing where if I had to guess, I'd say there's a decent chance they're not being truthful, but it’s not a slam dunk. There are just too many ways this could be innocent. I’d want more context before I’d feel confident either way.

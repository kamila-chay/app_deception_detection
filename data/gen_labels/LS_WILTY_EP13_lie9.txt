This is a bit complicated. Watching the clip, the person maintains a consistent smile, but it doesn't come across as entirely natural. Their lips are slightly pushed out, which seems somewhat forced rather than a warm, genuine smile. Their chin dips down a bit, as if they're pulling it in when they speak, which could suggest some underlying tension. 

They hold steady eye contact and nod often, which typically signals honesty, since liars often avert their gaze or fidget. There are no obvious nervous gestures like increased blinking or covering their mouth either. However, the tightness in their smile combined with the chin movement makes me wonder if they're trying a bit too hard to appear pleasant. The pursed lips and the subtle chin dip can sometimes be signs someone is controlling their expression to hide discomfort or deceit.

While their behavior could simply reflect someone who is naturally expressive or genuinely engaged, these particular cues lean towards a level of insincerity. Given the absence of classic tells but presence of subtle signs of tension, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that they might be lying, though I can’t be too sure. Without more context, it’s difficult to say definitively, but there’s enough here for me to suspect they could be less than truthful.

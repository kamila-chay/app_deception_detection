Examining this clip, there are subtle cues that make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive, though I wouldn't say it's certain. They remain fairly still without obvious discomfort signals like crossed arms or frowns, which might suggest openness. However, their frequent eyebrow raises and noticeably increased blinking could indicate nervousness, which often accompanies dishonesty. That said, these signs might also reflect genuine surprise or the mental effort of trying to recall details under pressure. The absence of eye contact avoidance or fidgeting tempers the suspicion somewhat, as these behaviors often align with deceit. Still, considering the combination of raised eyebrows and more rapid blinking, I find myself inclined to think they might not be telling the whole truth, though itâ€™s far from definitive. Without additional context or their verbal responses, my impression is more of a cautious suspicion leaning toward deception rather than a firm conclusion.

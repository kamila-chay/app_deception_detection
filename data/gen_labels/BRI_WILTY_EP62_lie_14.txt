Hmm, looking at this clip, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty still overall—no obvious smiles, frowns, or big gestures like crossing arms or shrugging. But I noticed they're raising their eyebrows quite a bit, like they're surprised or trying to process something, and their blinking feels a bit more frequent than usual. At first glance, that makes me lean toward "maybe lying" because people often get nervous when they're not being truthful, and those are common stress signs. But then I keep thinking, "Wait, could it just be them being genuinely confused or stressed about the question?" Like, maybe they're trying hard to remember details, or the interview setting is making them anxious—not necessarily because they're hiding something. I mean, I've seen people blink a lot when they're just tired or in a bright room, and raised eyebrows can just be a natural reaction to a tough question, not deception. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting much makes me doubt the "lying" angle a bit more. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it's possible they're being evasive, but it's also totally plausible they're just a bit flustered. I'd want to hear more of their answers or see the context of the question before I'd feel confident either way. It feels like a maybe, but not a definite "yes."

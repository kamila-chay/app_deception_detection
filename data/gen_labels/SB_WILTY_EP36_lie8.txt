Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I'd lean toward them *not* lying, though it's tricky. The way they're nodding while talking and keeping their gaze mostly on the person they're speaking to feels pretty natural—like they're engaged and trying to be clear, not avoiding eye contact like some people think liars do. Their raised eyebrows and the little chin movements (up and down) seem more like they're emphasizing points or thinking hard, not necessarily nervousness from lying. I've seen people do that when they're genuinely trying to explain something, especially if they're a bit passionate or frustrated.  

But I can see why someone might think it's deception too. The sideways head tilt and the way they glance off to the side while talking could look like they're searching for words, which sometimes happens when people are fabricating. And the raised eyebrows *do* sometimes show up in deceptive behavior, like when someone's trying to seem surprised or innocent. If I didn't know the context, I'd wonder if they were rehearsing or holding back something.  

Still, the lack of other classic signs stands out—no awkward pauses, no fidgeting, no fake smiles or forced calm. They seem pretty animated in a way that feels genuine, not like they're putting on an act. The chin moving up and down especially feels like a natural speech tic, like when you're getting worked up about something. Honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to say for sure. It could be them being defensive or just expressive, but it doesn't scream "lying" to me like some clips do. I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet money on it—behavior alone isn't always the best clue.

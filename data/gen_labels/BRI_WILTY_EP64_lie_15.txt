Looking at the clip, the person holds their palms up openly, seemingly trying to convey honesty, and they remain calm and steady without fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. Normally, such stillness might suggest truthfulness, since liars often display nervous behaviors like touching their face or shifting around. The palms-up gesture can also be an attempt to appear trustworthy, like saying "I've got nothing to hide." 

However, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might be lying. Some people are skilled at hiding the usual signs of deception by deliberately maintaining a calm demeanor. The stillness and open palms could be a calculated move rather than a genuine signal of honesty. Additionally, this gesture could just be a natural posture or a nervous habit, not necessarily an indication of truthfulness. The clip might not show the entire context either, possibly missing moments when signs of deception surface.

While there's a lack of clear deception cues, I think it's reasonable to lean slightly toward the possibility that they're not being entirely truthful. The controlled behavior feels a bit rehearsed, and without more of the interaction, it's hard to fully trust the impression they're giving.

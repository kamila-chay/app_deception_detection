Looking at the clip, the person seems to be holding their palms up openly, like they're trying to show they're being honest, and that's pretty much the only thing I notice. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird blinking or shifting around—just them standing there with their hands up, calm and steady. That makes me lean toward thinking they're being truthful because when people are lying, they often do stuff like touch their face, look away, or fidget, but here it's all really still. The palms-up thing especially feels like a gesture people use when they want to seem trustworthy, like "I've got nothing to hide."

But then I keep second-guessing myself because, honestly, some people are really good at lying without showing obvious signs—they might even deliberately act calm to seem innocent. I've heard that if someone's practiced at deception, they can suppress all the usual tells, so the lack of movement might not mean anything at all. Plus, in some contexts, palms up can be a nervous habit or just a random gesture, not necessarily tied to truthfulness. Like, maybe they're just stretching their arms out or it's how they naturally stand. It’s also possible the video cuts off right before they’d start fidgeting, so I’m not seeing the whole picture.

Honestly, I’m not totally sure. The absence of deception cues is pretty strong for truthfulness, but I can’t completely rule out that they’re hiding something well. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth based on what’s visible, but I’d want to see more of the interaction or hear the conversation to be confident. It’s one of those cases where the silence and stillness feel honest, but you never really know for sure.

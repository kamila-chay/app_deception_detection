This is tricky to call just from the video alone, but here's how I'm reading it. The person is making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to (that "gaze towards interlocutor" thing), which actually feels a bit unusual for someone who's lying—most people who're deceptive tend to look away more, right? But they also have these sideways glances, which could be nervous habit or just how they naturally move their eyes while thinking. I keep noticing them nodding while they speak, and that's something I've seen a lot in genuine conversations—like when someone's really engaged or trying to emphasize a point. 

On the flip side, I wonder if those sideways glances *are* a sign of deception. Sometimes people glance away when they're fabricating something, even if they're still looking at the other person overall. And the lack of any obvious "tells" like fidgeting or forced smiles makes me think they might be trying hard to seem calm, which could backfire if they're actually stressed. But honestly, the absence of those classic "lie cues" (no lip biting, no exaggerated blinking) makes me lean a bit toward them being truthful—it feels like they're just a bit reserved or thoughtful, not necessarily hiding something. 

Still, I'm not 100% sure. People can be really good at controlling their expressions, and maybe they're just naturally quiet or shy. The nodding and eye contact seem genuine, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more confident. I guess I'm leaning toward "truthful" but with a lot of "maybe" in there—like, it's not screaming deception, but it's not a clear "all clear" either. It feels like they're just being a little awkward, not necessarily lying.

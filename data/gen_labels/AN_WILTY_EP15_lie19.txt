Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to and nodding along like they're genuinely engaged—those are usually signs of someone being truthful, right? Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to look away or seem distracted, but they're holding that gaze and nodding like they're fully in the conversation. That part leans toward them telling the truth.

But then there's the finger-crossing. They're doing it pretty clearly—like, they're actively crossing their fingers while talking. I've heard that's sometimes a nervous habit people do when they're trying to "cover" something or hoping for luck, which could hint at deception. Like, maybe they're worried about what they're saying and subconsciously trying to "undo" it. But honestly, I've also seen people cross their fingers just out of habit—like when they're stressed about something unrelated, say, waiting for a bus or hoping for good weather. It doesn't *have* to mean they're lying.

The thing is, there's nothing else that screams "liar" here. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird pauses or fake smiles. If they were being deceptive, I'd expect more of those classic signs—like the eyes darting away or a forced laugh—but they're just... calm. So maybe the finger-crossing is just a quirk. It's tricky because humans are bad at reading lies anyway; we often misinterpret nervousness as dishonesty. Like, I get super nervous when I'm trying to explain something simple, and I might fidget, but that doesn't mean I'm lying. 

All in all, I'm leaning toward them being truthful because of the eye contact and nodding, but that finger-crossing is nagging at me. If I had to guess without knowing anything else, I'd say probably not lying—but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just one small thing that could easily be innocent. Maybe they're just superstitious!

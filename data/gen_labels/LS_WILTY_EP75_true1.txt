Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "lie" or "truth" at me—it's more subtle. First off, they're nodding a lot and keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually makes me lean toward them being genuine. When people lie, they often avoid eye contact or seem stiff, but here they're actually looking at the person while nodding like they're actively engaged. That feels like a good sign. They also have raised eyebrows a few times—like when they're processing something—instead of frowning or looking down, which I've noticed often happens when someone's trying to remember a lie. 

But then there's the lips retracted thing—like their lips are pulled back a little, almost like they're concentrating or holding something in. I've seen that in people who are nervous, but it's not the same as a forced smile or frown. Could that be a sign they're rehearsing? Maybe. And they're looking up a lot while talking, which some people say indicates recalling memories (which might be truthful), but others argue it's a sign of lying because they're "making it up." I'm not sure which one applies here. 

The other thing is, they don't seem to be fidgeting at all—no hand rubbing, no awkward pauses, no excessive blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that nervous energy, but they're calm. Still, calmness isn't proof of truth either—some liars are really good at staying cool. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The absence of classic "lie" cues (like avoiding eye contact or looking away) makes me think they're probably being truthful, but I can't rule out that the lips retracted or the gaze up might be part of a practiced calmness. It's not definitive, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like someone who's just speaking naturally than someone who's hiding something. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but my gut says "truth" here—just because everything seems... effortless, not forced. Like they're just telling a story without trying too hard. But yeah, it's definitely not 100% clear-cut.

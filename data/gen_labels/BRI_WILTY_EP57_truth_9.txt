Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not based on what I see. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people act differently when they're stressed or lying, but there's no obvious "tell" jumping out at me. What stands out is how steady their gaze is—they're looking directly at the person they're talking to, and also glancing up and sideways like they're thinking or recalling something. I've noticed that when people are being honest about memories, they often keep eye contact or look up like they're mentally searching for details, not avoiding it. 

I don't see any of the classic nervous habits people sometimes show when lying: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed, no raised eyebrows or scowling. They're just sitting there, calm, with their hands still. That actually feels more like someone who's relaxed and not trying to hide anything. I know some people lie without any visible signs, especially if they're practiced, but the lack of stress cues here makes me lean toward truth. 

But I should say, it's not a slam dunk. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm under pressure, or maybe they're lying about something they don't feel emotionally invested in, so they don't get flustered. I've seen people who lie about boring stuff—like where they parked their car—and stay completely cool. So it's possible they're not being truthful, but the behavior itself doesn't scream "lie" to me. 

Honestly, based on what's in the video, the consistency of their eye contact and the absence of nervous energy makes me think they're probably telling the truth. But I'm not 100% sure—without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to be definitive. It just feels more aligned with someone being genuine than deceptive, given what I'm seeing.

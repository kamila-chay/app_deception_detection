Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd say the person seems pretty calm and direct in their delivery. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're speaking to—looking right at them, not glancing away or down—and their gaze is actually up, not down or sideways. That feels more like someone recalling something they know well, not someone scrambling to make up a story. I've heard people say "looking up" can mean lying, but I think that's usually when someone's *avoiding* eye contact while looking up, like they're trying to hide. Here, they're looking *at* the person while their eyes are up, which seems more like they're thinking clearly.  

Also, there's nothing really fidgety or nervous about them—no quick blinking, no hands moving around, no shifting in their seat. If they were lying, I'd expect to see *some* of those little tells, like touching their face or avoiding eye contact. But they're just sitting there, relaxed, with their head still. The fact that they're not smiling or frowning either—it's neutral, which actually feels more genuine. Liars sometimes overdo expressions to seem convincing, but this feels... quiet. Like they're just answering straightforwardly.  

That said, I'm not 100% certain. Some people are really good at hiding their nerves, especially if they've practiced or are used to being on camera. Maybe they're just naturally calm, or maybe they're so rehearsed that the lack of tells is part of the act. And honestly, "gaze up" could be misinterpreted—I've seen people argue both ways about that. But overall, the combination of steady eye contact, no nervous gestures, and that neutral-but-engaged posture makes me lean toward them telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like the kind of behavior that's trying to cover something up. Still, you can't rule out the possibility entirely—there are always exceptions. But based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're being honest.

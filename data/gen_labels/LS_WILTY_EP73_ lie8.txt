Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. I see the person is talking to someone, and they're definitely keeping their eyes on the other person (gaze towards interlocutor is true), but they're also looking down quite a bit—like, their eyes are focused downward while still facing the speaker. That downcast gaze makes me think they might be uncomfortable or trying to avoid direct eye contact, which I've heard can sometimes happen when people are not being fully truthful. They're also raising their eyebrows a lot, which feels a bit odd—like they're reacting to something they're saying, maybe trying to seem surprised or skeptical about their own story? And they keep tilting their head to the side, which usually seems like a sign of engagement or curiosity, but in this context, it’s hard to tell if it’s genuine or just nervous energy.

On the flip side, though, they’re not fidgeting at all—no hand rubbing, no lip biting, no obvious signs of stress like rapid blinking. If they were lying, I’d expect them to be a bit more restless, right? The fact that they’re so still while talking could actually suggest they’re trying to seem calm and collected, which liars sometimes do. And the head tilt is a bit confusing—it’s not the classic "liar's head shake," but it’s not a clear sign of deception either. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive when they’re speaking. 

I also wonder if the down gaze is just because they’re shy or distracted by something else entirely—like they’re thinking hard about what to say, not necessarily lying. People often look down when they’re concentrating, whether they’re being honest or not. And the raised eyebrows... that could just be their normal way of talking, especially if they’re emphasizing a point. Honestly, I’m not sure. The behaviors don’t scream "liar" to me, but they also don’t feel like a clear sign of truth either. It’s the kind of thing where without knowing the context—like what they’re even talking about—I’d have to lean on gut feeling. If I had to guess, I’d say maybe they’re not fully comfortable, but I wouldn’t bet money on it. Could easily be a nervous truth-teller instead of a liar. I’d want to see more of the conversation before I’d feel confident about this one.

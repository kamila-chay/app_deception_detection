Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they don't seem to be doing much at all—no obvious nervous ticks or fake smiles. The only thing that stands out is they're raising their eyebrows a few times, like when they're processing something or maybe genuinely surprised by the question. But that's it. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird pauses where they're clearly trying to think of a story. 

I've seen a lot of videos where people lie and they'll do things like blink a lot, touch their face, or look away—none of that here. In fact, the way they're sitting still and just answering directly makes me lean toward them being honest. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect *something* else to feel off, even if it's subtle. But they seem calm, almost too calm? Wait, no—calm can be normal too, especially if they're just telling the truth. 

But then I think: maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show any of the usual signs. Like, some people don't get nervous when they lie, so they'd just sit there like this. Or maybe the eyebrow thing *is* a sign they're lying—like, when people are deceptive, they sometimes raise their eyebrows involuntarily to seem more sincere? I'm not sure if that's a real thing though. I've heard that in some contexts, but I don't think it's reliable. 

Honestly, the biggest thing that makes me doubt the "lie" label is how *unremarkable* they seem. If they were lying, I'd expect a little more tension in their face or voice, but it's just... quiet. Like they're answering a simple question they know the answer to. But I can't be 100% sure—maybe the lie is so rehearsed it feels natural. I'd probably ask them to repeat the part about X to see if they stumble, but in the clip, they don't. 

So yeah, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just because there's nothing *wrong* with their behavior, but I'm not confident. It's possible they're lying and just not showing it, or maybe the eyebrow thing is a red herring. Hard to say for sure without more context. If I had to guess based on what I see, I'd say truth, but I'd want to check again.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip and trying to figure out if they're lying or not based on what I see. The person seems pretty calm at first glance, but there are a few things that stand out. They're not smiling or laughing, which I'd expect if they were relaxed and telling the truth about something straightforward. Instead, their eyebrows are raised a lot—like they're genuinely surprised or maybe trying to seem surprised? And their eyes are really wide open, almost exaggerated, like they're staring right at the camera to emphasize they're being honest. Then there's the palms-up gesture, which usually feels like an open, "I'm telling the truth" thing, right? But I've heard that sometimes people do that when they're lying to seem more sincere.  

On the other hand, they're not avoiding eye contact—they're actually looking at whoever's talking to them (or the camera), which is a bit confusing because I thought liars often look away. But maybe they're trying too hard to keep eye contact, like it feels forced? The raised eyebrows and wide eyes could just be nervousness from being on camera, not deception. Like, maybe they're just a bit anxious about being recorded, not necessarily lying. And the palms-up thing—I've seen a lot of people do that when they're being earnest, even when they're not lying.  

But here's where I'm stuck: if they *were* lying, the exaggerated eye opening and raised eyebrows might be their way of overcompensating—like they're trying so hard to look trustworthy that it comes off as fake. The palms-up could be part of that too, a calculated gesture. But if they're telling the truth, those same cues might just be their natural reaction to the question, especially if they're genuinely caught off guard. I don't see any fidgeting, awkward pauses, or lip movements that I'd associate with lying.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. I'd lean toward deception just because the combination feels a bit "off"—the eyebrows and eyes are so pronounced, like they're trying to sell a story. But I'm not confident at all. It could easily be their normal way of expressing themselves, or they're just nervous. Without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's almost impossible to tell. I'd say it's probably deception, but I'd hesitate to bet on it—there are just too many ways this could be read the other way. Maybe I'm overthinking it, though.

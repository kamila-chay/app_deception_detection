Honestly, while some of the cues seem to suggest honesty—like their steady eye contact and lack of nervous gestures—there are a few things that raise some doubts for me. The scowl stands out as unusual, since people who are lying often try to appear neutral or even friendly to gain trust, rather than showing annoyance. The repeated eyebrow raises and head tilts might hint at confusion, but those same gestures can sometimes be subtle signs of deception, especially when combined with other mixed signals. Their head shaking could simply be disagreement, but paired with a possibly insincere shrug, it might be an attempt to appear casual while dodging the truth. The absence of more obvious nervous behaviors is notable, but that doesn’t completely clear things up. Considering all this, I find myself leaning slightly toward the idea that they might be lying, though I wouldn’t say it’s certain. It feels like some of their reactions don't quite fit a straightforward honest response, but they could also be genuinely frustrated. Without knowing the specific context or question, it’s hard to be sure, but on balance, I’m inclined to suspect some level of deception.

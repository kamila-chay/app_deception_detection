Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because the cues are kind of mixed up. At first glance, the person seems pretty calm—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, and they're actually looking right at the person talking to them, which usually makes me lean toward truth-telling. But then there's that scowl, which feels off because liars often try to look neutral or even smile to seem trustworthy, not scowl like they're annoyed. That *does* make me pause. They also keep raising their eyebrows and tilting their head, which could just mean they're confused or processing something, but I've heard some people say raised eyebrows can signal deception when paired with other signs.  

The head shaking is tricky too—it’s a clear "no" gesture, but it could just be them disagreeing with what they’re being asked, not necessarily lying. And the shrug? That usually feels like someone being honest about not knowing something, which doesn’t scream deception. But then again, maybe they’re *faking* that shrug to seem casual while lying. I mean, the absence of classic signs like lip biting or avoiding eye contact definitely leans toward truth, but that scowl is throwing me. Like, why would someone scowl while lying? If they were just annoyed by the question, that might explain it—but if they’re lying, the scowl feels out of place.  

On the flip side, maybe they’re not lying at all and just have a really strong reaction to the topic. Like, maybe they’re genuinely frustrated about whatever’s being discussed, and that’s why they’re scowling. The head tilt and direct gaze feel like they’re trying to engage honestly, not hide something. But I can’t rule out that they’re a good liar who’s not showing the usual tells. Honestly, I’d probably need to hear the actual question they’re answering to feel more sure. Right now, I’m leaning toward *not* lying because the behavior feels more like frustration than deception, but I’d be really cautious—I’ve seen people pull off deception so smoothly it’s hard to tell. It’s just not adding up like a typical lie scenario.

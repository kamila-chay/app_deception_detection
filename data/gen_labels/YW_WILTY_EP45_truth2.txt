Hmm, looking at the video, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth. The way they're holding their gaze directly at whoever they're talking to feels pretty solid for honesty—like they're not avoiding eye contact, which often happens when people are being deceptive. And their arms being open, not crossed, that usually reads as more relaxed and approachable, not defensive. They're nodding along too, which feels natural for someone engaged in a conversation, not like they're trying to fake agreement.

But then there are those little nervous ticks—frequent blinking, scratching their head a few times, and that chin moving up and down a bit. I've seen people do that when they're just stressed or self-conscious, especially if they're being filmed, so it doesn't *have* to mean they're lying. Maybe they're just a bit anxious about the situation, not the content. The raised eyebrows and sideways glances could also just be part of how they express themselves when thinking, not necessarily hiding something. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, why would they keep looking directly at the person? Liars sometimes look away or glance up to "think," but here they're doing that *and* keeping eye contact. The head tilting sideways might seem odd, but it could just be a natural gesture while listening. I guess the main thing that gives me pause is the blinking and scratching—they're common in nervousness, but I don't think they're strong enough on their own to override the direct eye contact and open posture. Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure with just body language. People get fidgety for all sorts of reasons, and this feels more like someone who's a bit tense about being on camera than someone trying to cover up a lie. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's too much room for misreading these cues.

Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's really tricky. What stands out to me is how they're smiling and raising their eyebrows while talking, which feels a bit off for the context. Like, they seem to be trying to appear friendly or maybe even overly agreeable, but the smile doesn't quite reach their eyes, and those raised eyebrows look a little forced, like they're anticipating a question or trying to seem surprised. Then there's the way they keep looking down instead of meeting the person's gaze directly, which sometimes happens when someone's uncomfortable or hiding something. And that head tilt—they're constantly tilting it slightly, which usually means they're engaged or curious, but paired with the other cues, it makes me wonder if it's a nervous habit.

But honestly, I could be completely wrong. Maybe they're just naturally expressive—some people smile a lot and tilt their heads when they're thinking, and the downward gaze might just be their default way of listening. I've seen people who are totally honest do the same things, especially if they're shy or just used to that mannerism. The smile could even be genuine, like they're genuinely trying to be pleasant. I'm not going to say they're lying for sure, but the combination of those micro-expressions and the avoidance of direct eye contact makes me lean toward it being deceptive, even if I'm not 100% certain. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

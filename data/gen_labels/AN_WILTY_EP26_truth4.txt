Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always clear-cut. What stands out to me is that they're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—and they're nodding along while speaking. That feels pretty natural, like they're engaged and confirming what they're saying, which often happens when people are being truthful. They also raise their eyebrows a few times, which seems like a subtle expression of interest or emphasis, not something I'd typically associate with lying. 

But then there's the gaze down part—looking downward while they talk. I know some people do that when they're lying, trying to avoid eye contact, but it could also just mean they're thinking carefully about what to say. Truth-tellers sometimes look down when they're recalling details or being thoughtful, so it's not a sure sign of deception. And honestly, there's nothing else that jumps out at me as suspicious: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of tension like frowning or excessive blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells—like shifting in their seat or avoiding eye contact entirely—but they're not doing that. 

Still, I can't rule it out completely. Maybe they're just a calm person who doesn't get nervous, or maybe the gaze down is a habit unrelated to honesty. It's hard to say without more context, like what they're actually saying or the situation. But based on what I'm seeing—no red flags, just steady eye contact, nodding, and natural expressions—it leans toward them being truthful. I mean, it's not a slam dunk, but it feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying than someone hiding something. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

This is a bit challenging to assess solely from the video, but based on what I’m observing, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying. They’re definitely smiling, though it seems somewhat wide and possibly forced, as if they’re trying to appear friendly rather than genuinely happy. Their eye behavior is also puzzling—they’re looking directly at the other person, which could signal honesty, yet their eyes frequently flick downward. This downward gaze feels off, like they might be uncomfortable or attempting to avoid full transparency. While their open palms typically suggest honesty, it’s worth noting that this gesture can be deliberately used to create an impression of trustworthiness even when deceptive.

On the other hand, they don’t display many of the classic signs of lying, such as fidgeting, unusual blinking, or complete avoidance of eye contact. If they were lying, I might expect more visible nervousness or signs of discomfort, like face touching or shifting position. It’s possible they’re naturally calm, or perhaps the smile and downward gaze stem from shyness or thoughtful consideration rather than deceit.

All things considered, though, the combination of a somewhat forced smile and the inconsistent eye movement leads me to lean toward the idea that they may not be fully truthful. It’s not a definitive conclusion—there’s room for doubt—but the subtle cues suggest a higher likelihood of deception than honesty in this case. Without additional context or observation in different settings, it’s difficult to be certain, but I’d cautiously guess that they’re probably not telling the whole truth.

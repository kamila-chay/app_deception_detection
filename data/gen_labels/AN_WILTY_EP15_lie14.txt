Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video, honestly. I'm watching someone who's speaking to another person, and they're definitely smiling – it's a bit wide, like they're trying to seem friendly or maybe even a little forced? But I'm not sure if it's genuine or just a mask. They're also looking directly at the person they're talking to, which is good for seeming honest, but at the same time, their eyes keep flicking downward a lot – like they're avoiding direct eye contact by looking down slightly while still facing the other person. That downward gaze feels off, like they might be uncomfortable or trying not to be caught. And their palms are open and facing up, which usually signals honesty, but I've heard people do that on purpose when they're lying to seem more trustworthy.  

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the classic "liar tells" – no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no frowning, and they're not avoiding eye contact entirely. If they were really lying, I'd expect more nervousness, like touching their face or shifting around. Maybe they're just naturally calm, or maybe they're actually telling the truth and the smile is just them being polite. The downward gaze could just be shyness or them thinking hard about what to say, not deception.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The smile and the downward gaze make me lean toward "maybe lying," but the lack of other stress cues makes me doubt it. People often think liars avoid eye contact, but sometimes they overcompensate by staring too hard, and here they're looking *at* the person but down. It feels like a mix – not super obvious, but the little things add up. I'd say it's probably deception, but I'm not 100% sure. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need more context or to see them in a different setting to be certain. Like, maybe they’re just nervous about the topic, not necessarily lying. But based on what I’m seeing, the signs point more toward deception than truth, even if it’s not a slam dunk.

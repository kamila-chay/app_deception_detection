Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them possibly not being truthful—though I could easily be wrong. The thing that sticks out is that slight upward pull at the corners of their mouth. It's not a full smile or laughter, just that little lift, and it feels... off? Like they're trying to seem friendly or calm but it's not quite reaching their eyes. I've noticed that when people fake a smile while lying, it often looks stiff or doesn't match their expression otherwise. 

Then there's the way they're looking down—almost like they're avoiding eye contact with whoever they're talking to. I've heard that people who are deceptive sometimes glance away or look down, maybe to process the lie or avoid being caught. The chin movements too—up and down while they're speaking—seem a bit repetitive, like they're rehearsing what to say or nervous about the words coming out. 

But here's why I'm hesitant: they don't seem overly stressed. No rapid blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no obvious signs of anxiety like sweating or shaky voice (though I can't hear it, so that's a gap). Sometimes people just have a natural way of moving their chin when they talk, or they might just be shy or distracted. Maybe they're just uncomfortable in the situation, not lying. The absence of classic "lie" cues makes me wonder if it's just them being quiet or thoughtful. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up. If I had to guess without hearing the conversation, I'd say deception is possible because of that forced smile and the downcast gaze, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It could easily be a genuine reaction to something awkward. I'd want to hear the audio or see more context before I felt confident either way. But based on the visual alone, the little things add up to me leaning toward "not telling the whole truth," even if I'm not totally sure.

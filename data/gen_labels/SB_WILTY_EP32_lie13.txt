Looking at the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—honestly, it's pretty ambiguous. The person seems a bit tense, especially with how often they're blinking. I've noticed that when people are stressed or trying to think of something, they blink a lot, but it's also super common for anyone to blink more when they're being recorded, right? Like, maybe they're just nervous about the camera, not necessarily lying.  

Then there's the chin thing—they keep moving it up and down, like little jabs or shakes. I've heard that sometimes people do that when they're being evasive or thinking hard about what to say, but it could also just be a nervous habit. I mean, I've seen people do that when they're trying to sound calm, not when they're lying. And their gaze? They look down a lot and glance sideways, which usually makes people think someone's avoiding eye contact. But wait—the description says they *do* look at the person they're talking to sometimes, so it's not like they're completely avoiding it. Maybe they're just uncomfortable with the situation, like if they're answering a tough question but being honest.  

They're nodding a lot while speaking, which usually means agreement or engagement, but it can also be a nervous tic. Like, if someone's trying to seem cooperative while lying, they might overdo the nods. But again, it could just be their natural way of talking. The thing that sticks out the most is the lack of other "obvious" signs—no forced smiles, no fidgeting, no lip biting. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical tells, like touching their face or looking away constantly. But here, they're mostly still, which makes me wonder if it's actually just a normal conversation with someone who's a bit anxious.  

On the flip side, the combination of frequent blinking *and* those chin movements *and* the gaze shifts... yeah, that could add up to deception. Like, if they're trying to control their expressions but it's slipping through. But honestly? I've seen people do all those things while being completely truthful—like when you're trying not to seem nervous during a job interview. It's really hard to tell without knowing what they're being asked or how they normally act. I'd lean toward "maybe" they're lying because of those subtle cues, but I wouldn't bet on it. It feels more like they're just stressed than deliberately deceptive. Like, maybe they're answering a question they're not sure about, not necessarily making something up. I'd need more context to feel confident either way.

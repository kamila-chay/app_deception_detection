Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video. On one hand, the person seems really open—direct eye contact, leaning in slightly, palms up and arms open like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything. That’s usually a sign people use when they’re being straightforward, right? Like, they’re not crossing their arms or looking away, which I’d expect if they were nervous or hiding something. The way they’re holding their hands out and keeping their posture relaxed feels... genuine? It’s not the kind of body language I’d associate with lying, especially since there’s no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no signs of stress like quick blinking or avoiding eye contact. If anything, it feels like they’re trying to be extra clear.

But then I keep second-guessing myself because I’ve heard that some people who lie *do* mimic open body language to seem trustworthy—like they’ve practiced it. Maybe they’re just really good at faking calm? Or maybe they’re not lying about this specific thing but are just naturally expressive in a way that looks "too" open. I mean, not everyone who’s honest has those exact cues, and not everyone who’s lying has the classic "nervous" signs. It could be that they’re telling the truth about something they’re confident about, so the open posture just makes sense for them. But then again, the video’s label says deception, so maybe there’s something subtle I’m missing that’s not showing in the body language—like tone of voice or something I can’t see. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. The behavior *looks* truthful, but I’d want to hear the actual words they’re saying to be more certain. I’d lean toward them being truthful based on what I see, but I wouldn’t bet money on it. It feels like they’re being honest, but I can’t rule out they’re just really good at pretending.

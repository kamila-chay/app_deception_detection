Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but watching this clip, I'd lean toward them *not* lying—though I'm really not confident. The way they're smiling and raising their eyebrows feels a bit... rehearsed? Like they're trying to seem extra friendly or agreeable, which sometimes happens when people are nervous but not necessarily lying. But then again, they're making solid eye contact with whoever's talking to them, and their palms are open—both things I usually associate with being straightforward. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that stiff, fake smile people sometimes do. Here, the smile seems natural, and the eyebrow raise is just a quick, almost surprised reaction—not like they're forcing it. 

But wait, I could be totally wrong. Maybe the smile is a classic "lie smile"—like when someone grins to cover up discomfort. And the open palms? I've heard some people do that *on purpose* to seem honest when they're actually hiding something. Plus, the fact that they're not blinking a lot or looking away makes me wonder if they're just really calm, not necessarily truthful. Honestly, humans are terrible at spotting lies, and this feels like one of those cases where it's really ambiguous. I'd probably ask them a follow-up question to see if their story holds up, but just based on this clip? I'm torn. It *feels* more like they're being genuine than deceptive, but I'd definitely want more context before I'd bet on it.

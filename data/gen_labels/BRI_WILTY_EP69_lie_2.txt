Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. So, the person is talking to someone, and they're definitely looking at the person they're speaking to most of the time—that's the "gaze towards interlocutor" being true. But I also notice they keep glancing sideways, like maybe checking something off to the side or just shifting their focus a bit. That sideways glance feels a little off to me, especially since they're not looking down or away completely, just flicking their eyes sideways while still seeming to face the person. I've heard that when people are lying, they sometimes do that—like they're trying to appear attentive but can't quite hold the direct gaze without slipping into a quick side glance. 

But here's where it gets confusing. They're not doing any of the other classic "nervous" things: no blinking a lot, no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or frowns. In fact, they seem pretty calm and composed, which makes me wonder if maybe they're just naturally like that—some people don't fidget when they're talking, even if they're being honest. Or maybe they're really good at hiding it, which could actually lean toward deception since practiced liars often don't show obvious signs. 

On the flip side, the sideways glance might just be a habit or something they do when thinking—like they're trying to remember a detail, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that all the time when they're just processing what they're saying. And since they're maintaining eye contact overall, that feels more like truth-telling to me, because liars often avoid eye contact more consistently. But then again, some liars overcompensate by staring too hard, so it's hard to say. 

Honestly, I'm not totally sure. The sideways glance is the red flag for me, but the lack of other tells makes it feel ambiguous. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd lean a little toward them not being completely truthful—maybe they're being evasive about something—but it's really close. It could just be them being a bit distracted or thoughtful, not lying. I'd want to hear more of the conversation or see more context before I'd feel confident either way. It's one of those moments where the behavior is subtle enough that it's easy to second-guess yourself.

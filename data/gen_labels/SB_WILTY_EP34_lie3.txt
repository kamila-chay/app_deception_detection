Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because it's really tricky to tell just from body language alone. The person's behavior doesn't scream "lying" to me at first glance—like, they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting a ton, which are things people often associate with deception. They have raised eyebrows and a bit of exaggerated mouth opening, which could look nervous, but I've seen people do that when they're just trying to emphasize a point or get their words out, not necessarily when they're hiding something. 

What stands out more is the way they're looking—gazing up and sideways a lot, not directly at the person they're talking to. I know some people think that's a classic "lie sign," but actually, research shows that when people are recalling actual memories (like trying to remember a real event), they often look up or sideways to access that mental image. If they were making something up, they might stare more or look down, but this feels like the opposite. The head tilting and side-turning also seem natural, like they're just engaged in the conversation, not trying to hide anything. 

On the other hand, I can see why someone might think it's deception. The raised eyebrows and exaggerated mouth movement *do* look a bit forced, like they're overcompensating—maybe they're tense about the question and trying too hard to seem calm. And the lack of smiling or laughing when they're talking about something that might be personal could feel off to some people. But honestly, that could just be their default expression; not everyone smiles when they're speaking, especially if they're thoughtful. 

The thing is, humans are really bad at spotting lies through behavior alone. We often mistake nervousness for dishonesty, but nervousness can come from a lot of things—maybe they're just stressed about the situation, not lying. I don't see any clear "red flags" like frequent blinking, frowning, or avoiding the person's eyes entirely. If anything, the gaze shifts and head movements seem more like someone trying to remember or process what they're saying, which feels more truthful to me. But I'm not 100% sure—maybe I'm just overthinking it. It's possible they're lying, but the cues here don't strongly point that way. Honestly, I'd need more context or to hear what they're actually saying to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'd hesitate to call it a solid "no lie" because body language is so subjective.

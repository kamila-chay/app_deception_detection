Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. The person in the video seems to be looking down quite a bit—like, they're not making eye contact with whoever they're talking to, and their gaze is consistently directed downward. That's the most noticeable thing. At first glance, I'd probably think, "Hmm, avoiding eye contact? Maybe they're hiding something." But then I started second-guessing because... well, it's not like they're fidgeting or sweating or anything. They're just sitting there, quiet, eyes down. No nervous ticks, no exaggerated gestures, no weird pauses where they seem to be searching for words. In fact, they seem pretty calm overall.

I know a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact, but I've heard it's not that simple. Sometimes people look down because they're shy, or they're genuinely thinking about what they're saying, or maybe they're just not used to being on camera. Like, maybe they're just uncomfortable in the situation, not necessarily lying. I've seen people look down when they're being honest about something hard—like admitting a mistake or sharing a personal story. It could also be that the lighting or the setup makes it hard for them to see the camera clearly, so they're just naturally looking at their lap or the table. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, it's kind of odd they wouldn't show *any* other signs. Usually, when people lie, they might blink more, touch their face, or seem stiff. But here, they're just... still. No big reactions. So it feels like the lack of other cues might actually point to them being truthful. Like, if they were faking it, I'd expect more nervous energy. But maybe they're just really good at hiding it? I don't know. 

Honestly, I'm not sure. The downcast gaze is the only thing that stands out, and it's not enough on its own to say "definitely lying." It could just be their natural way of speaking. I'd lean toward them telling the truth because they don't seem stressed or defensive, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're not lying—but I'm definitely not 100% sure. It's one of those cases where the behavior just doesn't scream "deception" to me.

From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty calm while speaking—they're consistently looking at the camera (what I'd call "gaze towards interlocutor" in the description), which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. They don't seem fidgety or overly tense; no nervous blinking, no awkward pauses where their mouth's shut like they're struggling for words. Actually, the fact that they're looking down sometimes while talking—like when they're thinking or emphasizing a point—doesn't strike me as suspicious. I've seen a lot of people do that when they're being truthful, especially if they're just speaking thoughtfully, not trying to hide something.  

That said, I guess you could argue the downward gaze *is* a red flag for some people—like if they're avoiding eye contact to seem guilty. But honestly, I've learned that avoiding eye contact isn't a reliable lie detector; some truth-tellers look away when they're concentrating, and some liars will stare you down to seem confident. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" stuff like covering their mouth or rubbing their hands, which makes me lean away from thinking they're hiding something.  

Still, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're just really composed, or maybe they're a good liar who doesn't show physical signs. But based on what I'm seeing—steady eye contact, no fidgeting, just natural pauses—it feels like they're being genuine. It doesn't *feel* like they're lying, but I'd want more context to be certain, like what they're actually talking about. For now, though, the calmness of it seems to point more toward truth than deception.

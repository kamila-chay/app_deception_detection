Hmm, looking at this clip, it's actually a bit tricky to call. The person's behavior feels... conflicted in a way that makes it hard to pin down. They're nodding along while also shaking their head, which immediately throws me off—usually, those gestures don't happen together unless someone's trying to say "sort of" or "I'm not sure." And they're got their arms folded the whole time, which often reads as defensive or closed-off, but they're also maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually suggests honesty. 

That raised eyebrows and frequent blinking stand out too—they could just be nervous, like maybe they're rehearsing what they're saying or genuinely surprised by the question. But I've seen people do that when they're lying, so I can't rule it out. The lips protruding is interesting though; that's usually a sign of skepticism or disagreement, like they're mentally pushing back on something. But they're not smiling or frowning, so it's not overtly negative. 

On the flip side, the sideways glance feels like it might be a red herring—it could just mean they're thinking, not necessarily avoiding truth. And the head tilting? That's often just curiosity, not deception. I keep circling back to the arms folded and the nodding: if they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they're actually looking at the person talking to them most of the time. Maybe the folded arms are just their default posture when they're concentrating, not a shield. 

The counterargument is strong though—people lie all the time while looking you in the eye, and the mixed head gestures *do* feel like they're trying to manage two conflicting things. But then again, I've seen people act exactly like this when they're just tired or overwhelmed, not lying. Honestly, the most consistent thing is that they're not doing the classic "tells"—no lip biting, no excessive hand movements, no obvious avoidance. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd lean toward them being truthful, but it's not a slam dunk. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the actual conversation to know if the words match the cues. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd be really hesitant to bet on it without more context.

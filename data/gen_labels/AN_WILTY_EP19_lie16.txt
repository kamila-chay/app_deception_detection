Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit tricky. They're definitely looking directly at the camera the whole time, which usually feels like someone trying to be open or honest, not avoiding eye contact like you might expect from a liar. But their eyes are mostly looking up, not down or sideways, which I've heard people say sometimes happens when someone's trying to recall or make up a story. Like, if they're thinking of something they didn't actually experience, they might glance up to "construct" it in their head. 

On the flip side, though, they're not showing any of the classic nervous tells—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses where their mouth stays shut, no raised eyebrows or lip movements that seem forced. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a little more tense, but they seem pretty relaxed. Maybe they're just a naturally calm person, or maybe they're really good at hiding it. I've read that some people don't show physical signs of deception at all, especially if they're practiced or not stressed about getting caught. 

Honestly, the lack of obvious signs makes me lean toward them telling the truth, but that gaze up is nagging at me. It could just be how they think—like when you're trying to remember a detail, you look up, and that's totally normal. Without knowing what they're saying, it's hard to tell if the story itself makes sense or if it's just a coincidence. I wouldn't bet money on it either way, but if I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're being truthful, though I'm not 100% convinced. It's one of those moments where behavior alone doesn't tell the whole story.

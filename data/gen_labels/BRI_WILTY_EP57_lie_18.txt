Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure, but here's what I'm noticing. They seem to be avoiding direct eye contact a lot—like, their gaze keeps sliding sideways instead of staying on the person they're talking to, and their head is kind of tilting away or moving back a bit when they answer. I've seen people do that when they're trying not to be caught in a lie, like they're physically creating distance. Also, their chin is actually moving downward a few times while they're speaking—almost like they're pulling it in, which I've heard can signal discomfort or defensiveness. It feels like they're not fully engaged with the conversation, which makes me lean toward deception.  

But wait, I should be careful not to jump to conclusions. Maybe they're just really nervous about being recorded or the topic is awkward for them, not necessarily lying. Some people naturally look away when they're thinking hard, or maybe they're from a culture where direct eye contact isn't the norm. And honestly, their head movements could just be a habit—they might do that all the time when they're speaking, even when they're telling the truth. I've known people who tilt their head and shift their body like that when they're just trying to remember something, not when they're hiding something.  

The thing that keeps me second-guessing is that they don't seem to have any of the classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact completely, or over-explaining. They're not smiling or laughing in a way that feels forced, and their voice (though I can't hear it here) probably doesn't have that shaky tone. But the sideways glance and the chin thing... those stand out a bit more than the usual stuff. Still, I'm not 100% sure. It could be a mix of nerves and deception, or just nerves alone. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say *maybe* deception, but I'd definitely want more context—like what they're being asked about or if they've been consistent before. It's easy to misread body language, so I'd hesitate to call it a lie outright. I'd say it's a maybe, leaning toward deception, but I wouldn't bet on it.

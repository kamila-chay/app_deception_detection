Watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that this person might be lying, although I can't say for certain. Their avoidance of direct eye contact—constantly looking sideways rather than maintaining focus—combined with the way their head tilts away or moves back when responding, suggests a subtle attempt to distance themselves physically from the conversation. The downward movement of their chin a few times feels like a sign of discomfort or defensiveness, which could indicate they’re not being entirely truthful. They don’t seem fully engaged, which adds to my suspicion.

However, I also recognize that these behaviors could stem from nervousness or cultural habits rather than deception. Maybe they’re just uneasy about being recorded or find the topic awkward, and some people naturally look away when they're thinking deeply. The head movements could simply be habitual rather than indicative of dishonesty. They don’t exhibit classic signs like extreme fidgeting, outright avoidance of eye contact, or forced expressions, which complicates things.

Still, those sideways glances and chin movements stand out enough that I find it reasonable to lean toward the possibility of deception. It’s not definitive by any means, and I’d definitely want more context or consistency to draw a stronger conclusion. Overall, I’d say they are probably not telling the whole truth, though I wouldn’t be confident enough to state it outright.

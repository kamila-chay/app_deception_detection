Hmm, this is tricky—I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful based on what I'm seeing. The first thing that stands out is how often they're blinking. Like, *really* frequently, almost like they're trying to avoid looking directly at the camera or the person they're talking to. That's the thing that makes me pause—people often blink more when they're stressed or trying to hold something back, but it could also just be dry eyes or they're in a bright room. I keep thinking, "Is this nervousness or something else?"

Then there's the way they're looking. They're definitely making eye contact with the person they're speaking to (gaze towards interlocutor is true), which is interesting because I always hear people say liars avoid eye contact. But they're also glancing sideways a lot, and tilting their head. Head tilting can be a sign of engagement or curiosity, though—like they're really listening or processing what they're saying. So that part doesn't scream "lying" to me. It almost feels like they're trying to seem attentive, which might actually be a red herring.

I'm also noticing they're not smiling or frowning, and their mouth stays pretty neutral. No big exaggerated gestures or hands moving around, which sometimes people do when they're lying. But then again, not all liars act that way—some people just get quiet and still. The sideways glances make me wonder if they're trying to remember something or if they're distracted, not necessarily hiding something. Like, maybe they're just thinking hard about their answer.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the frequent blinking and sideways glances might be their body's way of signaling discomfort, even if they're trying to keep eye contact. But I'm not convinced because it's so easy to misread nervousness as deception. Maybe they're just tired, or the lighting is weird, or they're naturally a fast-blinker. I've seen people who blink like that all the time and they're totally honest.

Honestly, I'm leaning a little toward deception because of the blinking and the sideways glances—those feel a bit off for a straightforward conversation—but I'm really not sure. It could just be them being a bit awkward or distracted. The direct eye contact is confusing me because it doesn't match the "liar avoids eyes" stereotype. I'd need more context, like what they're talking about or if they're consistent in their behavior, to feel confident. Right now, I'm just guessing. It's hard to tell if this is just someone being a little nervous or if there's something more going on. I'd say it's possible they're not being fully truthful, but I wouldn't bet on it based on this alone.

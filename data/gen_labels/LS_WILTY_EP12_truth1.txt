From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty composed while speaking. They’re not smiling or laughing, which might make someone think they’re hiding something, but I’ve noticed that truth-tellers often don’t smile during serious conversations—especially if they’re recalling details carefully. What stands out more is how they’re holding their mouth closed with these little awkward pauses, like they’re really thinking before they speak. Their eyebrows are raised a couple times, which feels like natural emphasis or surprise, not the kind of "deer in headlights" look I’d expect if they were lying. And they’re nodding along while talking, which usually means they’re engaged and confident in what they’re saying.  

The way they keep their gaze down, not looking away or up like someone might if they were fabricating something, also feels like they’re focused on remembering details—kinda like how people look down when they’re trying to recall a memory. Their head’s tilted a bit too, which seems relaxed, not forced. The chin moving up and down? That’s a bit odd, but it could just be a nervous habit or subtle head movement while talking, not necessarily a sign of deception.  

But I’d be lying if I said it’s 100% clear. Sometimes people who lie *do* stay calm and avoid eye contact—gaze down isn’t always a truth-teller thing, and those awkward pauses could just be them being nervous, whether they’re lying or not. I’ve seen people who lie with zero fidgeting, so the lack of obvious tells doesn’t *prove* they’re truthful. It’s also possible they’re just really good at hiding it, or maybe they’re not lying but they’re stressed about the topic.  

Still, all the cues I’m seeing—no scowling, no lip biting, no hands fidgeting—lean more toward them being genuine. It’s not the textbook "lie" behavior, and the way they’re speaking feels measured and natural, not rehearsed. I’d lean toward truth, but honestly, without knowing the context of what they’re saying, I can’t be sure. It’s one of those cases where the behavior fits the truth better than the lie, but it’s not a slam dunk. Like, it *could* still be a lie, but it doesn’t *feel* like it.

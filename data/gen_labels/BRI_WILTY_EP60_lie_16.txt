Okay, so I watched the clip a couple times, and honestly? I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty calm on the surface, which is interesting because I usually expect more nervous ticks when someone's lying—like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. But here, they're actually looking right at the person asking the questions the whole time, which feels a bit off if they were trying to hide something. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect them to glance away more, but they're locked in with steady eye contact. That makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not confident.

On the flip side, they've got this tight frown the whole time—eyebrows knitted together, not smiling at all. I know people often frown when they're stressed or disagreeing, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just frustrated with the question, or genuinely upset about whatever they're talking about. Like, if someone asked me a question I didn't like, I might frown too, and that wouldn't mean I'm lying. So that frown could be a red herring. 

Also, no weird blinking, no hands moving around, no awkward pauses—they seem pretty composed. That’s the weird part. If they were lying, I’d expect *some* physical cue, right? But they’re just... sitting there, frowning, but not doing anything else. It’s almost like they’re too calm, which sometimes happens when people are practiced at lying, but it’s also possible they’re just not nervous. I mean, maybe they’re telling the truth about something they’re actually confident about. 

The thing is, I can’t rule out deception entirely. Maybe they’re suppressing their nervousness, or the frown is a subconscious sign they’re uncomfortable with the truth. But honestly, the steady eye contact feels more like truth-telling to me—most people who lie look away more, even if they’re trying not to. So I’m leaning toward them being honest, but I’d need more context to be sure. Like, what’s the actual question they’re answering? If it’s something super personal, the frown might just be them processing a hard answer, not lying. Yeah, I think I’d say they’re probably telling the truth, but I’m not 100% because it’s really ambiguous. It’s easy to misread that frown as deception when it might just be... well, being human.

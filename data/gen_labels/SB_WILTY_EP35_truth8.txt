Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. They seem pretty engaged while talking—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're speaking to, which usually feels like a good sign for honesty. They're nodding along too, like they're actively listening or agreeing, and their head movements are smooth, not jerky or overly tense. That "chin moving upwards" thing they're doing—almost like they're holding their head steady with some confidence—doesn't scream "lying" to me. In fact, when people are being truthful, they often keep their head more stable and upright, not darting around.

But then there's that frown they keep giving, eyebrows pulled down a bit. At first glance, that could feel like a red flag—like they're stressed or hiding something. I've seen people frown when they're thinking hard about a tricky question, though, not necessarily when they're lying. Maybe they're just processing what they're saying, or the topic is making them uncomfortable for reasons unrelated to deception. And that sideways glance they have now and then? It's subtle, but people do that sometimes when they're gathering their thoughts, not just when they're being dishonest. I mean, I've caught myself doing that when I'm trying to remember a detail, so it doesn't *have* to mean they're making it up.

On the flip side, if they were lying, you'd probably expect more obvious signs—like avoiding eye contact entirely, fidgeting, or that stiff "mouth closed" look that makes people seem guarded. But here, they're not doing any of that. Their hands are still, they're not covering their face or rubbing their neck, and they're actually leaning in a bit (head moving backward might look like that). It all feels... calm, in a way. Like they're just speaking plainly, even if they're a little tense. 

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The frown and the sideways glance make me pause for a second, but the consistent eye contact and natural head movements feel more aligned with someone who's being straightforward. It’s easy to overthink these things—like, we all know people lie without looking like they're lying—but this just doesn't have that "tell" vibe I've seen in other clips. Maybe they're just a bit nervous about the subject, not the truth. So, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It’s one of those situations where the behavior is just... neutral enough that it’s hard to call.

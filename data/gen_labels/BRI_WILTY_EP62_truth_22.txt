Looking at the clip, the person is smiling pretty consistently while speaking, and they don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding eye contact in a way that stands out—wait, actually, they're not looking directly at the person they're talking to, which is a bit odd. But they're smiling, and there's no nervous energy like rapid blinking or shifting around. Most of the time when people lie, they seem tense—like they're hiding something—but here, they just seem... calm? Or maybe just comfortable. The smile looks natural, not forced, and they're not pausing awkwardly or covering their mouth. 

But then I wonder: could they be *too* calm? Like, maybe they're practiced at lying and don't show stress. Some people can keep it together even when they're not telling the truth. And the lack of eye contact *does* make me pause—usually, liars avoid looking at you, but maybe they're just shy or distracted. I've seen people smile while lying, especially if they're trying to seem friendly. Like, "Oh, this is no big deal!" kind of smile. 

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth, the smile makes sense—they're probably genuinely relaxed about whatever they're saying. And honestly, the absence of all those "lie tells" (no lip biting, no shaky hands, no weird head movements) feels more like someone who's not stressed about what they're saying. It's not perfect—no one's a lie detector—but it leans toward truth for me. I'm not 100% sure, though. Maybe they're just good at it. But based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like they're hiding anything.

I'm watching this clip right now and trying to figure out if the person is lying or not, but honestly, it's really tricky. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which is interesting because I've heard both that truth-tellers do that to seem sincere and that liars do it too to appear more honest. So that alone doesn't really tell me much—it could go either way. 

What stands out more is how still they are. They don't seem to be fidgeting at all—no hand movements, no shifting in their seat, nothing. I know people often say liars fidget, but I've also read that some really good liars suppress that stuff to seem calm. So this calmness might actually be a red flag, like they're trying too hard to be composed. But then again, maybe they're just naturally this relaxed? Like, if they're telling the truth about something they're not stressed about, they wouldn't need to fidget. I'm not sure if that's a sign of deception or just their normal behavior.

Another thing I notice is their hands—they have their palms up, facing the other person. I've seen that described as a sign of openness or honesty, like they're being transparent. But I've also heard that some people use that gesture when they're lying to seem innocent. So that could be either. It's not like they're hiding their hands or covering their mouth, which I'd expect to see if they were nervous about lying. But since they're not doing those things, it's hard to say.

I keep circling back to the lack of nervous energy. If they were telling the truth, I'd probably expect a little more natural movement—maybe a small gesture or a change in posture. But they're just sitting there, perfectly still. That feels a bit off to me, like it's staged. But then I think, maybe they're just a very calm person, or maybe the topic isn't even that personal. I don't have any context for what they're saying, so it's hard to judge.

Honestly, I'm torn. On one hand, the direct eye contact and open palms could point to truth. On the other, the unnatural stillness feels like they're trying to hide something. I wouldn't bet money on it, but if I had to lean toward something, I'd say... maybe they're lying? But I'm not confident at all. It's the kind of thing where without more context, it's really hard to tell. I'd want to hear what they're actually saying before I'd feel sure.

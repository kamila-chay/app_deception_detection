Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though it's tricky. The way they're holding steady eye contact with the person they're talking to feels like they're engaged and trying to be sincere, which usually doesn't line up with someone who's lying (since liars often avoid eye contact to feel less exposed). Their head is tilted slightly, which usually reads as curiosity or active listening—not something I'd expect from someone fabricating a story. And they're not doing any of the classic nervous tells: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles or weird blinking. That lack of stress signals actually makes me think they're not lying, because lying often triggers those little physical reactions.

But I can see why someone might think otherwise. That downward chin movement is a bit odd—it looks like they're subtly shaking their head "no" or hesitating, which sometimes happens when people are being evasive. And the raised eyebrows could come off as suspicious, like they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical to cover up something. If I were really trying to catch a lie, I'd wonder if they're overcompensating—like they're *so* focused on seeming honest that they're doing little gestures that feel unnatural. But honestly, that chin thing still feels more like a natural habit than a sign of deceit to me. Most people who lie don't look this calm while doing it. I'd probably say they're being truthful, but I'm not 100% confident—there's always room for misreading body language, especially when it's subtle. It just doesn't *feel* like deception to me.

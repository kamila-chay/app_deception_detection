Honestly, while some aspects of their behavior suggest truthfulness, I'm leaning toward the possibility that they might be lying. The steady eye contact and slight head tilt could indicate engagement, but these cues can also be consciously controlled to appear sincere. The absence of typical nervous tells doesn’t necessarily rule out deception, as some people are skilled at hiding these signs. The downward chin movement and subtle head shake, combined with raised eyebrows, seem a bit off and might reflect hesitation or an attempt to mask discomfort. These subtle gestures could be overcompensation to appear honest, which sometimes happens when someone is fabricating. Though it’s not definitive, these mixed signals make me lean slightly toward thinking they might be deceptive, even if it’s not entirely clear-cut.

Based on the cues present, I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive, though I can't say for certain. Their laugh, while clearly present, comes off as somewhat forced and doesn't fully match the tone of the conversation—it seems a bit rehearsed rather than spontaneous. The pronounced eyebrow raise also feels slightly off, as if they're trying too hard to appear surprised or engaged, which doesn't come across as entirely natural. Moreover, the person's stillness and steady eye contact, while usually signs of comfort, seem almost too controlled in this context, which can sometimes indicate an attempt to mask nervousness or a falsehood. Although some people naturally maintain calm and steady eye contact even when truthful, here it feels more like a careful performance rather than genuine ease. The combination of these subtle mismatches—the laugh, the expression, and the composed demeanor—makes me suspect that they might not be fully truthful. It's not definitive, and there remains ambiguity, but overall, I lean toward the possibility that the person is not being entirely honest.

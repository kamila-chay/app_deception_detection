Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. The person seems pretty calm overall, no obvious signs like fidgeting or forced smiles that I'd usually associate with lying. They're actually making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which is interesting because sometimes liars avoid direct gaze, but not always. What stands out is that they keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really noticeable—while they're speaking. And their eyes keep drifting sideways a bit, not straight at the person, which feels a little off. 

On one hand, those raised eyebrows and sideways glances could be signs they're stressed or trying to seem more engaging while they're thinking, which might point to deception. But honestly, people raise their eyebrows naturally when they're concentrating or trying to sound convincing, even when they're telling the truth. And that sideways glance? Maybe they're just looking at something behind the camera or they're used to glancing away when they're processing thoughts, not necessarily hiding something. 

Also, they don't seem nervous in other ways—no rapid blinking, no lip biting, no awkward pauses where they're trying to fill silence. They're speaking smoothly, and their posture is relaxed. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic stress cues, but they're mostly absent. It's possible they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're genuinely unsure about what they're saying but not deliberately deceiving. 

I'm leaning a little toward "not lying" because the lack of other physical tells feels more consistent with truthfulness, but that eyebrow thing is nagging at me. It's really hard to say for sure though—without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's almost impossible to tell. I'd need to hear the actual words to feel more confident. So yeah, I'm not entirely sure, but I'd guess they're probably telling the truth, just a bit nervous or expressive. But I could easily be wrong—people are complicated.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, they seem pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no shifting eyes or looking away, which often happens when people are hiding something. They're also nodding along like they're actively listening or agreeing, and their palms are facing up, which usually signals openness or honesty in body language. I don't see any fidgeting, awkward pauses, or nervous tells like touching their face or blinking a lot. Honestly, it feels like they're being straightforward, especially since their body language is so relaxed and aligned with what I'd expect from someone telling the truth.

But then again, I've heard that some people who lie *deliberately* mimic these "truthful" cues to seem more convincing—like keeping eye contact or using open palms to appear trustworthy. Maybe they're practiced at this or just naturally expressive. It's also possible the context matters: if they're rehearsed or in a high-pressure situation, they might suppress nervous habits even if they're lying. I'm not 100% sure though, because absence of "deception cues" doesn't *guarantee* truthfulness—some liars are really good at controlling their reactions. Still, compared to other clips I've seen where people avoid eye contact or fidget constantly, this feels more like genuine engagement. I'd lean toward them being honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's always room for doubt with human behavior.

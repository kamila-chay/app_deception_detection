Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. Right off the bat, I notice they're raising their eyebrows a lot—like, consistently throughout the conversation. It's not a quick flicker; it's more like they're holding that expression while they talk, which feels a bit unnatural to me. At the same time, they're keeping their gaze mostly on the person they're speaking to, but there's this subtle sideways glance happening too—like their eyes drift just slightly to the side while still seeming to face the other person. That combination sticks out to me because it’s not the typical "avoiding eye contact" sign of lying, but it also doesn't feel like relaxed, confident conversation. 

On one hand, the steady eye contact could actually suggest they're trying to seem sincere—some people do that when they're lying, to avoid looking guilty. And the raised eyebrows might just be them reacting to something in the conversation, like surprise or emphasis, not necessarily deception. I've seen people do that all the time without it meaning anything shady. Plus, they're not fidgeting, not smiling unnaturally, not avoiding eye contact completely—those are usually bigger red flags for me, so the absence of those might mean they're just calm or practiced. 

But then there's that sideways gaze. It feels a bit like they're checking the room or rehearsing their words, like they're not fully engaged in the moment. And the eyebrows keep going up even when the topic seems neutral—like, if they were just answering a simple question, I'd expect the expression to ease up. It's almost like they're overcompensating for something. I know deception cues aren't foolproof, but this feels like the kind of thing that might lean toward deception, especially since it's consistent. Still, I can't rule out that it's just their natural way of talking—some people have a habit of raising their brows when they're thinking, and the sideways look might just be how they process things. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward deception because of how the eyebrows and gaze work together, but I'm not sure. It could easily be a coincidence or just their personality. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're not being fully truthful, but I'd want to see more context before I'd feel confident about it. It’s not screaming "liar," but it’s enough to make me wonder.

Hmm, watching this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. On one hand, they seem to be making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—like they're trying to be open and honest. But then they keep looking down while doing it, which feels a bit off. I've heard that when people are lying, they sometimes avoid direct eye contact, but here they're *trying* to look at the other person while still glancing down. That mix makes me wonder if they're nervous or just really focused on what they're saying, not necessarily deceptive. 

Then there's the eyebrow thing—they raise them a couple of times, like when they're being asked something unexpected. That could be genuine surprise, but I've also read that people sometimes do that when they're fabricating a story to seem innocent. Still, eyebrows can just mean confusion or interest, so I'm not sure. 

On the flip side, they don't seem fidgety or avoidant—no hand movements, no obvious signs like staring at the ceiling or avoiding the question. If they were lying, I might expect more nervous energy, like touching their face or shifting in their seat. But here, they're pretty still, which could mean they're confident in their story... or just really good at hiding it. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The down-gaze and raised eyebrows *could* point to deception, but they could also just be someone who's naturally thoughtful or a bit shy. I'd lean toward them telling the truth because they're engaging directly, but I'm not confident at all. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe not lying—but I'd want to see more context to be sure. It's easy to misread these things.

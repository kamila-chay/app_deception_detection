Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though I'm not entirely certain. They do try to make eye contact, which suggests openness, but the frequent downward glances feel somewhat off—this kind of mixed eye behavior often hints at discomfort or evasion rather than straightforward honesty. The way they raise their eyebrows a few times might be an attempt to show surprise or innocence, but it could also be a subtle sign of fabricating a story. On the other hand, their lack of fidgeting or avoidance is unusual for someone who is lying, which complicates the picture. Still, it's possible they're simply skilled at managing their body language to mask nervousness. Considering these cues together, I tend to suspect they may not be fully truthful, though it’s far from definitive. More context would definitely help clarify, but as it stands, I lean slightly toward deception.

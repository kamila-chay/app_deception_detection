Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out just by watching the clip, and it's a bit tricky. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really focused on the person across from them—which usually feels like a sign of someone being engaged and truthful. But then they also glance sideways a couple of times, which makes me pause for a second. I know some people think liars avoid eye contact, but I've heard that's not always true—sometimes truth-tellers look away naturally while thinking, so that sideways glance might just be normal.  

What really stands out to me is how calm they seem. No fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no awkward pauses where they're trying to cover up. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* sign of stress—like fidgeting with their hands or looking down too much—but here, they're just sitting there, steady. Their posture feels open too, no crossed arms or tense shoulders. That makes me lean toward truth, honestly.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it. Maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show typical signs, or maybe they're just used to being in interviews and staying calm. The sideways glance could also feel a little off if it's too frequent, but it doesn't seem forced—it looks like a natural shift, like they're processing what they're saying. Honestly, though, the lack of *any* nervous tells is pretty convincing to me. If they were lying, I'd expect *something* to give it away, even if it's subtle.  

So yeah, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's hard to say for certain without more context, but based on what I'm seeing, the behavior just doesn't scream "lying" to me. It feels... natural. Like they're just answering honestly, not trying to hide anything. But I guess you could argue the sideways glances mean something, so I'm not going to claim I *know* for sure. Just what my gut says after watching it.

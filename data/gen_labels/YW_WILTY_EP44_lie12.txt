Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn on this one. On the surface, there are a few things that make me pause—like the way their eyebrows are raised and the slight sideways glance they give while answering. Those can sometimes show up when someone's trying to think of a response or feels a bit off-kilter, which *could* hint at not being fully truthful. The lip corners up too—like they're forcing a smile a little too much—but it's not a full smile, so it's hard to say if that's just nervousness or something else.

But then there's the open body language: arms relaxed and open, palms facing up like they're being transparent, and that shrug at the end feels genuine, like they're saying "I don't know" without hiding anything. Their gaze stays mostly on the person asking, which usually suggests they're trying to connect or be honest, not avoid eye contact. And honestly? I don't see the classic signs of deception here—no frowning, no frantic blinking, no covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands. Those are the things I'd usually lean toward if I thought someone was lying, so their absence feels like a stronger clue.

That said, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the sideways glance is just them looking at their notes or something, and the raised eyebrows are just a natural reaction to the question. People get nervous in interviews or videos, and that can mimic deception cues without it actually being deception. It's also possible they're being honest but just really uncomfortable with the topic, which might explain the slight tension in their expression. 

Honestly, I'd probably need more context—like what they're talking about or how they're reacting to follow-up questions—to feel confident. Right now, it feels like they're being straightforward, but I can see how someone else might read the raised eyebrows and sideways look as signs of lying. I'd lean toward truthfulness based on the open posture and lack of red flags, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's one of those cases where the behavior is just... ambiguous.

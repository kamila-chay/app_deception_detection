Looking at the clip, I'm really trying to figure this out, but honestly, it's not super clear-cut. The person seems a bit fidgety—like they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying not to make eye contact. Their gaze keeps darting sideways, and they're tilting their head and turning it a bit to the side a lot. There's also this subtle chin lift, like they're holding their head up a little higher than normal, and they're shaking their head once or twice while talking. On the surface, those little movements—especially the sideways glances and the head tilts—make me wonder if they're not being totally straightforward. I've heard that when people lie, they often avoid direct eye contact or make these small, nervous gestures, so it *could* be a sign of deception.  

But then again, I'm not sure. Maybe they're just naturally expressive or really focused on what they're saying—like they're trying to think of the right words. The blinking might just be from dry eyes or general nerves, not necessarily lying. And they *are* making eye contact sometimes (the description says "gaze towards interlocutor" is true), so it's not like they're avoiding the person entirely. If they were lying, I'd expect more consistent avoidance, not just occasional shifts. The head shaking too—I think sometimes people do that as a natural "no" or to emphasize a point, not because they're hiding something.  

Honestly, the lack of big emotional cues (no smiling, no frowning, no obvious tension) makes it even trickier. If they were really stressed about lying, you'd expect more visible signs like tight lips or forced smiles, but they seem pretty neutral. So maybe they're just being careful with their words, or maybe they're telling the truth but feeling a bit awkward. I wouldn't bet money on it either way. It feels like one of those moments where the behavior *could* point to deception, but it's just as likely to be something else entirely. If I had to guess? I'd lean toward "maybe" they're not being fully honest, but I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context to be confident.

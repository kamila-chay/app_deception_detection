Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their intense eye contact feels somewhat suspicious, especially since while liars often avoid eye contact, some deliberately maintain it to appear honest, which could be what’s happening here. What really stands out is how frequently they blinked—much more than usual—which can be a sign of stress or anxiety that sometimes accompanies lying. Although this isn’t definitive, and blinking could have other causes like tiredness or dryness, it does tilt the scales a bit toward deception in my mind. They didn’t exhibit other typical signs of dishonesty such as fidgeting or exaggerated expressions, appearing fairly calm, which adds some ambiguity. Still, the combination of the overcompensated eye contact and excessive blinking makes me suspect that they might be concealing something. While I can’t say with certainty, my impression is that they are probably not being completely honest.

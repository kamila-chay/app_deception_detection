Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure this out. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're not smiling or laughing, which I guess you'd expect if they were really comfortable, but they're also not frowning or scowling, which is a bit odd if they were lying. Their eyebrows are raised, though, which usually means surprise or skepticism, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, and they keep nodding while they talk, which feels like they're engaged. Their hands are open with palms up, which I've heard people say is a sign of being open or honest, not hiding something. 

But then there's the raised eyebrows again—I wonder if that's a sign they're trying to seem surprised or maybe even a little nervous. Sometimes people do that when they're making something up. And they're looking up a lot while talking, which I think some people say happens when you're recalling a memory, but I've also heard that liars look up too when they're fabricating stories. So that could go either way. 

The head moving forward and backward feels like they're leaning in and out, which might just be natural talking rhythm, but it's not like they're fidgeting or crossing arms, which I'd expect if they were stressed about lying. They're not touching their face or rubbing their hands, which are common nervous tells. Actually, the lack of those things makes me lean toward them being truthful—like, if they were lying, I'd expect more of those little anxious gestures. 

Still, I'm not 100% sure. Some people are really good at hiding it, and the raised eyebrows are throwing me off. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question. It's hard to say for sure just from this clip. But honestly, the calmness, the eye contact, the open hands, and no obvious nervousness make me think they're probably telling the truth. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but it feels like the "truth" label makes sense here.

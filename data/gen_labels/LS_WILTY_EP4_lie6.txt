Looking at the video, I'm inclined to think they might not be telling the whole truth. Their frequent smiling is notable—people often use smiles to appear friendly and calm when they’re actually being deceptive. While it could just be their natural expression, the fact that their smile sometimes looks a bit forced or overdone suggests they might be trying too hard to seem pleasant. Additionally, the subtle shifts in their facial expressions, like brief moments where their lips pull down as if briefly uncomfortable, could indicate some underlying tension that aligns with someone holding back or fabricating information.

Their eye contact is mostly steady, which usually signals honesty, but the occasional glances downward and sideways catch my attention. These could be signs of nervousness or discomfort, which often accompany lying, even though it’s true some people glance around when thinking or recalling information. The body language is somewhat mixed—open arms and relaxed posture typically suggest sincerity, yet these same open gestures can also be deliberately used to build trust and mask deception. The way they lightly touch their hands on the table might be an attempt to appear calm, but could equally be a subtle effort to control their nervousness.

While some elements, like the open posture, lean toward genuineness, the forced smile and uneven facial cues give me pause. Without hearing their words, it’s challenging to determine if their behavior truly matches their statements. Given these observations, I lean toward the idea that they’re probably not being entirely truthful, though I can’t say this with complete certainty. It’s one of those cases where the signs lean slightly toward deception but don’t definitively prove it.

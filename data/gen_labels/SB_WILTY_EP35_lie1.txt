Looking at the clip, I'm noticing a few things that make me lean toward them not being entirely truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. They keep looking down while talking, which I've noticed people do when they're trying to recall something or avoiding eye contact—though they do still glance up at the person they're talking to sometimes, which is a bit confusing. There's also this odd thing where their mouth stays closed a lot, and they have these little awkward pauses in their speech, like they're struggling to find the right words. I've seen that happen when someone's trying to piece together a story, not when they're just being honest. And their lips are pushed out a bit, like they're tensing them to hold something back, and their chin juts up a little when they talk—kind of like they're bracing themselves.

But then, I'm also thinking maybe I'm reading too much into it. They're not avoiding eye contact entirely, which is often a bigger red flag for lying, and they're not fidgeting or laughing nervously like I'd expect. Maybe they're just shy or really focused on what they're saying, and the pauses are just them thinking carefully. I've known people who talk like that when they're being honest but just aren't great at speaking off the cuff. The head turning sideways a bit could just be a natural gesture, not necessarily a sign of deception. Honestly, it's a toss-up—I'd say there's a decent chance they're not being fully truthful because of the pauses and the way they're holding their mouth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like they're hiding something, but it's also possible they're just really uncomfortable in the moment. I'd need more context to be sure.

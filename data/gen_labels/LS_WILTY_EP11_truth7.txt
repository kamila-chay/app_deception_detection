Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if this person is lying or not—it's kind of tricky. They're definitely showing some subtle tension, like their lips are pulled down a bit and kind of pushed out, which often happens when someone's uncomfortable or stressed, and they're raising their eyebrows a little while looking slightly sideways. That sideways glance makes me think they might be trying to avoid direct eye contact, which sometimes happens when people are being deceptive. But honestly, I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking or feeling awkward about a topic, not necessarily lying.  

On the other hand, they're not doing any of the classic "lying" stuff—no frantic blinking, no covering their mouth, no fidgeting with their hands, and their head isn't shaking or bobbing like it might if they were nervous. The head tilting and side-turning actually seem kind of relaxed, like they're just engaged in the conversation, not trying to hide something. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs of tension, like their jaw tightening or avoiding eye contact completely (like looking down or away for long stretches), but here it's just a brief sideways glance and those subtle lip movements.  

I guess the thing that makes me lean toward "truth" is how minimal the stress cues are. If they were making something up, the nervousness usually shows up more strongly—like darting eyes or stiff posture. Here, it feels more like they're just a little uncomfortable or hesitant about what they're saying, which happens to everyone when talking about something personal or unexpected. But I'm not 100% sure—maybe they're really good at hiding it, or maybe they're genuinely upset about the topic, not lying. It’s hard to tell without knowing the context, and I’d be hesitant to call it a lie based on this alone. To me, it reads more like someone being honest but a bit uneasy, not someone trying to deceive. But yeah, I’m not ruling out the other possibility either—it’s just not jumping out at me as deception.

Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I can totally see why someone might question it. They're smiling, which feels natural, not forced, and they're not doing any of the classic "nervous liar" stuff like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact completely, or making awkward pauses. The fact that they're not scratching their head or touching their face at all makes me think they're relaxed, which usually goes with being truthful. But here's where it gets tricky: their gaze is mostly down and sideways, not directly at whoever they're talking to. That *could* be a sign they're uncomfortable or hiding something, right? Like, people often look away when they're lying to avoid being caught. But honestly, I've seen so many people—especially in casual conversations—just naturally look down or to the side when they're thinking or just not a super eye-contact person. It doesn't *feel* like a deliberate evasion to me. And their eyebrows are raised, which is a bit odd—maybe they're reacting to something in the conversation, like surprise or confusion, not necessarily deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in their face or body, but it all seems pretty calm. Still, I'm not ruling out the possibility they're lying—maybe they're just really good at hiding it. But given what I see, the lack of obvious stress cues makes me think they're probably being honest. It’s not a slam dunk, though. Like, if I had more context—like what they were even talking about—I’d feel more sure. But based on the video alone? I’d say truth, but with a shrug.

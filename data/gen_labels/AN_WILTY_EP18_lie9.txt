Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn because the person seems pretty composed overall. They're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to (which feels like they're trying to be engaged), and they're nodding along while tilting their head—those are both things people do when they're genuinely listening or agreeing. The fact that they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact at all stands out. I've noticed that when people lie, they often have more nervous tells like fidgeting, avoiding gaze, or overcompensating with smiles, but here they're just... steady. 

That said, the upward gaze is making me second-guess. I've heard that when people look up while speaking, it can sometimes be a sign they're constructing a story (like recalling or making something up), which is a classic deception cue. But I also know that upward gaze isn't always about lying—it could just mean they're thinking hard about what they're saying, which happens when people are being truthful too. Like, if they're trying to remember a detail, they might look up, and that doesn't mean they're lying. 

The head tilting and nodding also feel natural—like they're really in the conversation—not forced or rehearsed. If they were lying, I'd expect more of an effort to seem convincing, like overdoing the nods or smiling, but they're just... talking normally. The absence of any "tells" like lip biting, excessive blinking, or shifting in their seat makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're just a really calm person, or maybe they're an experienced liar who doesn't show physical signs. Honestly, it's tricky. I'd need more context—like what they're talking about—to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward truth because the behavior feels consistent with someone being engaged and calm, but I can see how someone else might read the upward gaze as suspicious. It's not a clear "lie," but it's not a clear "truth" either. I'd say it's probably honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

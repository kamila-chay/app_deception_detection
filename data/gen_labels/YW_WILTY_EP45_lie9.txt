Hmm, this is tricky. So I'm watching this clip, and the person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiles that I'd usually associate with lying. They're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I know that's not always true. Sometimes they'll overcompensate and stare too hard. Here, they're nodding a lot, which feels natural—like they're genuinely engaging in the conversation, not trying to seem convincing.  

But then there's the gaze shifting: they keep looking up and down a bit, not sideways or away. I'm not sure if that's just them thinking or trying to recall something. Some research says people look up when constructing lies, but others say it's just how people process information, whether they're lying or not. And they're not touching their face or fidgeting at all—no lip biting, no hand rubbing—which usually makes me lean toward truthfulness because liars often have nervous habits.  

On the flip side, though, the fact that they're so steady might actually be suspicious. If they were lying, they could be really practiced at hiding it, right? Like, someone who's used to lying might not show those classic signs. Or maybe they're just really good at staying calm. I also wonder if the nodding is too consistent—like, maybe they're nodding to seem agreeable even when they're not, but it doesn't feel fake to me.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The lack of nervous tells points to truth, but the gaze shifts and the fact that they're not showing any "natural" hesitation (like awkward pauses) makes me question if they're just too rehearsed. I'd lean toward them telling the truth because it seems effortless, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. If I had to guess without any other context, I'd say probably truthful, but it's really hard to say for sure. Maybe it's just a calm person answering a straightforward question.

This is a bit complicated. While the person appears calm and there are no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiles typically linked to lying, some subtle cues give me pause. They maintain steady eye contact and nod frequently, which initially suggests genuine engagement. However, their gaze shifts—looking up and down rather than sideways or away—could indicate they are trying to construct or recall information, which is something associated with deception in some studies, though it's not definitive.

The absence of nervous habits like face touching or lip biting might usually point to truthfulness, but it could also mean that the person is very practiced at concealing lies. Their consistent nodding might be an attempt to appear agreeable rather than a natural reaction. The overall steadiness and lack of hesitation might feel like confidence, but it could just as well signal a rehearsed performance.

Considering all this, I find myself leaning slightly toward the idea that they might be deceiving, though I wouldn't be completely certain. The cues don’t scream dishonesty outright, but the subtle behaviors suggest they could be masking something. Without more context, it’s hard to say definitively, but my impression tilts toward deception.

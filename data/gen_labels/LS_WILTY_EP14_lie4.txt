Looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying, but I'm leaning toward it being deceptive based on some things I noticed. The way they're smiling and raising their eyebrows feels a bit off—like they're trying too hard to seem friendly or relaxed, especially since the smile doesn't quite reach their eyes. And that exaggerated eye closing? It stood out to me; it's not something people usually do naturally, and it seemed like they were avoiding looking at the camera or the person they're talking to. Then there's the head shaking and side-tilting—it felt like they were dismissing something or trying to seem thoughtful, but it didn't match the flow of the conversation. Gaze going down a lot also makes me pause; people often look down when they're uncomfortable or trying to recall something, which could be a sign of fabrication.

But honestly, I'm not totally convinced. Smiling and raised eyebrows could just be their natural way of being engaged—some people are genuinely expressive like that, especially if they're trying to be polite or reassuring. The head shaking might just be a nervous habit, not necessarily a lie. And gaze down? I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating on what they're saying, not necessarily hiding something. It's also possible they're just tired or distracted, and the behaviors are unrelated to deception. The fact that they're not laughing or frowning makes me think it's not outright panic or anger, which could mean they're just trying to control their expression. 

All in all, the combination of the forced smile, the exaggerated eye movements, and the avoidance cues (like the gaze down and head turns) makes me think deception is a strong possibility, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. It's not a clear-cut case, though. Could easily be them just being extra animated or nervous about the situation. I'd say it's *plausible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it without hearing the conversation.

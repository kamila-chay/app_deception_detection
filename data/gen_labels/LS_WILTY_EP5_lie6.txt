Hmm, this is a bit tricky. From what I can see in the video, the person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is actually a bit unusual for someone who might be lying—people often avoid eye contact when they're being deceptive. They're also nodding along as they speak, which feels like they're engaged and agreeing with the conversation, not necessarily hiding something. But then there's that head shaking—like a slow, deliberate "no" motion while they're talking. That stands out because it seems to contradict what they're saying, like they're subtly disagreeing with themselves or the topic. I've heard that head shaking can sometimes be a nervous tic for liars, especially if they're trying to deny something without saying it outright.  

On the flip side, though, it could just be them being polite or emphasizing a point—maybe they're shaking their head to say "not quite" about something they're explaining, not necessarily lying. And the fact that they're not smiling or frowning, not blinking a lot, and keeping their mouth closed smoothly makes them seem pretty calm, which might actually point to truthfulness (since liars sometimes get fidgety). But I can't ignore that head shake—it feels like it's at odds with the rest of their calm demeanor. If they were telling the truth, why would they shake their head like that? It’s hard to say for sure without knowing the exact question they’re answering. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive, or maybe they’re trying to cover up something. Honestly, I’m leaning a bit toward deception because of that head movement, but I’d need more context to be confident. It’s definitely not a clear-cut "yes, they’re lying," but it’s the one thing that sticks out as odd.

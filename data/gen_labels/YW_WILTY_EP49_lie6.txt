Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video, honestly. At first glance, the person seems pretty open—like, they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which I'd usually associate more with someone being truthful, not deceptive. Their arms are open, palms up like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything, and they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which are things I've heard people say liars do. The subtle lip corners up feels like a neutral or maybe even genuine smile, not a forced one, and there's no sign of nervous habits like blinking a lot or touching their face. 

But then there's that head shake—like, they're shaking their head side to side. I know head shaking can mean "no," but it could also just be a natural gesture, like they're disagreeing with something they heard, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're saying "no" to a question, and it's just a normal response. I've seen people do that all the time without it being deceptive. And honestly, the absence of classic "lie signs" here makes me wonder if the deception label might be a bit off—like, maybe they're actually telling the truth, and the head shake is just part of their conversation. 

On the flip side, though, I guess you could argue that the head shake is *too* pronounced or out of context, like maybe they're shaking their head to emphasize a denial. But the video doesn't show what they're saying, so it's hard to tell if it's a natural reaction or something rehearsed. The open posture and eye contact still feel like strong indicators of honesty to me—most people who are lying tend to close off their body language or look away, not keep it so relaxed. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just based on how they're holding themselves, but I'm not 100% sure. It's possible they're a really good liar who's not showing the usual tells, or maybe the head shake is a red herring. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more confident. Without that, I'd say it feels more like they're being genuine than deceptive, but I'd still be a little hesitant—like, "Yeah, this seems truthful, but I can't rule out the head shake being a sign of something else." It's not like I'm seeing them sweat or avoid the camera, so my gut says truth, but I'd definitely want more context before I'd bet on it.

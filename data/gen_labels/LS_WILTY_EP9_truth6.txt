Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, though it's hard to say for certain just from this clip. The way they're nodding and keeping their gaze mostly directed at the person they're talking to feels engaged and natural—like they're really listening, not trying to avoid eye contact. That sideways glance they have? It could be a little odd, but it might just be how they think or gesture when they're speaking, not necessarily hiding something. And they're not doing those classic "lie signs" like frowning, lip biting, or covering their mouth—those are usually red flags if they're present, so their lack of those makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying.  

That frequent blinking and the exaggerated mouth opening though? Those are throwing me a bit. Blinking a lot can look nervous, which might make someone think they're lying, but I've seen people do that when they're just concentrating or tired, not necessarily being deceptive. The mouth thing might just be part of how they talk—like they're emphasizing words. And that chin moving up? I'm not sure if that's a sign of confidence or just how they naturally move when speaking.  

I guess the counterargument is that maybe the blinking *is* a sign of anxiety, and the sideways gaze could mean they're searching for words or avoiding the truth. But honestly, the more I watch, the less it feels like deception. Most people who are lying tend to have more obvious tension—like stiff postures or forced smiles—and this person seems relaxed overall. They're nodding along like they're in a normal conversation, not trying to sell something.  

Still, I wouldn't bet my life on it. Body language's messy, and without knowing the context—like if they're under pressure or just naturally expressive—it's easy to misread. But based on what's here, I'd say they're probably being truthful, even if the blinking is a little weird. It just doesn't *feel* like the behavior of someone hiding something.

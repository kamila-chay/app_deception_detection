Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. What stands out to me is how steady they seem—no obvious fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, and their hands are just resting open with palms up, which feels like an open gesture. They're looking directly at whoever they're talking to, not darting their eyes around or down like I've seen people do when they're nervous. Their speech also seems smooth, no awkward pauses or stammering that sometimes happens when someone's making things up. That makes me lean toward thinking they're being honest, because the classic "signs of lying" like darting eyes or closed-off body language just aren't there.

But then I start second-guessing myself—because I've heard that people who lie can actually *practice* looking calm. Maybe they rehearsed this part or just have a naturally relaxed demeanor, so the lack of nervousness doesn't really prove anything. Like, someone who's used to lying might even force eye contact to seem trustworthy, and palms up could just be a way to look innocent, not necessarily a sign of truth. And honestly, truth-tellers can be nervous too—maybe they're just really stressed about the situation, but not lying about it. The video doesn't show any of that tension, but absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.

I guess I'm stuck in the middle. The behavior *looks* like it could be truthful—steady gaze, open hands, no signs of the usual stress cues—but I can't rule out that they're just good at hiding it. It's hard to say for sure without knowing more context, like what they're saying or if they've been under pressure. So yeah, I'd say it *feels* like they're telling the truth based on what I see, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those cases where the lack of "liar signs" is more suggestive than conclusive, and I'm probably just as likely to be wrong as right.

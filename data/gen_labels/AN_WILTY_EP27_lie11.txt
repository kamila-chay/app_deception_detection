Looking at the video, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, although I can’t say that with absolute certainty. Their gaze is consistently directed downward throughout, which often raises suspicion since avoiding eye contact is commonly linked to deception. While it’s true that some people look down out of shyness, nervousness, or deep thought, the persistence of this behavior here makes me wonder if they’re deliberately avoiding direct engagement because they’re not being entirely truthful.

Their overall demeanor appears calm—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or facial tension that you might expect when someone is being deceptive. Yet, this calmness could just as easily indicate they are practiced at hiding their emotions or have rehearsed their responses. The absence of typical “tells” doesn’t necessarily imply honesty; it simply means the usual red flags aren’t visible, which can happen when someone is skilled at deception.

I also consider that their downward gaze might be a way to process a difficult or uncomfortable question, but without other indicators of genuine discomfort or stress, it leaves room for doubt. The lack of lip biting or tightening further complicates the assessment—it neither strongly supports nor opposes the idea of lying. Given these mixed signals, the steady avoidance of eye contact feels more like a deliberate behavior than just a natural habit.

Overall, I’m inclined to suspect that there may be some deceit involved here, even if I can’t be definitively sure. The video suggests a possibility of deception primarily because of the persistent downcast gaze combined with a controlled, calm exterior, which together can be typical signs of someone trying to conceal the truth. While I hesitate to be definitive, I lean toward the conclusion that the person is probably not being completely honest.

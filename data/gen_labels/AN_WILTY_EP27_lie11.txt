Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. The thing that stands out most is that they keep looking down—like, their gaze is directed downward the whole time instead of meeting the camera or the person they're talking to. At first glance, that *does* make me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact because they're lying, since that's a common thing people associate with deception. But then I remember that not everyone who avoids eye contact is lying—they might just be shy, uncomfortable, or even deeply focused on what they're saying. I've seen a lot of people who are totally honest but naturally look down when they're thinking or feeling nervous, not because they're hiding something.

On the other hand, the rest of their behavior seems... calm. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck, no raised eyebrows or tense jaw. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* sign of stress—like fiddling with their hands or blinking a lot—but there's nothing like that here. It's almost like they're relaxed, which makes me think maybe they're just being straightforward. But wait, that could also mean they're really good at hiding it, right? Some people who lie practice so much they don't show any physical tells. So the lack of obvious signs doesn't *prove* they're truthful—it just means I can't spot the usual red flags.

I'm also thinking about why they might look down. Maybe the question was personal or awkward, and they're just processing it quietly. Or maybe they're used to speaking that way in their daily life. I don't see any lip movements, like biting them or tightening, which sometimes happens when people are stressed. The absence of those things makes me lean toward them being honest, but I can't be sure. It's really hard to tell from just one thing—gaze direction—without more context. Like, if they were answering a simple question and kept looking down, it might be normal. But if they were denying something major and still looked down without any other cues, that *could* be suspicious. 

Honestly, I'm not confident either way. It feels like a maybe, but I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear the content of what they're saying before I'd feel comfortable guessing. For now, the downcast gaze is the only thing jumping out, and without other signs, I'm not sure it's enough to call it deception. It might just be their natural way of speaking. I'd say I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to say "definitely" because the video alone doesn't give me enough to go on. If I had to guess, I'd say "truthful" but with a lot of "maybe" attached.

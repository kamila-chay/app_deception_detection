Based on the video, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. They maintain steady eye contact, which often suggests honesty since people who are deceptive tend to avoid it. However, their repeated head shaking—like a consistent "no" or denial—strikes me as unusual. This kind of persistent gesture could be a nervous tic, especially if they’re trying to deny something they’re actually guilty of. Normally, if someone is just disagreeing, they wouldn’t shake their head so deliberately while holding eye contact.

That said, it could also be a natural way for them to express disagreement or correct a misunderstanding, so I can’t completely rule out innocence. Their calm demeanor—no fidgeting or avoiding eye contact—seems a bit too composed, which makes me wonder if they might be practiced at appearing truthful, even if they’re not being honest. Usually, lying brings some signs of tension, like face touching or looking away, but none of that is present here. Still, the overly calm behavior raises a red flag for me.

Without knowing what they’re actually talking about, it’s tough to say definitively. If they’re denying something significant, that persistent head shake fits a pattern of deception more than just normal conversation. So, while I wouldn’t say for sure they’re lying, I tend to lean toward thinking they might be hiding something. It’s definitely open to interpretation, but overall, the cues make me cautious about accepting their words at face value.

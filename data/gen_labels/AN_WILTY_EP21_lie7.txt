Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those tricky situations where the cues aren't pointing in one clear direction. The person is definitely making eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually makes me lean toward thinking they're being honest, since liars often avoid direct gaze. But then they're shaking their head a lot—like, repeatedly saying "no" or disagreeing with something. That part feels a bit off, because head shaking can sometimes be a nervous tic, especially if they're trying to deny something they're actually guilty of. I mean, if they were just genuinely disagreeing, they might not shake their head *so* consistently while holding eye contact.  

But here's where I get stuck: head shaking could also just be how they naturally express disagreement. Maybe they're correcting a misunderstanding or just don't want to say "yes" to a question, and it's totally innocent. And honestly, the way they're sitting—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no avoiding eye contact—seems pretty calm. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like touching their face or looking away, but they're not doing any of that. It almost feels like they're being *too* composed, which could mean they're practiced at lying, but it could also just mean they're not stressed about what they're saying.  

I guess the real question is what they're even talking about. If they're denying something they did (like "I didn't steal the keys"), the head shake might fit with deception. But if they're just saying "No, I don't think that's right," it's probably just normal conversation. Without knowing the context, it's hard to say. I'd probably lean toward thinking they're telling the truth because of the steady eye contact and lack of other nervous habits, but I'm not ruling out deception either. It's really a toss-up—maybe I'd need to hear the actual words they're saying to feel more confident. Like, is that head shake a "no" to a lie, or just "no" to a question? Without that, I'm just guessing.

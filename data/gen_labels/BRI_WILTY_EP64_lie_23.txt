Looking at the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are some weird cues that make me lean toward deception, but I could totally be wrong. They're laughing, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, but it's weird because their eyebrows are furrowed and raised at the same time, like they're confused or stressed, not happy. And they're scratching their hands a lot, which often happens when people are nervous—maybe they're trying to hide something. But honestly, it could also just be an itch, or they're laughing at something awkward in the question, and the eyebrows are just reacting to that. Like, maybe they're genuinely confused about what they're being asked, not lying. The laughter doesn't match the frown, so it feels off, but I've seen people laugh nervously without lying before. I'd say it's *possible* deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—could easily be a case of them just being flustered.

Looking closely at the clip, while it's not entirely certain, there are several odd cues that make me lean toward the possibility that they're being deceptive. Their laughter might usually suggest honesty, but combined with their furrowed and raised eyebrows, which look more like signs of confusion or stress than genuine happiness, it raises some doubts. The frequent hand scratching also stands out, as it's commonly linked to nervousness and possibly trying to hide something. Although it could simply be an itch or an awkward reaction to the question, the mismatch between the laughter and the frown feels unnatural. Given these mixed signals, it seems more likely than not that they might be concealing something, even if there’s still room for doubt that they’re just flustered or confused.

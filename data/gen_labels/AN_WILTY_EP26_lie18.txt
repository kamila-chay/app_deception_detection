Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so that usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, since liars often avoid direct eye contact. But then they keep looking down a lot, and their head is tilted sideways a few times. I've read that looking down while talking can sometimes signal discomfort or evasion, especially if it's frequent, and the sideways head tilt feels a bit like they're trying to seem casual but it's not quite landing. 

On the flip side, though, there's *nothing* that screams "lie" in the usual ways—no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no nervous blinking, no crossed arms or covering their mouth. That's actually kind of unusual because I'd expect more physical tells if they were being deceptive. Maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure, or maybe they're really good at hiding it. I've seen people who look down while they're thinking or being honest, especially if they're trying to recall details. The sideways head movement could just be a habit, not a sign of lying. 

Honestly, without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's really hard to say. If they're explaining something straightforward, the down gaze might just mean they're concentrating. But if it's a sensitive topic where they'd have a reason to lie, that combination of holding eye contact while avoiding direct gaze (looking down) feels a little off. Still, I can't rule out that it's just their normal way of speaking. I'd say it's *possible* they're not being completely truthful, but I'm not confident about it. It’s the kind of thing where I’d need more to go on before I’d feel sure either way.

After watching the clip a couple times, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. On one hand, they're looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time—no shifting eyes or avoiding contact—and their arms are wide open, which usually feels like a sign of openness or honesty. You'd think that'd mean they're being truthful, right? Like, people who're trying to hide something often cross their arms or look away. But then again, I've heard that liars sometimes *overdo* the eye contact and open posture to seem extra credible, like they're trying too hard to convince you. 

The thing is, they're not doing any of the classic nervous stuff either—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no weird facial expressions. It's almost *too* calm. If they were really lying, I'd expect them to seem a bit more tense, maybe blink a lot or touch their face. But here, they're just... steady. That makes me wonder if they've rehearsed this or if they're actually just a naturally calm person. Like, maybe they're telling the truth and they just don't get flustered easily. 

But honestly, the arms open and direct gaze combo is throwing me off. It's the opposite of what I'd expect for deception, yet deception can look so normal sometimes. I mean, if someone's good at lying, they might not even *act* like a liar. So I'm stuck between "this seems honest" and "this feels staged." I'd probably lean toward deception just because the lack of any nervousness feels a bit off for a real conversation, but I wouldn't bet on it. Like, if I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're lying, but I'm really not confident. It could just be them being relaxed. Gotta say, it's really hard to tell without knowing the context—like, what are they even talking about?—and that makes it feel even more uncertain.

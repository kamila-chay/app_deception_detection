After watching the clip a few times, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though I’m not completely sure. They maintain direct eye contact and have their arms wide open, which usually suggests honesty, since people who hide things often avoid eye contact or cross their arms. However, these behaviors can sometimes be deliberately overdone by liars trying to appear more credible. What stands out is how calm and composed they are—no signs of nervousness like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or facial twitches—almost as if they’ve rehearsed this or are intentionally controlling their demeanor. While being steady and calm could indicate truthfulness, it also raises suspicion because deceitful people might purposefully avoid nervous cues to seem convincing. That open posture and strong eye contact feel almost too perfect, which makes me think it could be a bit staged. So, while I can’t say for certain, I do tend to lean toward the possibility they’re not being entirely truthful, even though it’s challenging to be confident without more context.

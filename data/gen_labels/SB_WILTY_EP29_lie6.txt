This is a bit tricky to interpret from the video alone, but I find myself leaning towards the person possibly not being entirely truthful. They are clearly engaged in the conversation, making consistent eye contact, nodding along, and showing open body language, which are often seen as signs of honesty. However, these same behaviors can sometimes be deliberately mimicked by someone who is trying to appear credible. For instance, the eye contact might be held a bit too steadily, and the head movements could be a bit too deliberate, suggesting they might be rehearsed gestures rather than natural reactions. The seeming absence of nervous cues could also indicate a practiced effort to appear calm. While nothing in the video definitively screams "lying," these subtle signs make me lean towards the possibility that the person might be putting on a convincing performance rather than fully expressing genuine reactions. Without more context about what they’re discussing, it’s hard to be certain, but overall, I tend to suspect that deception might be at play here.

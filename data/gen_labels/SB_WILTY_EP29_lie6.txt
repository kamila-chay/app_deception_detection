Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone who's clearly engaged in a conversation—like they're actively listening and responding. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which is actually a bit interesting because a lot of people assume liars avoid eye contact, but research shows truth-tellers often do that too, especially if they're trying to be credible. They're nodding along, which feels natural for someone following the conversation, and their head is moving forward and backward like they're genuinely reacting to what's being said—like they're leaning in to understand or agree, not fidgeting nervously. Plus, their arms are wide open, which usually signals openness and comfort, not defensiveness. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" tells—no fidgeting, no touching their face, no weird blinking or avoiding gaze. That makes me lean toward them being honest, honestly.  

But... I can see why someone might think they're lying, too. Sometimes really practiced liars *do* mimic those "truthful" cues—like holding eye contact too long or nodding a little too perfectly to seem convincing. And the head movements forward/backward could maybe be a bit rehearsed, like they're trying to seem engaged on purpose. If they were lying, they might overdo the "normal" stuff to cover up. But honestly? The way their body feels in the video—like they're just *there*, present, not straining—doesn't scream "I'm faking this." The absence of stress signs (like lip biting or rapid blinking) seems more telling than the presence of the "good" ones. It's not 100% proof, but if I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd probably say they're telling the truth. Though I'd want to know more context—like what they're being asked about—because sometimes even truth-tellers get nervous about certain topics. Still, right now, the behavior just looks... calm. Like they're not hiding anything.

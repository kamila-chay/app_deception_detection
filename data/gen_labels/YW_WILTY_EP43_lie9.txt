Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, the frequent blinking stands out to me—like, they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're avoiding eye contact or just really stressed. And the head shaking? It's not subtle; they're nodding "no" pretty clearly while they're talking, which feels a bit off if they're just being honest. Sometimes people shake their heads when they're denying something, even if they're not lying, but paired with the blinking, it makes me wonder if they're trying to push back on something they're not comfortable with. The smile too—lip corners up, but it doesn't look super natural, more like a forced "I'm fine" grin, which I've noticed before when people are trying to seem calm while hiding something.

But then, I keep thinking about the counterpoints. That smile could just be them being friendly or trying to keep the mood light—people smile a lot when they're nervous, but not always because they're lying. The blinking? Could be allergies, or maybe they're just tired, not necessarily deception. And they're actually making eye contact the whole time, which is interesting because I've heard that liars sometimes avoid eye contact, but not always. The head shake might just be a habit for them, like how some people shake their head when they're thinking or disagreeing with a point, not necessarily lying about it. I don't see any other classic signs—no lip biting, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses—so it's not screaming "liar" to me.

Honestly, I'm leaning a little toward deception just because of how the blinking and head shake seem to sync up with the conversation, but I'm not sure. It could just be that they're genuinely annoyed or frustrated about the topic, which would explain the head shake and the tight smile. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're not being fully truthful, but it's not a slam dunk. Like, I wouldn't bet money on it. There's enough ambiguity that it could easily be a normal reaction to a stressful question. I'd want to see more of the context—what they're actually saying—before I'd feel confident either way. For now, I'm just gonna say it's a close call, but the signs point slightly toward deception, not because it's obvious, but because the little things add up a bit oddly.

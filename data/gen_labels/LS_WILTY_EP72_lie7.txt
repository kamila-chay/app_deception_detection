Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, honestly. I'm watching them answer a question, and they're looking directly at the person asking—like, they're not avoiding eye contact at all, which usually makes me think someone might be telling the truth, because liars often glance away. But then there's this thing with their eyebrows—they keep raising them, like really high, almost like they're trying to look surprised or innocent. And they shrug a couple of times while they're talking, which feels a bit off. Shrugs can mean "I don't know" or "it's not my fault," but when it's paired with those raised eyebrows, it kind of feels like they're overcompensating, like they're trying too hard to seem casual. 

On the other hand, I'm also noticing they don't smile or laugh at all, and there's no awkward silence or fidgeting—like, their hands are still, and they're not touching their face or anything. Those are usually signs of someone being nervous or lying, so the absence of those makes me wonder if it's actually the opposite. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're genuinely confused about the question, which would explain the shrug. I've seen people do that when they're not sure how to answer, not necessarily when they're hiding something. 

The thing that keeps sticking with me is that direct gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look down or away more often, but they're holding it the whole time. Still, people can be trained to maintain eye contact while lying, so that's not a guarantee. And the raised eyebrows... I'm not 100% sure if that's a sign of deception or just their normal reaction. It's really hard to say without knowing the context of what they're talking about. Like, maybe they're discussing something they're uncomfortable with, and that's why they're doing those things, not because they're lying. 

Honestly, I'm leaning a little toward them being truthful just because of the eye contact and lack of other nervous gestures, but the eyebrows and shrug are throwing me off. It's one of those cases where it feels like they're trying to seem innocent, but I can't rule out that it's just their natural way of talking. I'd need more context to be sure—like, what the question was about or how they'd usually act. But based on what I'm seeing, I'm not entirely convinced it's a lie, though I can see why someone might think it is. It's just... ambiguous.

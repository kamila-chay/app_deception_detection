Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. What stands out to me is that they're not really making eye contact with whoever they're talking to—they keep looking down, almost like they're avoiding it. And they're raising their eyebrows a few times, which feels a bit odd, like they're trying to seem surprised or maybe nervous. I've seen people do that when they're not sure how to answer, so that makes me lean a little toward thinking they might be lying. But honestly, I'm not totally sure.  

On the flip side, looking down isn't always a sign of deception—sometimes people just get shy or distracted, especially if they're thinking hard about what to say. Like, maybe they're genuinely trying to recall something, and that's why they're not meeting the person's eyes. And raising eyebrows? That could just be a natural reaction to a question, not necessarily a "tell" for lying. I've noticed friends do that when they're confused or processing info, and they're totally honest.  

Also, they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" stuff people usually expect—no fidgeting, no touching their face, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that, right? But maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not even nervous about it. It's a bit of a toss-up.  

Honestly, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive because of the gaze and the eyebrow thing, but it's not a slam dunk. I wouldn't bet money on it either way. Like, if I had to guess, I'd say "maybe," but I'd want to see more context—like what the conversation was about or how they act normally. It's just not clear enough to call it a definite lie, but it's not a clear truth either. I'd need to hear the actual words or see more of their behavior to feel confident.

Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from watching, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person seems to be maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like a good sign for truthfulness—liars often avoid direct gaze, so that makes me lean a bit toward them being honest. But then there's this constant, almost nervous blinking they're doing, and their chin keeps moving up and down like they're subtly nodding or shifting, plus they're sticking their lips out a little. I've heard people say frequent blinking or lip protruding can be signs of stress or trying to hold back words, which sometimes happens when lying. But wait—those same things could just be their natural habit, right? Like, maybe they're just tired or have a little nervous energy, not necessarily lying. The chin movement especially—I've seen people do that when they're thinking hard or just fidgeting, not necessarily being deceptive. And they're not avoiding eye contact, which is a big red flag for lying in most cases I've observed. Gazing down occasionally might just mean they're concentrating or being humble, not hiding something. Honestly, the blinking and lip thing are making me pause, but the eye contact feels more reliable to me. I'm not 100% sure though—could easily be a nervous person who's actually telling the truth. Like, if I were in their shoes, I'd probably blink more if I was stressed about answering a question, even if I was being honest. So I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just hard to say for sure from just the video alone.

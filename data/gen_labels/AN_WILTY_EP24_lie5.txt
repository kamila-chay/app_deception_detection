Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video. I'm watching them talk, and honestly, the first thing that stands out is that they're actually making pretty consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true, so they're not avoiding looking at the person. That usually makes me lean toward truthfulness because a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact, but I know that's not always reliable. They're also nodding along while speaking, which feels like they're engaged and agreeing with their own words, not like they're fumbling for answers.  

But then there's the head shaking—side-to-side, like "no"—and the shrugs. Head shaking could mean they're denying something, which *does* sometimes happen when someone's lying, especially if they're contradicting a question. And the shrugs... that's a classic "I don't know" or "I'm not sure" gesture, which might feel like nervousness, but it's not a clear lie sign. Sometimes people shrug when they're being honest but don't have a full answer.  

The arms being open is another thing—open arms often signal honesty or openness, not defensiveness. No fidgeting, no touching their face, no awkward pauses where the mouth's closed. Those are the usual "lie" cues I'd expect to see, but they're all missing here. So maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're actually telling the truth and the head shake is just part of their reaction to the question, like "No, that's not right" without any deception.  

On the flip side, though, if they're lying, they might be doing it so smoothly that it doesn't look suspicious—some people are really good at hiding it. The head shake could be a nervous tic, or maybe they're emphasizing a denial in a way that's not obvious. I'm not 100% sure. It feels like they're being genuine, but I can't rule out that the head shake and shrug are just part of their communication style, not deception. Honestly, without more context—like what they're actually saying—it's hard to pin down. I'd probably say they seem truthful based on the absence of classic cues, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those cases where the video doesn't scream "lie," but it doesn't scream "truth" either. Just... normal, expressive behavior that could go either way.

Honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up for me. What stands out immediately is how often they're blinking—like, way more than normal. I've noticed that before when people are either really stressed or trying to think of what to say, which could go either way. If they're lying, that might be nervous energy, but if they're just answering a tough question honestly, it could just be them concentrating hard. Then there's that chin thing—like, it keeps lifting up a little, almost like they're trying to look confident or maybe even a bit defensive? But I'm not totally sure if that's a tell or just a habit. 

The eye contact part is confusing too. They're definitely looking at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But they also keep glancing down a bit, like they're not meeting the eyes directly. I've heard that some people who lie look down to avoid being caught, but others do it when they're genuinely thinking or feeling uncomfortable, even when telling the truth. It's not clear-cut. 

On the flip side, there's nothing screaming "liar" here—no fake smiles, no fidgeting with hands, no obvious signs like avoiding eye contact entirely. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic cues, but the absence of them makes me wonder if it's just them being naturally awkward or stressed. Maybe they're just bad at answering questions under pressure, not necessarily lying. 

Honestly, I'd lean toward them maybe being a bit nervous, but I can't say for sure if it's deception or just the situation. It feels like the blinking and the chin movement might point to tension, but it's so easy to misread those. If I had to guess, I'd say it's possible they're not being fully truthful, but it's really not definitive. Could easily be a normal reaction to a tricky question. I'd need more context to feel confident either way.

Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person in the video seems really still the whole time—no big gestures, no fidgeting, not even blinking much. They're just sitting there calmly, answering whatever question they're being asked with a neutral expression. At first glance, that stillness makes me wonder if they're lying because I've heard people say liars often get tense or fidgety. But then I remember that's not always true—some really good liars are super controlled, like they're rehearsed, so they don't show any signs at all. In fact, I've read that truth-tellers can sometimes look just as calm, especially if they're not emotionally invested in the topic or if they're just naturally reserved.  

On the other hand, the lack of *any* movement or expression feels a little off. Like, when people are being honest about something simple, they usually have a tiny bit of natural reaction—maybe a slight head tilt, a relaxed gesture, or even just a normal blink. Here, it's like they're frozen. That makes me lean a little toward deception, but I'm not sure. Maybe they're just really focused or in a serious mood, and not being expressive is normal for them. It's also possible they're lying but so practiced that they've mastered not showing anything.  

Honestly, I think the biggest thing is I don't have enough context. If they're answering a routine question like "What's your name?"—then the stillness is totally normal. But if it's something personal or stressful, like "Did you see the accident?"—then the lack of reaction *could* be a sign. Without knowing the situation, it's hard to say. I'd probably need to hear the actual question and their answer to feel more confident. Right now, I'm just not sure—could be truth, could be a smooth lie. I'd hesitate to call it deception based on this alone, but it's not a clear "truth" either. It's one of those cases where the absence of signs is as confusing as the presence of them.

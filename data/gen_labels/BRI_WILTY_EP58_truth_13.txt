Looking at this clip, my first impression is that the person seems engaged but a bit tense. They’re making consistent eye contact with whoever they’re talking to—which usually leans toward honesty, right? Like, when people lie, they often avoid direct gaze or fidget, but here they’re actually holding that gaze *toward* the interlocutor. That’s one point in favor of them being truthful. But then there’s that sideways glance they keep making—like they’re glancing off to the side while still looking at the person. I’ve heard some people say that sideways glances can signal thinking or even deception, but honestly, I’ve seen people do that naturally when they’re just processing what they’re saying, not necessarily lying.  

Then there’s the frowning—eyebrows knitted together. That’s tricky. It could mean they’re confused or frustrated about the question, which might happen if they’re being honest but struggling to recall something. Or maybe they’re just naturally expressive. But if they were lying, I’d expect more nervous tells—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that awkward lip thing where they keep biting their lips. None of that’s happening here. They’re not blinking a lot, not touching their face, not shifting around. The absence of those classic "lying" signs makes me lean toward truth, but I can’t rule out that frown being a stress response from being questioned about something uncomfortable, even if they’re being honest.  

I guess the counterargument is: maybe they’re just really good at hiding it? But the sideways gaze and frown together don’t scream "lying" to me—they feel more like someone who’s concentrating hard or maybe a bit annoyed. Like, if they were making it up, I’d expect them to look away more or seem more tense overall. Here, they seem... focused, even if a little strained. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure, but based on what I’m seeing—no obvious nervousness, consistent eye contact, just that slight frown and sideways glance—I’d probably guess they’re telling the truth. But I’d still be cautious. People can be deceptive in subtle ways, and that sideways look *could* be a habit, not a tell. It’s not like I’m 100% sure, but the evidence seems to point more toward honesty than deception.

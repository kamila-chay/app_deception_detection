Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone since I don't have context about what they're talking about. From what I can see, the person isn't smiling or laughing at all, which is interesting—usually, if someone's being deceptive, they might force a smile or seem overly polite, but here they're just... frowning. Like, they have those tight, downturned eyebrows the whole time, but nothing else. No nervous twitches, no avoiding eye contact (wait, actually, the gaze toward the other person is listed as false, so they're not looking at whoever they're talking to? That part makes me pause).  

I keep thinking, "If they were lying, wouldn't they at least look more tense?" But they're just sitting there with that quiet frown, not shifting in their seat or touching their face or anything. The absence of those classic "nervous liar" cues—like fidgeting, lip biting, or rapid blinking—makes me lean toward them being genuine. Maybe they're just genuinely upset or concentrating hard on what they're saying, not trying to hide something. Like, if I'm explaining something complicated to someone and I'm not sure how they'll react, I might just frown without realizing it.  

But then I second-guess myself because avoiding eye contact *is* often a sign people associate with lying. If they're not looking at the person, maybe they're uncomfortable with the truth? Though I've also heard that some people naturally avoid eye contact when they're being honest—like if they're shy or just not used to direct conversation. And the frown isn't even a full scowl; it's just a subtle furrow, which feels more like thought than deception.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to overread these things. If I had to guess based on just the video, I'd say it *feels* like they're telling the truth—the lack of other stress signals seems to outweigh the frown and the gaze thing. But I wouldn't bet money on it. People are complicated, and without knowing the topic or their usual behavior, it's really hard to say. Maybe they're just having a bad day, and that's why they're frowning. Either way, I don't see the "tells" I'd expect if they were lying.

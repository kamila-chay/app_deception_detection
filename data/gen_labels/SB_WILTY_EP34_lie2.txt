Hmm, this is a tough one. Watching the clip, the person seems a bit tense, but it's really hard to say for sure if they're lying. They're definitely blinking a lot—like, way more than normal—and their eyebrows are doing this odd mix of furrowing and raising at the same time. That's a bit confusing because usually, frowning shows discomfort, but raised eyebrows can look like surprise or even deception. I keep noticing them looking sideways a lot instead of straight at the person they're talking to, and their head keeps tilting and turning away slightly. The chin moving down a bit and the head pulling back a little too—like they're trying to physically create space—makes me think they're not fully engaged or maybe feeling defensive.

But then, I'm also thinking: maybe they're just really nervous about the situation, not lying. Like, if they're being interviewed about something stressful—maybe bad news or a tough question—they might naturally fidget or avoid eye contact even if they're telling the truth. People blink more when they're anxious, not just when they're lying. And the way they're keeping their gaze *mostly* on the other person sometimes, even with the sideways glances, feels like they're trying to be honest but struggling with the pressure. The head tilting and side-turning could just be their natural way of thinking, like how some people physically process things by shifting their posture.

On the flip side, the combination of the eyebrow movements, the frequent blinking, and the inconsistent eye contact *does* lean toward deception. Those micro-expressions—like the conflicting frown and raised brows—often show internal conflict, which can happen when someone's hiding something. The head pulling back and the sideways gaze might be classic signs of trying to distance themselves from the lie. But I'm really hesitant to say "definitely lying" because without knowing what they're talking about, it's easy to misread nervousness for dishonesty. Maybe they're just tired or distracted, or maybe they're lying about something minor that doesn't feel that big to them. I'd be cautious about calling it deception based on this alone—there's just too much room for other explanations. Honestly, I'd want more context before I'd feel confident either way.

Honestly, watching this clip, I’m a bit conflicted. On one hand, the person seems quite composed—they maintain steady eye contact, nod along consistently, and their posture is relaxed without any obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or awkward pauses. These behaviors generally suggest someone who is engaged and possibly truthful. You’d usually expect a liar to avoid eye contact or appear tense, but here it’s the opposite: calm demeanor, steady gaze, no glaring red flags.

However, that very smoothness is what gives me pause. Sometimes, people can be really good at controlling their behavior when they’re lying, intentionally masking the usual tells. It’s possible they’ve practiced being calm under scrutiny, especially if they’re confident or rehearsed their story carefully. Also, the topic might be something they feel comfortable with, so even if they are lying, there wouldn’t necessarily be stress cues.

The main thing is that the absence of nervousness doesn’t guarantee truthfulness—it just means the typical signs of deception aren’t present. Because I don’t see clear evidence either way, I’m leaning slightly towards the idea that they might be deceptive rather than completely honest. It’s not definitive, but the smoothness and lack of typical stress signals make me suspect they could be hiding something. Without more context, it’s hard to be sure, but I’d say there’s a reasonable chance they’re not telling the whole truth.

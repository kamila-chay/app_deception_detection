From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty calm while answering. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever's talking to them—looking directly at the interlocutor most of the time, which usually leans toward truthfulness since liars often avoid eye contact. There's no fidgeting, no nervous gestures like rubbing hands or covering their mouth, and their mouth is just... still. No fake smiles or awkward pauses either, which are common when people are trying to cover up a lie.  

But here's where it gets tricky: they keep raising their eyebrows a few times, which sometimes shows surprise or skepticism—but it could also be a nervous tic. I've heard some people say raised eyebrows are a "tell" for lying, like they're trying to seem innocent. And they do glance down occasionally, which some might interpret as avoiding the truth. Still, the way they're holding eye contact overall feels deliberate, not shifty. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—like biting their lip, looking away a lot, or fidgeting—but there's nothing like that.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The raised eyebrows *could* be a red flag, but it might just be them reacting to something unexpected in the conversation. The lack of other "lie cues" makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say they're probably telling the truth—but I'd want to hear more context to be certain. It just doesn't feel like someone who's scrambling for words or hiding something.

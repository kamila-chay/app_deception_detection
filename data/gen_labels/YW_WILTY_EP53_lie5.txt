Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video. I'm watching someone answer a question, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. On one hand, they're blinking a lot—like, way more than usual for someone just talking normally. That kind of frequent blinking often makes me think someone's feeling stressed or uncomfortable, which can happen when lying. And they keep looking down instead of meeting the other person's eyes directly, which I've heard is a common sign of deception too. Plus, they shake their head a couple of times while talking, which feels a bit odd—like they're emphasizing something they're not sure about. Those things together make me lean toward "maybe lying," especially since the blinking and gaze avoidance seem to line up.

But then I keep second-guessing myself. Maybe their eyes are just dry from the lighting in the room, or they're just really focused on what they're saying and not thinking about where they're looking. I've seen people look down when they're trying to remember something, not necessarily when they're hiding something. And that head shake? It could just be a nervous habit—like how some people do it when they're talking to themselves, not necessarily to contradict anything. Also, they *are* looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which actually feels a bit counter to what I'd expect from someone lying (since liars often avoid eye contact entirely). So maybe they're just being thoughtful or a little shy, not deceptive.  

I guess the biggest thing is that there aren't any obvious "liar tells" like frowning, smiling too much, or fidgeting with their hands—those are the things I usually look for. Without those, it's hard to say for sure. It could be they're just a naturally expressive person who blinks a lot, or they're genuinely confused about the question. I wouldn't bet money on it, but based on what I'm seeing, the blinking and the downcast gaze are making me lean toward "possibly deceptive," though I'd want to see more context before I'd be confident. It's just not clear enough to say "yes, they're lying" or "no, they're telling the truth" for sure.

This is somewhat difficult to determine solely from the video, but based on what I’m observing, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying. Their frequent blinking is noticeably more than usual, which often suggests stress or discomfort—feelings commonly associated with deception. They also tend to look down rather than maintain steady eye contact, a behavior often linked to dishonesty. Additionally, the occasional head shake during their response feels like an attempt to emphasize something they might not fully believe or feel confident about. Taken together, these cues point somewhat toward deception.

That said, there are reasons to hesitate before concluding outright that they’re lying. The blinking could simply be due to dry eyes from the lighting, and looking down might indicate they’re concentrating or trying to recall information rather than hiding the truth. The head shake might just be a nervous tic rather than a sign of contradiction. It’s also worth mentioning that they do maintain eye contact most of the time, which doesn’t completely fit the pattern of someone being deceptive, as liars often avoid eye contact entirely.

Moreover, the absence of more obvious signs like fidgeting, excessive smiling, or facial expressions that commonly accompany lying means it’s not a clear-cut case. While the cues I’ve noted suggest there’s a reasonable chance they could be deceiving, it’s far from certain. Overall, I lean toward believing they might not be fully truthful, but I’d need more information or context before being more confident in that judgment.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person's being truthful or not, and honestly? It's a bit tricky. They're not doing any of the obvious "lying signs" you'd expect—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no avoiding eye contact. In fact, they're looking pretty directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like a good sign for honesty. But then there's that sideways glance too, which I've noticed before—sometimes people do that when they're thinking hard, not necessarily lying. Like, they're processing what they're saying, not trying to evade.  

The thing that stands out most is the lips being slightly protruded—like they're just *thinking* instead of trying to sell something. If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy: maybe covering their mouth, shifting in their seat, or that stiff "smile" people fake when lying. But here, they're just nodding calmly while they talk, which feels natural. Nodding while speaking? That usually happens when you're agreeing with yourself or recalling something real, not when you're fabricating.  

But here's where I hesitate: could that sideways gaze be a sign they're not fully present? Like, maybe they're rehearsing what they're saying? I've seen people do that when they're nervous, even if they're telling the truth. And the lips—sometimes people pout when they're frustrated or concentrating, not just when lying. It's not a big deal, but it's not *definitely* a truth sign either.  

Honestly, the most convincing part is how *nothing* feels off. No exaggerated movements, no awkward pauses, no signs of stress. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those things to pop up—like a sudden blink or a hand covering their mouth. But here, it's all pretty steady. I keep thinking, "If this was a lie, wouldn't there be *some* tell?" And there just isn't. So yeah, I'm leaning toward truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It could be they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe they're just a naturally quiet person. Either way, the absence of deception cues makes me think they're probably telling it straight. But I'd want to see more of the conversation to be certain.

Looking at this clip, I'm actually a bit torn on whether they're being truthful or not. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with the camera (what the description calls "gaze towards interlocutor"), which usually feels like a sign of honesty—people who are lying often avoid direct eye contact or glance away more. They're also nodding along naturally, which seems like genuine engagement rather than forced agreement. Plus, there's absolutely no sign of nervous habits: no fidgeting, no excessive blinking, no lip biting or hand movements. That calmness makes me lean toward thinking they might be telling the truth, especially since they're not showing the classic "tells" we often associate with deception.

But then I keep circling back to the sideways glances. They keep looking slightly off to the side while speaking, which feels a bit odd when they're supposed to be focusing on the camera. I know some people do that naturally while thinking, but it could also be a sign they're constructing a story—like they're glancing away to "remember" something. And honestly, the absence of *any* nervous behavior is kind of suspicious too. If someone's lying and they're really good at hiding it, they might not show those signs, but it also makes me wonder if they're just really practiced or even rehearsed what they're saying. Like, maybe they've said this line a hundred times before and it's all second nature, so they're not fidgeting—but that doesn't mean it's true.

I also keep thinking about how people often *over*-compensate when they're lying. If they *were* nervous, they might have been more obvious—like the description says, no "frowning eyebrows" or "frequent blinking," but that could mean they're suppressing it instead of not feeling it. But then again, maybe they're just not the type to fidget. I've known people who stay completely still when they're being truthful, so it's hard to say.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The eye contact and nodding feel like they're trying to seem sincere, but that sideways glance is nagging at me. It’s possible they’re being truthful and just have a natural way of looking around while talking, or it’s possible they’re being deceptive but doing it so smoothly that the "tells" aren't there. Without more context—like what they're actually saying or how they're reacting to questions—it’s really hard to call. I’d say it’s leaning toward truthful because of the calm demeanor, but I wouldn’t bet on it. It’s one of those cases where you just can’t be sure from the video alone.

Looking at this clip, I find myself leaning more toward the possibility that they might be deceptive, though I wouldn’t say it with complete certainty. While they do maintain fairly consistent eye contact and nod along in a way that seems natural, which often suggests honesty, there are some subtle cues that raise doubt. For instance, the repeated sideways glances stand out as somewhat unusual given they’re supposed to be focused on the camera. This behavior could be innocent—just a natural way of thinking—but it could also indicate they’re trying to fabricate or recall a story, which is a common sign of deceit.

Additionally, the complete absence of any nervous habits feels a bit suspicious. While a calm demeanor might suggest truthfulness, it’s also possible they are simply very practiced or rehearsed, delivering their lines so smoothly that typical “tells” don’t appear. The lack of common signs like fidgeting or blinking doesn’t necessarily mean they’re honest; rather, it might indicate suppression or an intentional effort to mask nervousness.

Overall, the eye contact and nodding might be attempts to project sincerity, but the sideways glances combined with the unusually composed behavior make me tend to doubt their truthfulness. Without more context or information about their responses, it’s difficult to say definitively, but given the subtle inconsistencies, I’m inclined to think they might not be entirely truthful.

Looking at the video, I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like they're probably telling the truth. The way they're nodding while keeping eye contact with the person they're talking to feels genuine—like they're actively listening and agreeing, not trying to fabricate something. Their gaze does drop down a bit sometimes, but they're still looking at the other person overall, and that chin moving down slightly doesn't seem forced, more like they're just thinking or being thoughtful. There's no sign of the usual stress cues either—no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no nervous blinking, which makes me lean toward truth.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes people look down when they're lying, especially if they're trying to avoid eye contact, but here they're still making eye contact most of the time. The slight frown could just be concentration, not deception. And yeah, maybe they're just nervous about the topic, which could explain the gaze down and chin movement without meaning they're lying. But honestly, the absence of those classic "lie" behaviors—like the exaggerated expressions or hands covering their face—makes it feel less like they're hiding something. I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing, it seems more like they're being honest than not.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% sure, but here's how I'm reading it. The person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is actually a bit unusual for someone who's lying, since a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact. They're also nodding along while speaking, which feels natural, like they're agreeing with themselves or just processing what they're saying. But then there are some things that make me pause: their eyebrows are raised a lot, and they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying to seem extra attentive or maybe a bit nervous. The way they open their eyes wide sometimes feels a little forced, like they're overcompensating to look sincere. And their lips are pulled up at the corners a bit, not quite a smile, but like they're trying to keep it neutral while they talk.

On the one hand, the eye contact and nodding feel like they're being genuine—those are signs people usually associate with truth-telling. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding the gaze, but they're not doing that. The raised eyebrows and blinking could just be from being in a bright room or feeling a bit anxious about the interview, not necessarily lying. On the other hand, the exaggerated eye movements and the way they're holding their lips might hint that they're trying too hard to seem calm, which sometimes happens when someone's hiding something. But honestly, I'm not sure—those cues aren't super reliable. A lot of people blink a lot when they're just thinking hard, and raised eyebrows can just mean they're surprised or curious about the question. The fact that they're not covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands also makes me lean toward them being truthful; liars often do those things without realizing it. Still, I can't rule out that they're nervous about the topic itself, not necessarily lying. It's tricky—without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to tell if those behaviors are from deception or just being a bit stressed about being on camera. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's also just as plausible they're being honest and just a little tense. I wouldn't bet on it either way.

Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. Watching the clip, the person seems pretty calm at first glance—no obvious signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, which often make people think someone's lying. They're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually leans toward truthfulness. But then there's that weird chin movement—up and down, like they're subtly nodding or tensing their jaw. It feels a little off, almost like they're trying to force themselves to seem relaxed. And they keep glancing sideways, which isn't the usual "avoiding gaze" pattern I'd expect if they were lying; it seems more like they're distracted or thinking hard, maybe even rehearsing what to say.  

That said, it’s easy to overread things. Maybe they just have a habit of moving their chin when they're focused, or the sideways glance is just how they process information naturally. I’ve seen people do that without any deception involved—like when they’re trying to recall something. And the raised eyebrows? Could just be surprise at the question, not nervousness. Truth-tellers sometimes raise their eyebrows too when they’re being honest but caught off-guard.  

The tricky part is the *absence* of classic liar cues. No fidgeting, no forced smiles, no rapid blinking. If they were lying, I’d expect *more* of those signs, not fewer. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so the lack of obvious tells might just mean they’re skilled at lying. Still, I’m leaning toward them being truthful—not because they’re perfect, but because the behavior doesn’t scream "deception" like the classic signs do. It feels more like someone who’s just a little uncomfortable or lost in thought, not actively hiding something. But I’d need more context—like what they’re actually saying—to be sure. Honestly? I’d hesitate to call it deception without hearing the full conversation. It’s just... quiet. And that quietness is hard to read.

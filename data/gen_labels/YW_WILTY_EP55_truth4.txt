Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain because it's really hard to tell just from body language alone. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really engaged in the conversation—and they're nodding along at natural intervals, which feels like genuine agreement or understanding. I don't see any of the classic "nervous" tells people often associate with lying: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses or weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiling. That calm, steady presence makes me think they're comfortable with what they're saying.  

But then again, I know some people can lie really smoothly without showing any of those signs—they might even practice keeping their eyes locked on you or nodding to seem sincere. Like, if they're rehearsed or just really good at hiding it, the lack of "tells" doesn't *prove* they're honest. I've seen people who seem totally relaxed while lying, especially if they're used to being on camera or in high-pressure situations. And honestly, without hearing the actual words or knowing the context, it's tricky. Maybe they're just very calm by nature, or maybe they're lying but don't have the physical reactions we'd expect.  

Still, the way they're sitting/standing—no crossed arms, no hands covering their face, just open and engaged—feels more like someone who's being straightforward. It's not a perfect sign, but it's the strongest thing I'm noticing. I'd say it's *more likely* truth based on this, but I'd want to hear the conversation or see more context before I'd feel totally sure. Like, if they were denying something that's obviously false, I'd worry more—but here, it just looks like a normal, relaxed exchange. So yeah, I'm leaning truth, but I'd hesitate to call it a slam dunk.

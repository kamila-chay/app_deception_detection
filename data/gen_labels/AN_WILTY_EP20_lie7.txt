Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's actually pretty tricky. At first glance, there are a few things that make me lean toward them being deceptive, but then other cues pull me the other way. For example, they keep tilting their head slightly while talking, which sometimes happens when people are trying to seem engaged or thoughtful, but it can also be a nervous habit when someone's not being straightforward. And their gaze is mostly down—not directly at the person they're talking to, which I've heard is a common sign of deception, like they're avoiding eye contact to not get caught. Their eyebrows are raised too, which might mean they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, but I've also seen that happen when people are just processing something, not necessarily lying.

But then there are other things that make me doubt that. Their palms are up the whole time—like, they're holding their hands open, which usually signals honesty or openness, not deception. I've read that people who lie often hide their hands or make closed-off gestures, so that feels like a strong counterpoint. And even though their gaze is down, they're still looking *at* the person, just not directly in the eyes—like they're glancing at their chest or something, which could just be shyness or just how they think. I also don't see any obvious signs like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or fake smiles, which are things I'd expect if someone was being deceptive. If they were lying, I'd probably expect more of those physical tells, but here it's pretty calm, aside from the head tilting and gaze.

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The head tilt and down gaze could be deceptive, but the palms up and lack of other nervous cues make me think they might actually be telling the truth. Maybe they're just naturally a bit reserved or thoughtful when speaking, and I'm overthinking it. Or maybe the head tilt is just a habit, not a sign of lying. I'd need more context—like what they're talking about or how they usually behave—to feel confident. Right now, I'm leaning more toward them being truthful, but I'm not at all certain. It's the kind of thing where if I had to guess, I'd say "probably not lying," but I'd definitely want to see it again or hear the conversation to be sure.

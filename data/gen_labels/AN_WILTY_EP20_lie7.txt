Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m inclined to think they might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. There are several subtle cues that make me lean in that direction. For instance, the consistent head tilting while talking can sometimes indicate nervousness or an attempt to appear thoughtful when someone is actually being deceptive. Their gaze is mostly downward and avoids direct eye contact, which is often associated with dishonesty, as people might look away to avoid giving themselves away. The raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or skepticism about what they’re saying, but in the context of the other behaviors, it might also hint at some internal discomfort related to deception.

That said, there are factors that complicate the picture. Their open palms typically suggest honesty and openness, which usually contradicts deception. They maintain a calm demeanor without obvious signs like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or fake smiles that are often seen in lying. However, these absences don’t necessarily rule out deception, as some people are quite skilled at hiding it.

Given these mixed signals, I lean toward the possibility that they are not being entirely truthful. The combination of the head tilt, downward gaze, and raised eyebrows feels more consistent with deceptive behavior, despite the open palms and calmness. It’s not a definitive conclusion, but based on the cues present, I’m more suspicious of their honesty than not—though I’d want to see more context or additional behavior to be more certain.

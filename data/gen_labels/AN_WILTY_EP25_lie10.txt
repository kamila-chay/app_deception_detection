Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn about whether they're lying or not. They're maintaining steady eye contact the whole time—looking right at the camera like they're engaged in the conversation—which feels a bit unusual if they were trying to hide something. Most people who lie tend to look away or seem distracted, so that makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, but I know that's not a hard rule.  

They also have their arms crossed the whole time, which I've seen interpreted as defensiveness or discomfort—like maybe they're nervous about what they're saying. But honestly, I've crossed my arms while just being comfortable or thinking, so it could easily be neutral. And they're tilting their head slightly, which often looks like they're listening or trying to understand, not like someone who's being deceptive. I don't see any of the classic "tells" either—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no forced smiles or tense jaw. They seem pretty relaxed in their posture overall, which sometimes happens when people are confident in their story.  

That said, I can see why someone might think they're lying. Crossed arms *can* signal defensiveness, and if they're being deceptive, they might be trying too hard to seem calm. But the direct eye contact and lack of nervous energy really stand out to me. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to seem more tense or avoid eye contact to not get caught. The fact that they're holding eye contact while relaxed feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying, even if they're wrong.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It's possible they're lying but just good at hiding it, or maybe they're telling the truth but crossed their arms for no reason. I'd probably say it's more likely they're being truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. The behavior just doesn't scream "deception" to me like I'd expect if someone was lying. It feels... normal, even a little thoughtful. But I'm definitely not ruling out the possibility they're hiding something—it's just not jumping out at me like it usually would.

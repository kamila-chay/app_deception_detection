Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I find myself leaning slightly toward the idea that the person might be lying. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which might seem like a sign of honesty at first, but it's also possible they're deliberately staring to appear more credible. The complete absence of typical nervous behaviors—no blinking, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses—feels almost too controlled, as if they're consciously masking any discomfort. While some people naturally stay composed when telling the truth, this unusual calmness raises a bit of suspicion. Usually, if someone is lying, you'd expect at least some subtle signs of tension, so the lack of those cues here might suggest they’re trying too hard to seem natural, which itself can be a red flag. Without knowing more about their normal behavior or the context of the conversation, I can't be certain, but I do lean toward the possibility that they are not being entirely truthful.

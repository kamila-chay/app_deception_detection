Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit of a toss-up for me. The person is definitely looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—no shifting eyes, no glancing away—and they're not doing anything else that stands out as nervous or fidgety. Like, no blinking a lot, no touching their face, no awkward pauses where their mouth just stays shut. They seem pretty composed, which makes me wonder: if they were lying, wouldn't they at least seem a little tense? I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I've also read that some liars actually stare too hard to seem honest, so that steady gaze could go either way.  

On the flip side, though, the lack of any other tells feels... weirdly calm. If they were being completely truthful, it's not unusual for someone to just speak normally without extra gestures or expressions—especially if they're used to talking to people or just naturally reserved. Maybe they're not stressed because they're not lying, and the lack of fidgeting is just them being relaxed. I mean, I've seen people tell the truth while looking right at me with no signs of discomfort, so it's not a dead giveaway.  

But here's where I get stuck: if they *were* lying, why aren't they showing *any* of the usual signs? Like, if they were nervous, you'd expect maybe a little more blinking or a tight jaw, but there's nothing. It almost feels like they're trying too hard to seem natural, which could be a red flag. But honestly, it could also just be their normal way of talking—some people just don't fidget. Without knowing the context of what they're saying or how they usually act, it's really hard to tell. I'd lean a tiny bit toward them being truthful just because the absence of stress cues feels more consistent with honesty than deception, but I'm not at all confident about it. It's one of those cases where the video just doesn't give me enough to go on, and I'd need to hear the actual words or see more of their usual behavior to feel sure.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tricky because body language can mean so many different things depending on the situation. Right off the bat, they're making a lot of eye contact with the person they're talking to—that seems pretty engaged, not like someone who's avoiding your gaze because they're hiding something. And their hands are open, palms up, with arms spread out like they're being straightforward. That usually reads as open and honest to me, not like someone trying to cover up a lie.

They're also nodding a lot while they're speaking, which feels natural—it's like they're emphasizing points or agreeing with themselves as they talk, not something I'd immediately associate with deception. And that shrug at the end? It seemed like a genuine "I don't know" or "that's just how it is" gesture, not the kind of nervous shrug people sometimes do when they're trying to deflect. 

But then there's the eyebrow thing—raising them a few times. I know some people say raised eyebrows can signal stress or uncertainty, which *might* point to lying, but honestly? I've seen people do that all the time when they're just surprised or trying to sound thoughtful. It doesn't feel like a "tell" to me, especially since they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact otherwise. 

The thing is, without knowing what they're actually saying or the context, it's really hard to judge. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person who raises their eyebrows a lot, or maybe they're genuinely confused about the question. The open posture and eye contact seem to lean toward truthfulness, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at faking it. I've seen people act super calm and open while lying before, so I wouldn't want to jump to conclusions. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just based on how present and engaged they seem—no signs of the classic "nervous liar" stuff like avoiding eyes or fidgeting. But I'm not 100% sure. It's possible they're just really composed, or maybe the situation is just making them seem more relaxed than usual. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I'd want to hear the actual conversation first to be sure. It's just hard to tell from body language alone.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I can't be entirely certain, but I tend to lean toward the idea that they might be lying. While they are making a lot of eye contact and have an open posture with palms up and arms spread out—usually signs of honesty—those cues can sometimes be deliberately controlled to appear truthful. Their frequent nodding seems natural, but it could also be a way to reinforce their statements and convince the listener. The shrug at the end appeared genuine, yet gestures like that can sometimes mask uncertainty or evasion.

The raised eyebrows stand out a bit more; although some people raise their eyebrows out of surprise or thoughtfulness, it can also indicate stress or insecurity, which might suggest deception in this context. They’re not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but being composed and engaged doesn’t automatically mean they’re truthful—some people are skilled at maintaining that appearance while lying.

Without knowing the actual content of their words or the full context, it’s difficult to make a definitive judgment. The open body language and engagement hint toward honesty, but considering how people can intentionally mimic these signs, I’m inclined to suspect there might be some deception involved. So, while it’s not a clear-cut case, I’m leaning slightly toward them not being entirely truthful, although I wouldn’t say that with absolute confidence.

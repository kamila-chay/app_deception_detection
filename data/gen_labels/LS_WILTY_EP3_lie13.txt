Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward the possibility they're not being entirely truthful, but I'm not 100% sure—I'd need more context to feel confident. The way they're smiling while they talk feels a little off to me; it's not a natural, warm smile, more like they're trying too hard to seem friendly or relaxed. Their eyebrows are raised a lot, which often happens when someone's nervous or trying to seem surprised, and they're pulling their lips back slightly (lips retracted), which I've noticed sometimes happens when people are suppressing emotions. Then there's the head shaking—they keep shaking it side-to-side while they're talking, almost like they're saying "no" without words, which makes me think they're denying something even if they're not saying it outright. Their eyes are looking down a lot, too, which can be a sign of avoidance—like they're not wanting to meet the other person's gaze directly, which people sometimes do when they're hiding something.  

But honestly, I'm second-guessing myself because a lot of this could be innocent. The smile might just be their natural way of talking—some people smile a lot even when they're honest, especially if they're trying to be polite. The raised eyebrows could just mean they're genuinely surprised by the question, not lying. And head shaking? I've seen people do that constantly when they're just being expressive, like when they're emphasizing a point or just fidgeting. The gaze down might not even be about deception—it could just be how they think, or maybe they're shy. I've known people who look down while telling the truth because they're concentrating, not because they're hiding something.  

So yeah, the cues point toward deception in a way, but they're not definitive. It's easy to overread body language when you're not in the room with them, and I don't know the context of the conversation. If they were answering a question about something they clearly didn't do, that head shaking and the forced smile might add up. But if it's just a casual chat, it could all be for nothing. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it without hearing what they're actually saying. It's one of those moments where you just have to go with the gut feeling, and mine's leaning toward "not quite straight," but I'd want to see the whole clip or hear the words to be sure.

Based on the behavior observed in the video, it seems more likely than not that the person is not being entirely truthful. The smile they display feels somewhat forced rather than genuine, which often suggests an attempt to appear friendly or at ease when they might not be. Their frequent raised eyebrows could indicate nervousness or an effort to feign surprise. Additionally, the slight retraction of their lips is a common sign of someone trying to hold back emotions. The repeated side-to-side head shaking while speaking seems like a nonverbal denial, as if they’re refusing to acknowledge something without directly saying no. Their downward gaze suggests avoidance, which can be a subtle sign of concealing information or discomfort with eye contact. 

While it’s true that these behaviors can sometimes have innocent explanations—it’s possible the smile is just their usual manner, the raised eyebrows could reflect genuine surprise, and the head shaking might be a habitual gesture—the overall combination of these cues leans toward the likelihood of deception. People do sometimes look down when concentrating or feeling shy, but paired with the other signals, this avoidance feels more suspect. Without more context, it’s hard to be certain, but the impression here is that they’re not telling the whole truth. So, although it’s not definitive, I tend to lean toward believing they may be lying.

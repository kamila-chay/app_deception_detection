Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like frowning, laughing, or avoiding eye contact entirely. In fact, they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels a bit counter to what I'd expect if they were lying. But then there's this *lot* of blinking—like, way more than normal. I've heard people blink a lot when they're stressed or trying to think of something, so that made me pause. 

But wait, I should be careful. I know blinking can just be from dry eyes, or maybe they're just tired. Like, I blink a ton when I'm reading a screen, and I'm not lying about anything. And they're not doing anything else that screams "nervous liar"—no lip biting, no hand fidgeting, no awkward pauses. The head turning sideways is kind of odd, but it's subtle, and it doesn't seem like they're avoiding the gaze entirely. It almost feels like they're just adjusting their position naturally, not hiding something. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, why would they maintain eye contact while blinking so much? Most of the "tells" I've heard about involve looking away, but here they're not. Maybe the blinking is just a habit, or maybe they're genuinely stressed about the topic, not the lie. I mean, even if they're telling the truth, some people get nervous in interviews. 

I guess I'm leaning toward them *not* lying, but it's not a strong feeling. The blinking is the only thing that sticks out, and it's not a perfect indicator. Like, if they'd been sweating or fidgeting, I'd be more sure, but this feels... neutral. Maybe the "lie" label they mentioned earlier is wrong? Or maybe I'm missing something. Honestly, I'd need to see more context—what they're even talking about—to feel confident. Right now, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not ruling out the possibility they're lying and just not showing the usual signs. It's one of those cases where the behavior doesn't scream "lie," but it also doesn't scream "truth" either. Just... normal, with a tiny weird thing.

Looking at this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. While on the surface they appear relaxed—with a smile, natural-seeming laughter, palms up, and steady eye contact—there are subtle cues that raise some doubt. The laughter, although seemingly genuine, could be masking nervousness or an attempt to deflect, especially if the topic is sensitive. Palms up, usually a sign of openness, might here be a gesture meant to overemphasize innocence, which can sometimes indicate deception. The casual head turn could also be a subtle sign of mental processing that occurs when someone is fabricating. 

That said, there aren't many classic signs of lying such as fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which makes the situation less clear-cut. It's possible the person is simply cheerful or reacting naturally to a light-hearted question. Without more context, it's difficult to be certain. However, based on the available cues, I lean slightly towards the idea that the person might be bending the truth, though I wouldn’t say this with high confidence. More information about the conversation would be necessary to make a stronger assessment.

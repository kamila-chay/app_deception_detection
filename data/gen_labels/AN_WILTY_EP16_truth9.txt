Hmm, I watched the clip a few times over. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting, forced smiles, or weird blinking. They didn't laugh or scowl, which is interesting. What stood out was how they kept looking down and slightly sideways, not directly at whoever they were talking to. And they crossed their fingers a couple of times, like when they paused to think. 

On one hand, the gaze down and sideways *could* make me think they're avoiding eye contact, which people often associate with lying. I've heard that before—like, "if they won't look you in the eye, they're hiding something." And crossing fingers... well, that's one of those things people *think* means they're lying, like they're trying to "cross their fingers for luck" while they're being dishonest. I almost went down that path. 

But then I paused. I've also seen people look away when they're just thinking hard or being shy, not necessarily lying. Like, I do it all the time when I'm trying to remember something. And crossing fingers? It could just be a nervous habit—maybe they do that when they're concentrating, not because they're being deceptive. Plus, they didn't seem rushed or tense; their voice was steady, and they didn't have that "awkward pause" where people stumble when they're making something up. 

Honestly, the lack of other "red flags" (no fake smiles, no frantic gestures) makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I'm not 100% sure. Gaze direction alone isn't a solid indicator—it's super context-dependent. Like, if they're in a culture where direct eye contact is rude, looking down wouldn't mean anything. And crossing fingers? Could mean anything. I think I'd need more to go on—like the actual content of what they're saying or how they're reacting to questions. 

So yeah, I'm leaning toward "truth" based on what I saw, but it's not a slam dunk. It's easy to misread these things, and I wouldn't bet money on it. They just seemed... normal, not like someone who's trying to hide something. But I'd hesitate to say for sure without more context.

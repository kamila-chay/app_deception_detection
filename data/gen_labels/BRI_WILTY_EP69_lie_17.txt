I'm watching this clip and trying to gauge if the person is being truthful. While there are no obvious signs like smiling or frowning—their expression remains pretty neutral, which is noteworthy—what draws my attention is how frequently they raise their eyebrows, almost as if they're surprised or internally questioning something. Additionally, they keep looking sideways rather than directly at the person they're speaking to. Their frequent nodding also seems somewhat exaggerated, almost as if they're trying too hard to appear agreeable or maybe buying time.

Given that people who lie sometimes avoid eye contact and exhibit micro-expressions like raised eyebrows due to stress, these behaviors make me lean toward the possibility that they might not be entirely truthful. Of course, it's also possible that they're simply nervous in this setting—people often glance away when they're concentrating on their response, not necessarily because they're hiding something. The nodding might be a habit or an effort to keep the conversation moving. Since there aren’t other classic signs of lying—like fidgeting, face touching, or complete avoidance of eye contact—it could also be anxiety rather than deceit.

Still, the combination of raised eyebrows and sideways glances strikes me as somewhat suspicious. Overall, I lean toward thinking there may be some deception involved, but I wouldn’t say it’s certain—there’s enough that could point to nervousness or awkwardness instead. Without further context, it’s difficult to make a definitive judgment, but my impression is more inclined toward them not being fully truthful.

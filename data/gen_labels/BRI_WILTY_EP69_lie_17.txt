I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because I don't see any obvious signs like smiling or frowning—they seem pretty neutral in expression, which is interesting. But what stands out is how often they're raising their eyebrows, almost like they're surprised or questioning something internally, and they keep looking sideways instead of directly at the person they're talking to. They're also nodding a lot, which feels a bit over the top, like they're trying to seem agreeable or maybe buying time.  

Now, I know that when people lie, they sometimes avoid eye contact and show micro-expressions like raised eyebrows as a sign of stress. So that makes me lean toward them possibly not being entirely truthful. But then I think—maybe they're just naturally nervous in interviews or recordings? I've seen people glance away when they're just thinking hard about an answer, not because they're hiding something. The nodding could be a habit or just an attempt to seem engaged, especially if they're trying to keep the conversation flowing. And since they're not showing any other classic "lie" cues—like fidgeting, touching their face, or avoiding eye contact completely—it feels like it might just be anxiety rather than deception.  

I'm not totally sure though. It's easy to overinterpret body language, and these behaviors can happen for so many reasons. If they were telling the truth, they might still look away if they're uncomfortable with the question, or maybe they're just not great at maintaining eye contact. But the combination of the raised eyebrows and the sideways glance does feel a bit off to me. I'd say it's leaning toward deception, but I wouldn't bet on it—there's enough room for doubt that they're just being awkward or stressed. It's one of those cases where without more context, it's hard to call.

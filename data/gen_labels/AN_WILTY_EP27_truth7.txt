Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it feels like they're probably telling the truth. They're keeping steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor and gaze up both being true—so they're not avoiding their eyes, which often makes people think someone's hiding something. Plus, their arms are open, which usually reads as relaxed and receptive, not closed-off like someone trying to hide. And they're not fidgeting or doing those classic "lie signs" like covering their mouth or over-explaining. The raised eyebrows feel a bit curious or maybe surprised, not nervous, which lines up with them just being engaged in the conversation.

But I can see why someone might second-guess it. Some people *do* look up when they're thinking of a lie, especially if they're rehearsing what to say, so that "gaze up" could be a red herring. And raising eyebrows can sometimes be a way to seem innocent or overly eager to convince you, though it doesn't feel forced here. It's also possible they're just naturally expressive—maybe they're genuinely surprised by the question or the situation, which would explain the raised brows without any deception. I've seen people with similar reactions who were completely honest, but I also know there's no single "tell" for lying. Body language can be tricky because it depends so much on the person's baseline. If this was someone who usually avoids eye contact, the fact they're looking straight at the camera might be a sign they're trying to seem truthful, but if they're usually open and expressive, it just feels normal. 

At the end of the day, the absence of nervous ticks (no blinking, no frowning, no hand movements) and the consistent, relaxed posture makes it feel more like they're just being themselves. It's not a perfect indicator, but it leans toward truth for me—though I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure. It's hard to say for certain without more context, but the behavior here doesn't scream "lying" to me.

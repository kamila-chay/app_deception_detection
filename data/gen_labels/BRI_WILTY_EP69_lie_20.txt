Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's pretty ambiguous. They're not doing any of the classic "deception tells" people usually expect—like avoiding eye contact entirely, fidgeting, or smiling awkwardly. In fact, they're not even smiling at all, which actually feels a bit odd if they were trying to be deceptive, since some people fake smiles to seem more comfortable. Instead, they're raising their eyebrows a few times, which I've seen people do when they're genuinely surprised or trying to process something, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

What's throwing me off a bit is how they keep looking down and sideways instead of meeting the person's eyes. I know some people say that avoiding eye contact is a sign of lying, but I've also seen a lot of people do that when they're just thinking hard or feeling a little shy, especially in casual conversations. Like, maybe they're not used to being on camera or the question caught them off guard. The fact that they're not doing anything else—no lip biting, no hand rubbing, no awkward pauses—makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, right? But here, it just feels like they're being quiet and thoughtful, maybe even a bit distracted.  

On the flip side, though, I can see why someone might think it's deception. The raised eyebrows combined with the gaze shifts *do* feel a little off. Sometimes when people are being deceptive, they might unconsciously look away to avoid the weight of the question, and the eyebrows could be a stress reaction. But again, that's not a sure thing—it could just be how they naturally express themselves. I've known people who always raise their eyebrows when they're listening carefully, and they're totally honest.  

Honestly, without knowing the context of the question or what they're talking about, it's really hard to say. The behavior doesn't scream "lying" to me, but it also doesn't scream "truthful" with absolute clarity. It's just... neutral. Maybe they're just a little uncomfortable, or maybe they're being careful with their words. I'd probably need more to go on before I'd feel confident either way. Right now, I'm leaning toward "not lying" because the cues are so mild and mixed, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's one of those cases where it's probably just them being human, not anything deliberate.

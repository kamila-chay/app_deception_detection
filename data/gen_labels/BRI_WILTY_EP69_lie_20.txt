Based on the video, I’m inclined to think they might be lying, though I can’t be entirely sure. While they don’t exhibit the classic signs of deception like avoiding eye contact completely, fidgeting, or awkward smiling, some subtle cues do raise questions. For instance, their repeated eyebrow raises could suggest some level of discomfort or stress, which sometimes occurs when someone is trying to mask the truth. Although raised eyebrows can also indicate surprise or active processing, paired with their tendency to look down and sideways rather than directly at the other person, these behaviors feel somewhat inconsistent with straightforward honesty.

It’s true that people often look away or avoid eye contact when thinking hard or feeling shy, so that alone isn’t definitive proof of lying. However, the lack of other nervous signs—like lip biting or hand rubbing—doesn’t completely clear the air, since some individuals manage to control those more obvious tells. The combination of these subtle cues—shifting gaze and eyebrow movements—leans toward a guarded response, which can suggest they might be holding something back or being evasive.

While I understand that some people naturally exhibit these behaviors without deceit, the overall impression here is that something feels slightly off. Without knowing the context or the content of their answers, I can’t say for certain, but my intuition leans toward some level of deception rather than outright truthfulness. It’s not conclusive, but I would cautiously lean in the direction that they may not be fully telling the truth.

Looking at this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's kind of tricky. What stands out most is how they're shaking their head "no" while still holding direct eye contact with whoever's talking to them. I know people often think liars avoid eye contact, but here they're making it pretty steady, which feels a bit counterintuitive. Then there's the way they're looking up slightly while shaking their head—like they're trying to recall something, not fabricate it. I've heard that when people are being truthful and thinking, they often glance upward, so that might actually point to them being genuine, not deceptive.  

But I can see why someone might suspect deception too. Head shaking alone can sometimes feel nervous, especially if it's a bit exaggerated, and the fact that they're denying something firmly might raise eyebrows. Still, the lack of other classic "tells"—no fidgeting, no avoiding gaze, no awkward pauses—makes me lean away from deception. Most of the time, when people lie, they show more physical tension, but here they seem pretty composed.  

Honestly, though, I'm not 100% confident. It could be a practiced liar who's masking their nerves, or maybe they're just naturally expressive with their head. The gaze up is throwing me off—it feels more like genuine recall than deception. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual question they're answering before I'd feel solid about it. It's easy to jump to conclusions about lying, but sometimes the most obvious cues are the opposite of what we expect.

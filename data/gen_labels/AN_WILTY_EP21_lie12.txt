Looking at this clip, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though I can’t be completely sure. The most striking thing is how they shake their head "no" while maintaining steady eye contact, which is unusual because many people believe liars avoid eye contact. However, the confident gaze could also be a tactic to appear believable rather than an indicator of honesty. Additionally, the slight upward glance while shaking their head might seem like they’re trying to recall something, but it could also be a rehearsed behavior meant to mimic genuine thought, making it less reliable as a truth cue.

While it's true that they don’t display some classic signs of deception like fidgeting or gaze avoidance, the firmness of their head shake and the subtle tension it conveys feels somewhat off, as if it’s a bit exaggerated to convince others. The overall composure might be part of a practiced effort to mask any nervousness, which makes me more suspicious rather than less.

Though I’m not entirely convinced they’re lying, and there are hints supporting both possibilities, the combination of these signals nudges me to lean toward the likelihood that they could be deceptive. More context or information would be helpful, but based on what’s visible, I would cautiously suspect some level of dishonesty.

I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn because the person's behavior doesn't quite line up with what I'd expect if they were lying. They keep their eyes downcast the whole time—no looking at the camera or the person they're talking to—and that's the only noticeable thing. I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, so that part makes me lean toward "maybe they're hiding something." But then I think, "Wait, why would they look down *specifically*? Some people just naturally look down when they're thinking or feeling shy, especially if they're not used to being on camera."  

What throws me off is how calm they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no nervous gestures like touching their face or rubbing their hands. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* of those signs—like the classic "deer in headlights" reaction. But here, they're just... steady. Maybe they're really good at controlling themselves, or maybe they're just not nervous about what they're saying. It's weird because the down gaze *feels* like deception to me, but the lack of other cues makes me second-guess. Like, if someone's lying, wouldn't they at least seem a little tense?  

On the flip side, if they *were* telling the truth, the down gaze could just be their default way of speaking—maybe they're just a quiet person or distracted by what they're saying. I've seen that before with people who aren't lying but just aren't comfortable with direct eye contact. Honestly, I'm not sure. It's not screaming "liar" to me, but it's not "definitely truthful" either. I guess I'd lean toward them being honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just... weirdly neutral.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to and nodding along like they're fully engaged in the conversation. That usually makes me lean toward them being honest—people who are lying sometimes avoid eye contact or fidget, but here they seem calm and focused. The nodding especially feels natural, like they're genuinely following along, not just going through the motions.  

But then I keep second-guessing myself because I've heard that some skilled liars actually *do* make strong eye contact to seem trustworthy, and they might rehearse to avoid nervous habits. The fact that they're not fidgeting, blinking a lot, or looking away could just mean they're practiced at hiding it—not that they're being truthful. Like, maybe they've lied so many times before that they've stopped giving themselves away.  

Also, their speech seems smooth with no awkward pauses, which usually points to truthfulness, but I know that's not a hard rule. Some liars over-practice to sound perfect. Honestly, the lack of obvious stress cues (no raised eyebrows, lip biting, or hand movements) is making me think it's more likely they're being honest, but I'm not completely sold. It could just be that they're a really composed person, or they're so confident in their story that they don't feel the need to hide anything.  

At the end of the day, I'd probably say they seem truthful based on what I'm seeing—steady gaze, natural nods, no signs of tension—but I'd still be a little cautious. It's easy to misread these things, and I wouldn't bet the farm on it. If I had to guess, I'd say "truth" but with a big "maybe," because it's really hard to tell just from a clip like this.

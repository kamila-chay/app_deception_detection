Honestly, while I can’t be completely certain, I tend to lean toward thinking the person might be lying. The sideways glances, which aren’t directed at the camera or the person they’re speaking to, stand out because I’ve often heard that avoiding direct eye contact can be a sign of dishonesty. Although it’s true that people sometimes look away when thinking or trying to recall something, the repeated sideways looking feels a bit suspicious here, as if they might be trying to avoid confrontation or hide something.

The palms-up gesture usually signals openness and honesty, but in this context, it could be an attempt to overcompensate and appear trustworthy, especially since people who lie sometimes use such open gestures deliberately. The fact that they don’t show other obvious stress signs like fidgeting or facial tension makes it less clear, but it could also mean they’re trying hard to control their behavior to avoid giving themselves away.

There’s always the possibility that the sideways glance is just their normal mannerism or a reaction to something in the room, and that the palms-up gesture is simply natural for them, but given the cues together, I find myself leaning slightly toward the idea they could be deceptive. Without more context or knowing their usual behavior, it’s hard to say for sure, but my gut feeling is that there’s at least some reason to be skeptical of their truthfulness.

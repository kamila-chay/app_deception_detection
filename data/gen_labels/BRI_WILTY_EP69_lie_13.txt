Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing. The person in the video keeps looking sideways—like, not at the camera or the person they're talking to, but off to the side. I've heard a lot about liars avoiding eye contact, so that part makes me pause and wonder if it's a sign of deception. But then I also remember reading that people often look away when they're just thinking or recalling something, not necessarily lying. Like, if you're trying to remember a detail, your eyes might drift sideways naturally, right? So that could just be them processing what they're saying, not hiding anything.

Then there's the palms up thing—they're holding their hands open, palms facing up, which usually feels like a sign of openness or honesty to me. I've seen that a lot in interviews where people seem genuinely trying to be transparent. But I guess it could be a nervous gesture too, like if they're trying to seem innocent, though that feels a bit forced. The rest of their body seems pretty calm—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no frowning or anything. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that, like maybe touching their face or avoiding eye contact more intensely. But here, it's just the sideways glance and the palms up, which kind of cancel each other out.

On the flip side, maybe the sideways gaze is just their default way of looking when they're talking, like they've always done it. Or maybe they're distracted by something in the room, not the conversation. And palms up isn't a universal sign—it could be cultural or just how they gesture naturally. I've also read that people who lie sometimes *over*-compensate with open gestures to seem trustworthy, so that might actually be a red herring. 

Honestly, it's tough. The sideways gaze leans toward deception in my head, but the palms up and lack of other stress cues make me doubt it. I'd probably need more context—like what they're saying, or if this is a normal pattern for them. Without that, I'd say it's a maybe, but not a strong "yes" or "no." It could easily be them just being a little thoughtful while telling the truth. I wouldn't bet on it either way.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing. The person is looking directly at whoever they're talking to the whole time—like, really steady eye contact, not glancing away. That usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, since people often avoid eye contact when they're lying. But then there's this one thing: they keep raising their eyebrows, like, really noticeably. It's not a smile or a frown—just that sharp, upward lift of the brows. I've heard some people say that's a sign of deception, like they're trying to seem surprised or processing something they're not supposed to be. But honestly, I've also seen people do that when they're genuinely confused or just making an effort to seem engaged. 

On the flip side, there's nothing else that screams "lying" to me. No awkward pauses where their mouth's closed, no fidgeting with their hands, no lip biting or anything. They're just... sitting there, looking at the person, with those eyebrows going up and down. If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous tells—like avoiding eye contact or fiddling with their clothes. But they're not doing any of that. It feels a bit odd, though, because the eyebrow thing sticks out. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're trying to seem like they're listening hard, which could be a cover. 

I'm kind of torn. The eye contact is strong for truth, but the eyebrow thing is throwing me off. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to see the context—like, what are they even talking about?—because sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're being honest and just really processing the question. Like, "Wait, did you say that?" not "I'm making this up." So yeah, I'm leaning toward truth, but I'm not at all confident. It could easily be the opposite, and I'd feel pretty silly if I was wrong.

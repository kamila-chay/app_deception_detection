Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit hard to pin down whether they're lying or not. The person has this really open posture—palms up, arms stretched out like they're being transparent, and they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to be engaged. That kind of direct eye contact and open hands usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, especially since liars often cross their arms or avoid eye contact. But then there's the way their mouth is pulled down at the corners and their eyebrows are raised—like they're skeptical or maybe a little tense? I've seen people do that when they're nervous about something, not necessarily lying. The shrug at the end also feels kind of neutral, like they're saying "I don't know" rather than trying to cover something up.  

On the flip side, though, those raised eyebrows and downturned lips could just be their normal expression when they're thinking hard, not deception. Maybe they're genuinely unsure about what they're saying, or the question just caught them off guard. I've noticed people with that kind of "wait, really?" look when they're being honest but surprised. And the fact that they're not smiling or laughing—well, that could go either way. Some liars don't smile, but so do people who are just serious or uncomfortable.  

Honestly, the open body language is the strongest clue here. Palms up and arms open are pretty clear signals of openness, and they're holding that gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect them to fidget more or look away, but they're not. The other cues are a bit ambiguous, but they don't seem to contradict the open posture. So I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure—maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just naturally expressive when they're being honest. It's tricky, but based on what I'm watching, it feels more like truth than deception.

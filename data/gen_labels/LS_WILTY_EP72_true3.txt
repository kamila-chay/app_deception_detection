Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from watching, but here's how I'm reading it. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to (which feels like a good sign for honesty, since liars often avoid that), but they're also glancing down a few times while they speak. And they shrug once, which is interesting. Shrugs usually mean "I don't know" or "it's not my fault," which might actually fit with being truthful if they're just stating something they're unsure about or not responsible for.  

But then I keep thinking, *maybe* the down gaze is a sign of lying? Like, some people look down when they're trying to fabricate something. And the shrug could just be nervous habit, not necessarily honesty. I mean, I've seen people shrug when they're stressed or trying to seem casual, even if they're hiding something. So it's not a perfect indicator.  

Still, the fact that they're *not* avoiding eye contact at all stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting, more blinking, or more looking away—like, they'd seem *too* careful with their gaze. But here, they're just... normal. Looking at the person, glancing down like they're thinking, shrugging like it's no big deal. It feels like they're just being straightforward, not trying to hide anything. The absence of those classic "tells" (no nervous hands, no fake smiles, no forced pauses) makes me lean toward truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It could be that they're just really good at lying without showing it, or maybe they're just naturally a bit reserved. Honestly, I'd need to hear what they're saying to be more confident, but based on the behavior alone, it doesn't *feel* like they're lying. It feels like they're just talking plainly.

Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from this clip, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person is speaking, and the thing that stands out most is that they never look directly at whoever they're talking to—they keep their gaze sideways the whole time. I know a lot of people say avoiding eye contact is a sign of lying, but I've also heard that it can just be someone's natural way of speaking, like they're thinking things through or they're just not super comfortable with direct eye contact. And honestly, there's nothing else going on in their body language that screams "this person is faking it." No fidgeting, no weird lip movements, no awkward pauses—they're pretty still, which actually feels a bit more relaxed than what I'd expect from someone who's lying. Liars often do things like touch their face or shift around, but here they're just... quiet and still, with that sideways look.  

That said, I can see why someone might think it's suspicious. If they're avoiding eye contact *and* they're the kind of person who usually makes eye contact, it might feel off. Like, maybe they're nervous about what they're saying, or they're trying to hide something. But the description says there's no scowling or tense jaw either, which usually goes with stress. So maybe they're just not the type to look people in the eye when they're talking, even when they're being honest. I've known people like that—they're perfectly truthful but just have a habit of looking away while they think.  

All in all, the lack of other "nervous" cues makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not going to say for sure. It's possible the sideways gaze is a red herring, or maybe there's something going on that the camera doesn't show. But based on what I'm seeing—no other tells, no obvious signs of stress—I'd guess they're probably telling the truth. Still, I'd want to hear more context before I'd feel totally confident. It's one of those things where the behavior alone isn't enough to call it a lie, but it's not a clear "truth" signal either. Just seems... neutral, honestly.

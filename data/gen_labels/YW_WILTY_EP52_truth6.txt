Honestly, I'm not sure if I'd call this person a liar or not just from watching the clip—truth be told, it's really tricky. What stands out to me is how they're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually feels like a good sign for being honest. But then there's this mix of frowning eyebrows *and* raised eyebrows at the same time—they're kind of locked in that confused or thoughtful look, like they're really trying to process what they're saying. And they're tilting their head a bit while they talk, which I've noticed people do when they're listening carefully or even when they're just thinking hard, not necessarily when they're hiding something.  

That said, I could see someone arguing it's suspicious. Sometimes when people are lying, they'll frown because they're stressed, and the raised eyebrows might be a nervous tic—like they're trying to seem open but it's coming off as tense. And even though they're making eye contact, I've heard that some liars actually practice staring to seem convincing, so that might not mean much. Plus, the head tilting... I've read it can sometimes be a subtle sign of deception, like they're "weighing" their words, but it's super subtle here—no big dramatic moves, just a slight tilt.  

What throws me off is how calm the rest of their body is. No hands fidgeting, no lip biting, no awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words. If they were making it up, I'd expect more of that nervous energy. But then again, some people are really good at hiding stress—they might just be naturally quiet or thoughtful. Honestly, the more I watch it, the more I think they're probably telling the truth. The eye contact feels genuine, and the frowning/tilting combo seems like they're just really focused on being clear, not trying to dodge something. But I'd be lying if I said I was 100% sure—human behavior is messy, and without knowing the context, it's easy to misread. I'd lean toward "truth" based on what I see, but I'd want to hear the whole conversation first before I'd feel confident.

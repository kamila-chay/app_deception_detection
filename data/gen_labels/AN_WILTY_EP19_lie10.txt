Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. They're maintaining pretty steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but sometimes they overdo it to seem honest. They're also nodding along a lot, like they're really engaged, and their palms are up—open and relaxed, which usually feels like someone trying to seem trustworthy. There's no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiling. At first glance, it all looks pretty calm and natural, which might actually make me lean toward thinking they're telling the truth. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more nervous tells—maybe blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. But then I think, wait, maybe they're just really practiced at lying. Some people can keep it super smooth, no visible stress, and that "too perfect" calm could be a sign they're rehearsed or hiding something. The fact that they're not showing any of the classic "lie" signs is confusing because I'd expect *some* tension. But I've also read that not all liars act nervous—some are just cool under pressure. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The behavior seems open and cooperative, but it's tricky because the absence of red flags doesn't *prove* truthfulness. I guess I'm leaning toward truth, but I'd want to hear more context before I'd feel confident either way. It's hard to say for sure just from this alone.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're sitting with their arms open, which usually feels like an open, non-defensive posture—like they're not trying to hide anything, which leans toward truth. Their eyes are mostly focused on the person they're talking to, just with a slight downward gaze, and they're tilting their head a bit, which often shows engagement or thoughtfulness rather than deception. I also notice their lips are pulled down a little, and they have that frown-like look with their eyebrows, but it doesn't seem angry—it feels more like they're concentrating or maybe a bit stressed about what they're saying.  

The thing that stands out to me is how they're not smiling or laughing at all, and their mouth stays closed with these little pauses where they seem to be searching for words. Sometimes people lie and pause to make up stories, but other times, truthful people pause because they're recalling details or feeling uneasy about the topic. They're not doing any of the classic "tells" like blinking a lot, touching their face, or avoiding eye contact—those are the signs I usually hear about for lying, and they're absent here. The chin moving upward a few times also feels like they're thinking hard, not like they're trying to fake something.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. That downturned lip and the frowning eyebrows could just as easily be from anxiety or sadness about the subject, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're upset about what they're sharing, and that's making them look tense. And while the open arms are a good sign, some really practiced liars might deliberately keep their arms open to seem trustworthy. The awkward pauses could also be a red flag if they're trying to sound rehearsed, though it doesn't feel that way to me.  

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful because the cues don't match the usual "lying" profile—they're not hiding, they're not faking emotions, and they're engaging with the person they're talking to. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it, since body language isn't foolproof. It's possible they're just really good at staying calm under pressure, or maybe the topic is just heavy for them. I'd need more context to be sure, but based on what's here, I'd guess they're telling the truth, even if it's not 100% clear.

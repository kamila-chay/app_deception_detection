Hmm, this is tricky to call just from watching, but I'll try to break it down honestly. So, the person seems a bit tense while answering—like they're holding something back. I noticed they kept raising their eyebrows a lot, almost like they're trying to seem surprised or innocent, but it felt a bit forced. And they blinked way more than usual, like every few seconds, which usually means someone's stressed or trying to avoid eye contact. Their mouth was pulled up a little at the corners too, like a faint smile, but it didn't look genuine—it just seemed tight, like they were trying to look calm while actually being nervous. And yeah, they kept looking down at the floor a lot while still facing the person talking to them, which is weird. Normally, if someone's lying, they might avoid eye contact entirely, but here they're still looking at the interviewer but not directly. That kind of mixed signal makes me lean toward deception, but I'm not totally sure.

On the flip side, though, it could just be them being really nervous about the whole situation—maybe it's a job interview or they're in an uncomfortable spot, and that's why they're blinking so much and fidgeting a bit with their mouth. Some people naturally raise their eyebrows when they're concentrating, and the "smile" might just be them trying to be polite or friendly, not deceptive. I've seen people do that when they're just tired or anxious, not because they're lying. Plus, they didn't do any of the classic "lie signs" like scratching, covering their mouth, or avoiding eye contact completely—so it's not like they're all over the place with nervous habits. It's really subtle, and honestly, it's hard to tell if it's deception or just them being awkward. 

I guess my gut says it's probably deception because the combination of the raised eyebrows (which can signal "I'm trying to seem truthful"), the excessive blinking (stress), and the downcast gaze (avoiding direct contact) lines up more with what I've heard about lying cues. But I'd feel way more confident if they'd done something like shrug or cross their arms, which are bigger red flags. Without more context, though, it's just a hunch. It could very well be that they're just a naturally nervous person, and I'm overthinking it. I'd say it's a maybe, but leaning toward "yes, they're not being fully truthful," just because the cues add up a bit too neatly. Still, I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd be sure.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always a clear signal. What stands out to me is how they're holding their body—arms are open, which usually feels like someone's relaxed or trying to seem approachable, not defensive. And their head is tilted and turned slightly sideways, not staring straight at the camera or avoiding eye contact altogether. I've read that people often look sideways when they're thinking or just being natural, not necessarily hiding something. 

At first glance, the sideways gaze might make someone think they're lying (since we're trained to associate avoiding eye contact with deception), but I don't think that's the case here. They're not fidgeting, blinking a lot, or making those little "tells" like lip-pulling or scowling—those are more common when someone's stressed or lying. Instead, they seem calm, with a neutral expression and no awkward pauses. The open arms especially feel like they're trying to be honest, like they're not hiding anything. 

But I can see why someone might second-guess it. If this were a high-stakes situation—like a police interview—sideways gaze might raise eyebrows, but this feels more casual. Maybe they're just a person who naturally looks away when they're speaking, or they're focused on what they're saying rather than the camera. The head tilting also gives me a "listening" vibe, like they're engaged, not rehearsing a lie. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because the cues don't add up to deception. But I'm not 100% sure—body language can be messy. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's more likely they're being genuine, but I'd want to hear the context or their actual words to be certain. It just doesn't feel like the nervous energy you'd expect if they were lying.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together whether this person seems truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're smiling throughout, which feels natural—like they're genuinely engaged or comfortable with what they're saying, not forced or fake. And they're nodding a lot, which usually aligns with agreement or affirmation, kind of like they're reinforcing what they're saying. Their gaze is sideways a lot, not looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which I know some people do when they're thinking or recalling things, but I've also heard that avoiding eye contact can sometimes be a sign of discomfort. Still, I'm not sure if that's the case here—maybe they just have a habit of looking sideways when they're speaking, or it's cultural.  

The thing that makes me lean toward truthfulness is how relaxed they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no nervous gestures like rubbing hands or covering their mouth, and no awkward pauses where they're struggling to find words. They're just calmly speaking, smiling, nodding. That feels like someone who's not hiding anything, especially since they're not trying to overcompensate with extra movements. But then again, I've seen people who lie really smoothly—they don't always look nervous. Maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure, or maybe they've rehearsed what they're saying so well it doesn't feel like a lie to them.  

On the flip side, the sideways gaze is making me second-guess a little. If I were to guess, I'd say it's probably neutral—like they're just not used to direct eye contact, not necessarily a sign of lying. But I can't rule it out entirely. Sometimes people look away when they're fabricating something, but it's not a hard rule. And since they're smiling and nodding consistently, that feels more like a sign they believe what they're saying.  

Honestly, I don't think I'd call them a liar based on this. The cues seem to line up more with someone being truthful—smiling, nodding, no signs of stress. But I wouldn't stake my life on it either. It's possible they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just not the type to look people in the eye. My gut says they're being honest, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. It just doesn't feel like the kind of behavior that screams "lying" to me.

Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. The person seems pretty calm on the surface—no obvious smiles or laughter, which sometimes you see when people are trying to seem friendly while lying. But the thing that stood out to me was how often they raised their eyebrows, like that little flick-up of the brows, and then their gaze kept drifting down, not really meeting the camera directly for long. 

On the "maybe lying" side, I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes signal stress or trying to appear surprised when they're not, and looking down a lot is often linked to discomfort or avoiding eye contact, which people associate with deception. They were making eye contact sometimes though—gazing towards the person they're talking to—but then the downward glance felt a bit off. Like, they were trying to look engaged but kept looking away, which might mean they're not fully comfortable with what they're saying.

But then I started thinking, "Wait, maybe not." Because they weren't doing any of the classic 'lie signs'—no fidgeting with hands, no covering their mouth, no awkward pauses where their mouth was closed. In fact, they seemed pretty composed overall. And the fact that they were making eye contact when they looked up might actually suggest they're trying to seem truthful, not deceptive. Sometimes people who are nervous or lying *do* look away, but others might look down because they're just thinking hard or feeling shy, not because they're lying. Like, maybe they're just not a naturally expressive person, or they're in a situation where they're uncomfortable being filmed, not necessarily hiding something.

I also wonder about the context—what were they even saying? If it was a straightforward question about something neutral, like "What did you have for lunch?" then the behavior might just be normal nervousness. But if it was a loaded question about something sensitive, it'd be different. Without knowing that, it's really hard to tell. The raised eyebrows and downward gaze could be a mix of stress and trying to seem sincere, which is confusing. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward deception because of the combination of those subtle cues—especially the eyebrows and the gaze shifts—but I can't rule out that they're just naturally a bit anxious. I mean, I've seen people look down and raise their brows when they're just trying to remember something, not lie. It's tricky. I'd say it's probably deception, but I'm not 100% sure. There's enough to make me suspicious, but not enough to be certain. Like, it feels like a maybe.

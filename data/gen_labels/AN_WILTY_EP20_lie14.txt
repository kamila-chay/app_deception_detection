After watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't be entirely certain. They appear calm on the surface without the obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or awkward pauses, which could suggest they're composed. However, their frequent raised eyebrows—those quick flicks—and the way their gaze often drifts downward rather than holding steady eye contact makes me suspicious. Raised eyebrows can sometimes indicate stress or a forced expression of surprise, and looking down often correlates with discomfort or an attempt to avoid eye contact, both of which are commonly connected to deception. The fact that they occasionally make eye contact but then quickly look away creates a sense that they're trying to appear engaged but might be uneasy with what they're saying. Of course, it's possible they are just shy or thinking deeply, and without knowing the context of the conversation, it's hard to be sure. Nonetheless, given these subtle but suspicious cues, I am inclined to think they are probably being deceptive, even if there’s still a chance they’re simply anxious or reflective.

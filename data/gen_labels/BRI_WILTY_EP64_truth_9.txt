Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the only clear thing I notice is that they keep their palms facing up—like they're holding their hands out in a neutral, open way. I've heard that open palms can sometimes signal honesty or openness, like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything. But I also know that's not a hard rule; some people just gesture that way naturally, especially if they're calm or used to speaking with their hands.  

On the flip side, there's nothing obvious that screams "lying" here. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact (they seem to be looking straight ahead), no nervous blinking or tight lips. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe some of those little tells—like shifting in their seat or touching their face—but they're just sitting there, hands open, no big reactions. That makes me lean a bit toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure.  

Still, I keep thinking: what if they're just really good at hiding it? Like, maybe they're practiced at staying calm under pressure, so they don't show any signs of stress. Or maybe the open palms aren't about honesty at all—they could just be a habit, like how some people talk with their hands out when they're explaining something. Without more context, like what they're saying or the situation, it's hard to tell.  

Honestly, I'd probably say "truthful" based on what I see, but I'd also be cautious. It's not like they're giving a dramatic confession or anything—just a normal conversation with no red flags. But I wouldn't bet my life on it either. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I can totally see how someone else might think they're hiding something, especially if they're used to looking for more obvious signs. It's one of those cases where the absence of lies doesn't *prove* truth, but it sure makes it feel more likely.

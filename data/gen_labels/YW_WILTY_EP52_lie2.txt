Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, but honestly? It's kind of tricky. They're definitely making eye contact the whole time—staring right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of truthfulness to me. Most people who lie tend to look away or fidget, but they're not doing that here. Instead, they keep their gaze steady, which could suggest they’re telling the truth.

However, the head tilting and raised eyebrows stand out to me. Raised eyebrows can sometimes be a way to seem innocent or skeptical, almost like a “wait, really?” expression, and while head tilting might just be a sign of thinking or interest, it could also be a subtle, deliberate gesture. Sometimes people who are trying too hard to appear sincere might display these as unconscious tells.

On the other hand, there’s a notable absence of other signs—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses—which might point toward genuine engagement instead of deception. But then again, the calm demeanor and direct eye contact might also be part of a practiced composure to hide discomfort or dishonesty. If they were lying, I’d expect some nervous habit, maybe touching their face or shifting around, but none of that is present.

Since everyone is different, it’s possible those raised eyebrows and head tilts are natural for them or ways they handle nervousness. Still, given the mix of steady eye contact along with potentially deliberate facial expressions, I’m inclined to lean toward the idea that they might be masking something and possibly not being entirely truthful. I wouldn’t say it’s certain by any means, but overall, I lean a bit more toward deception than honesty here.

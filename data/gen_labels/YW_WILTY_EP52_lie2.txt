Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, but honestly? It's kind of tricky. They're definitely making eye contact the whole time—staring right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of truthfulness to me. Like, most people who lie tend to look away or fidget, but they're not doing that here. Instead, they keep their gaze steady, which makes me lean toward "they're telling the truth." 

But then there's the head tilting and the raised eyebrows—those are the only things standing out. I've heard people say raised eyebrows can mean they're trying to seem innocent or skeptical, like they're putting on a "wait, really?" face. And head tilting often happens when someone's thinking hard or trying to seem interested, not necessarily lying. I mean, I've done that myself when I'm listening carefully to someone, so it doesn't scream "deception" to me. 

On the flip side, though, maybe those gestures are a little *too* deliberate. Like, if they're trying to seem extra sincere, the raised brows and head tilt could be an unconscious tell. But honestly? The lack of other signs—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses—makes me think it's more likely they're just being engaged. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* nervous habit, like touching their face or shifting around. But they're just sitting there, nodding a little (wait, no, the label says no nodding, but they're still *there*, calm), looking straight at the other person. 

I guess the thing that keeps me from being sure is that everyone's different. Maybe for them, raising eyebrows is how they get nervous, or maybe they're just naturally expressive. I'd probably think they're telling the truth based on the eye contact alone, but I can't rule out that the other cues might mean something. Like, if I didn't know the context, I'd say "probably honest," but I'd still be a little unsure because you never know if someone's just really good at hiding it. Yeah, I'd lean truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Hard to say for sure without more to go on.

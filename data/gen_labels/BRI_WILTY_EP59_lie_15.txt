Watching this clip, I find myself leaning towards the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. While they maintain steady eye contact and don’t show the typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting or increased blinking, there is that subtle lip retraction that feels unusual. This slight tightening of the mouth could indicate they’re suppressing an emotional response, which is often linked to deception. 

Their gaze patterns—looking up or sideways while thinking—seem normal, which could suggest honesty, but these behaviors alone aren't conclusive. The fact that they stay composed and engaged might be a conscious effort to appear sincere. It’s possible the lip movement is just a natural quirk or a reflex, but combined with the other factors, it does raise some questions. 

Overall, while their outward demeanor points towards truthfulness, the odd lip retraction nudges me to suspect they might be holding something back. I can’t say for certain, but I’m leaning more towards the likelihood that they’re not telling the whole truth.

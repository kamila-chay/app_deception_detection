Watching this clip, I'm honestly a bit torn. At first glance, the person seems pretty composed—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me. They're not avoiding the gaze or fidgeting, which is what I'd expect if someone was nervous about lying. But then there's that moment where their lips pull back slightly, almost like they're tightening their mouth or trying to hold something in. It's subtle, but it stuck out to me. I've read that lip retraction can sometimes happen when people are suppressing an emotional reaction, like when they're trying not to smile or hide a grimace, which *could* be a sign of deception. 

But here's why I'm not totally convinced: their gaze patterns seem normal. They look up occasionally while thinking, and glance sideways a couple times—both of which are totally common when someone's trying to recall something or form an answer. I know some people think looking up means lying, but honestly, I've seen that in a lot of truthful conversations too. Plus, they're not blinking a lot, not scratching themselves, not avoiding eye contact at all. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "nervous" tells, like fidgeting or avoiding the gaze. 

On the flip side, maybe they're just naturally expressive with their mouth—some people do that when they're concentrating. Or maybe the lip thing was just a reflex, like they had a crumb or something. The fact that they're looking directly at the person they're talking to feels like a stronger indicator of truthfulness than that one subtle lip movement. Honestly, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure because that lip retraction *is* a bit odd. It's the kind of thing that makes you pause, but not enough to override the rest of their calm, engaged behavior. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably being honest, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or that tight-lipped look people sometimes get when they're trying to hide something. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which honestly makes me pause because I've heard people say raised eyebrows can mean surprise or skepticism, but it could also just be them processing the question or reacting to something unexpected in the conversation. They're also glancing sideways a few times instead of looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which *does* make me think, "Hmm, are they avoiding eye contact?" But then I remember how unreliable that is—some people just naturally look away when they're thinking, or maybe they're uncomfortable with direct stares for reasons unrelated to lying.  

What's interesting is how they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" you'd expect: no fake smiles, no forced laughter, no frowning, no lip biting, nothing like that. Their lips are just... kind of pushed out a little, which might be a neutral thing—like they're concentrating or maybe just have a habit of doing that when they're speaking. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact *entirely* (just glancing sideways) feels a bit more like someone who's just not super comfortable with the situation rather than someone actively trying to deceive.  

That said, I'm not totally ruling out lying. Maybe they're a really calm liar, or maybe the sideways glance is a deliberate tactic to seem less defensive. But honestly, the lack of other stress cues makes me lean toward them being truthful—like, if they *were* lying, I'd expect to see more of that "nervous energy" in their body language. Still, I know body language is super subjective, and I've been fooled before by people who seem totally chill but are hiding something. So yeah, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd be really cautious about being sure. It's one of those things where you just have to go with the vibe, and this vibe feels more "I'm just thinking" than "I'm making this up."

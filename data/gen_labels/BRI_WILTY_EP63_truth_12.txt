From what I can see in the video, the person is looking straight up at the ceiling or sky while they're speaking, and they don't seem to be doing anything else that stands out—no fidgeting, no obvious nervous ticks, no shifting eyes away. Honestly, that upward gaze is the main thing I notice. Now, I've heard that when people are trying to remember something real, they sometimes look up like that, almost like they're mentally searching their own memory. If they were making something up, I'd expect them to look down or away more, or maybe fidget, but they're just... still, looking up. That *feels* like they're actually thinking about what they're saying, not fabricating it. But then again, I'm not totally sure—maybe they're just used to looking up when they talk, or maybe they're trying to seem calm by avoiding eye contact, which could actually be a sign of lying. I've also read that some people do look up when they're lying, especially if they're rehearsing a story. The thing is, there's no other weird behavior to go on—no lip biting, no awkward pauses, no shifting around. So it's hard to say for sure. If I had to guess based on just this, I'd lean toward them being honest because the upward gaze without other stress signs seems more like genuine recall than deception. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it—people are complicated, and without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's really just a hunch. It could easily be the other way around.

Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. At first glance, the person seems a bit off—like they're frowning a little (lip corners down, yeah, that's noticeable), and their eyes keep drifting down or sideways instead of staying steady on the person they're talking to. That *does* make me think maybe they're not being fully straightforward, right? Like, when people lie, they often avoid direct eye contact or seem distracted. But then... wait, they *are* still looking at the interlocutor sometimes—like, "gaze towards interlocutor" is marked true—so it's not like they're completely avoiding eye contact. It’s more like they're glancing away while still engaging, which feels... weirdly natural for someone who's just uncomfortable, not necessarily lying. 

And here's the thing: there's no nervous energy. No fidgeting, no hands touching their face, no exaggerated blinking or lip biting. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of stress, like scratching their neck or shifting in their seat. But they're just sitting there, frowning, looking down sometimes, but not like they're panicking. The frown itself—could be sadness, or maybe they're just processing something heavy. Like, if someone's telling you bad news about a friend, they might look down and frown without lying. 

But then, counterargument: maybe they *are* lying, and they're just really good at hiding it. Some people don't show classic tells. The head turning sideways might be a way to avoid being caught, but it could also just be how they talk—like, they're thinking or gesturing naturally. And the "gaze down" could mean they're focused on their own thoughts, not hiding something. Honestly, the lack of physical tells is making me lean *away* from "lying" more than the frown or glance away. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, but this feels... quiet. Like they're just telling a hard truth, not making one up. 

I mean, I can't be 100% sure. It’s possible they’re lying and just very calm about it, but based on what I saw—no nervous gestures, still making some eye contact, just that low-key frown—it seems more like they're being honest but maybe upset or hesitant. So yeah, I’d probably guess truth, but I’d be second-guessing it for a while. It’s not the clearest clip, but it doesn’t scream "liar" to me.

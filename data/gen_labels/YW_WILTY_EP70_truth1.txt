Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I can see how someone might think otherwise. The person is looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like genuine engagement. If they were lying, I'd expect them to avoid eye contact more consistently, like looking away a lot or not meeting the gaze at all. But here, they're actually holding eye contact while occasionally glancing down—like they're processing what they're saying or thinking carefully. That downward gaze could make some people suspicious (like "oh, they're avoiding looking at me"), but it might just mean they're concentrating on their words, not hiding something.  

That head tilt to the side also feels natural, like they're nodding along or just shifting their weight comfortably, not nervousness. And the raised eyebrows? Could be surprise or emphasis, not a lie signal. The thing that makes me doubt it's a lie is how calm they seem—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no lip movements like biting or pursing (which people often do when lying). If they were fabricating something, I'd expect more of those little nervous habits.  

But I get why someone might question it. Gaze down *can* be a red flag for some, especially if they're used to seeing liars look away. And the head side-turn might seem like a subtle "I'm not sure" gesture. Still, the consistent eye contact with the other person feels more like someone who's being honest and just thinking through their answer, not someone trying to cover up. It’s not a perfect "truth" sign, but it’s the opposite of the classic "lying" behavior I’d expect. Honestly, I’d hesitate to say for sure, but based on what I’m watching, I’d probably guess they’re being truthful—though I’d want to hear the full context to be certain.

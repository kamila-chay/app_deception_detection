While it's difficult to be certain just from watching, the person's behavior in the video leans toward suggesting they might be lying. They display several signs that often correspond with deception: consistently raised eyebrows, noticeably frequent blinking, a tense and downturned mouth, and an averted gaze that mostly avoids direct eye contact. These behaviors together can indicate discomfort or nervousness commonly associated with dishonesty. The way their head tilts and their lips press tightly also reinforces the impression of tension, which might imply they are holding something back.

However, it's important to consider alternative explanations. Such signs could also stem from genuine stress or anxiety, like in a high-pressure situation, rather than intentional lying. The fact that they do make eye contact intermittently suggests nervousness more than outright avoidance typical of many liars. Their expressions might simply be their way of concentrating or coping with the moment rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive.

Still, the consistency and clustering of these nervous habits—repeated eyebrow raises, rapid blinking, tight mouth—make it less likely to be just casual nervousness. While it’s not conclusive, I tend to lean toward the interpretation that the person might be lying, though I wouldn't state it with absolute confidence. More context or information would be needed to make a firmer judgment, but based solely on the observed behavior, deception seems plausible.

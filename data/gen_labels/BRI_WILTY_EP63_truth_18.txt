Looking at the video, I’m trying to figure out if they’re being truthful or not. Honestly, it’s tricky because there’s not much to go on in terms of obvious signs. The person mostly keeps their gaze down—not looking at the camera or the person they’re talking to—and they don’t seem to be fidgeting at all. No blinking a lot, no shifting in their seat, no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiles. That’s interesting because when people lie, they often show more physical tension—like touching their face, avoiding eye contact, or having nervous tics. But here, they’re just… still. 

I’d lean toward them telling the truth because the lack of those typical "lie cues" is kind of telling. If they were making something up, I’d expect more of those little nervous habits, especially if they’re being questioned. But then again, I’ve heard that some people are just naturally calm under pressure—they don’t get flustered, so they don’t show those signs even if they’re lying. Maybe they’re just a quiet person, or maybe they’re thinking hard about what they’re saying, which is why they’re looking down. That could be genuine reflection, not deception. 

On the flip side, the fact that they’re avoiding eye contact *could* be a sign of lying, but I know that’s not always reliable. Truth-tellers look down too—like when they’re concentrating or being humble. And since there’s no other nervous behavior, it’s hard to say if that gaze is because they’re lying or just because they’re not the type to stare people in the face. I’d hate to jump to conclusions either way. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably being honest, but I wouldn’t bet money on it. It’s just… quiet, and that quietness feels more like calm than like a lie. But yeah, it’s not 100% clear.

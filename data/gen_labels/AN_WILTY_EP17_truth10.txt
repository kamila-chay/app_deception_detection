Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there aren't any obvious "lie signs" jumping out at me, but I also don't see the classic markers of someone being super relaxed and open. They're making steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so that feels like they're engaged, not avoiding. But then there's that head shaking, which I'd usually associate with disagreement or maybe even nervousness. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to shake their head "no" to something, but here it's just... shaking. It's hard to tell if it's a natural gesture or if it's masking something.  

The lips being protruded is interesting—people do that when they're thinking hard or slightly frustrated, not necessarily when they're lying. And they're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, not avoiding eye contact, which usually makes me lean toward truth. But I keep wondering: could that head shake actually be a sign they're trying to convince themselves or the other person? Like, maybe they're rehearsing what they're saying and the head movement is just a habit. I've seen people do that when they're being extra careful with their words.  

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—like frowning, lip biting, or looking away. But they're not doing any of that. The absence of those tells feels stronger than the head shake alone. Maybe the head shake is just how they talk, like when someone says "no" emphatically but it's not about deception. I'm not 100% sure, but the overall calmness, the direct gaze, and no other nervous habits make me lean toward them being truthful. Still, I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—because one gesture alone doesn't tell the whole story. But based on what I see here, I'd guess they're telling the truth, though I'd hesitate to say it's 100% certain.

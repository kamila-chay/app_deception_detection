Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. What stands out to me is how their eyebrows are raised—like they're caught off guard or trying to seem surprised—and their lips are pulled down at the corners, which feels a bit tense. They're also looking directly at the person they're talking to, not avoiding eye contact, but their gaze keeps flicking up like they're thinking hard. And they shrug once, which often feels like "I don't know" or "I'm not sure," but not necessarily lying.  

On one hand, those raised eyebrows and the downturned lips could be signs of stress or discomfort, which sometimes happens when people are being evasive. Gaze shifting up is a common cue in deception studies too—like they're fabricating something. The shrug might even feel like a nervous "I'm not hiding anything" gesture, which ironically can backfire.  

But here's where I hesitate: the lip corners down could just mean they're genuinely frustrated or annoyed about the topic, not lying. And they're making consistent eye contact, which usually points to truthfulness—not deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding the gaze, but they're pretty still otherwise. The shrug also feels natural, like they're just being casual, not trying to cover something up.  

Honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to say. Maybe they're just bad at handling pressure, or the question was personal and they're stressed. I'd lean toward "not lying" because the cues aren't super strong, but I wouldn't bet on it either. It's the kind of thing where I'd need more context—like, was it a simple yes/no question or something complicated?—to feel confident. Right now, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive, but it's just as likely they're just... not great at staying calm. I'm not sure, but it doesn't scream "liar" to me.

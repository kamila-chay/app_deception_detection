From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty calm and composed while speaking. They're actually making consistent eye contact with the camera (or whoever they're talking to), which is often a sign of someone being truthful—liars sometimes avoid direct gaze, but not always. They don't seem nervous either: no fidgeting, no exaggerated facial expressions, no rapid blinking, and their mouth stays relaxed without any awkward pauses. Their head turns slightly sideways a few times, but that just looks like a natural gesture when thinking or emphasizing something—not like they're hiding anything.  

That said, I wouldn't say it's *definitive*. Some people are just naturally good at staying calm when lying, or maybe they're just very practiced at this. The sideways head movement could also be habitual for them, not deceptive. And honestly, absence of "liar cues" doesn't *prove* truthfulness—sometimes truth-tellers get nervous too, but they don't show it the same way. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any of these classic signs, so I can't rule that out completely.  

Still, the way they're holding their gaze and not avoiding it feels more consistent with someone being honest. It's not like they're darting eyes or looking away constantly, which would raise red flags. But yeah, I'm not 100% certain—without knowing the context or what they're talking about, it's hard to say for sure. All I can go by is what I see, and right now, it leans more toward truth than deception, but I’d want more to be fully confident.

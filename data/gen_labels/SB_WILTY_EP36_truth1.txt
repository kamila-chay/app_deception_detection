Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm while speaking—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, weird facial expressions, or avoiding eye contact. They're actually making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to (that "gaze towards interlocutor" thing), which is a bit unusual for someone who's lying, since many people look away when they're not being truthful. But they also keep glancing down at their hands or the floor, which could be either them being thoughtful or trying to hide something. Their head is tilted sideways too, which feels relaxed—like they're listening or just in a natural, unforced state, not stressed or rehearsing. No excessive blinking, no lip movements, no hands covering their face... basically, nothing that screams "this person is lying."  

That said, I know some people are really good at hiding lies—they might not show classic signs like fidgeting, especially if they're practiced or just naturally calm. Maybe they're lying about something minor where they don't feel the need to act out, or maybe they're just shy and the down gaze is just how they talk. I've seen people who are totally honest but still look down when they're speaking, so it's not a sure thing. But honestly, the lack of *any* nervous tells here—no raised eyebrows, no awkward pauses, no defensive body language—makes it feel more likely they're being truthful. It's not 100% clear-cut, but if I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. Like, it feels... genuine? Not like they're putting on a show. But yeah, I could be wrong—sometimes the most convincing liars are the ones who look the most relaxed. Still, this seems more like someone who's just being themselves than someone trying to pull the wool over your eyes.

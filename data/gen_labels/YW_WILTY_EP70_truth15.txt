Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'm leaning toward them being truthful. The way they're gesturing feels pretty open—palms up, arms spread out like they're being straightforward, and they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to instead of avoiding eye contact. That's one of the things that usually makes me think someone's being honest, because liars often look away or seem distracted. They're also nodding along while speaking, which feels natural for someone agreeing or emphasizing a point, not like they're trying to fake sincerity.

But I'm hesitating a little because of the frequent blinking and raised eyebrows. I've heard people say those can be signs of stress or lying, like when someone's trying too hard to seem calm. If they were lying, maybe the blinking is from nervousness, and the raised brows could be an over-the-top attempt to seem engaged. I've seen videos where people do that when they're not being truthful. Still, there's no frowning, no lip biting, no head-shaking that feels dismissive—it's just a single head shake, which could just be a natural "no" or "wait" in conversation, not a lie signal. And they're not covering their mouth or touching their face, which are common when people are hiding something.

Honestly, the open body language (arms open, palms up) and direct gaze are so strong that they outweigh the blinking for me. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tells" like fidgeting or avoiding eyes, but they don't seem stressed—they look calm and engaged. It's tricky though, because sometimes people blink a lot when they're just tired or focused, not lying. I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're telling the truth than not. The other cues just don't line up with deception.

After watching the clip, I lean toward thinking the person might be lying, although I’m not completely certain. While they smile, maintain steady eye contact, and nod in a way that typically signals honesty, some of their facial expressions seem a bit exaggerated. Their wide-open eyes and highly raised eyebrows stand out as if they’re trying too hard to appear sincere or surprised. From what I’ve learned, people sometimes overplay these kinds of expressions when they’re not being truthful, almost like they’re faking enthusiasm or calmness. This forced quality feels like a subtle sign of deception.

That said, it’s possible they’re just naturally very expressive—some people do have those animated reactions without it meaning anything deceptive. Also, the absence of common nervous habits like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting does suggest some level of comfort or authenticity. Still, the exaggerated facial cues tip the scale a bit toward dishonesty in my mind. I wouldn’t be certain without hearing what they’re saying or having more context, but based on the body language alone, I lean toward the possibility that they’re not being entirely truthful.

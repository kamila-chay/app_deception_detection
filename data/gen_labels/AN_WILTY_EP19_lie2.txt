After watching the clip, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where the cues feel a bit mixed. On the surface, they're smiling, making direct eye contact, and nodding along, which usually makes me think someone's being genuine. Like, when people are telling the truth, they often relax into those natural expressions—smiling, looking at you, nodding like they're really listening. That part feels honest to me. But then there's this thing with their eyes: they're opening them super wide, like they're trying to look extra sincere or surprised, and their eyebrows are raised way up. I've read that sometimes when people are lying, they overdo expressions like that to seem more trustworthy, almost like they're faking enthusiasm. It feels a bit forced, you know? Like they're trying too hard to look calm and engaged.  

But here's where I second-guess myself: maybe they're just naturally expressive. Some people are just that animated—smiling a lot, wide eyes, raised eyebrows—without any ulterior motive. I've seen friends do that when they're excited about something, and it's totally normal. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting (no blinking, no hands moving around) also makes me think it might be genuine. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous tells, like looking away or fiddling with their hands.  

Honestly, I'm torn. The exaggerated eyes and eyebrows lean me toward deception, but the consistent eye contact and natural nodding push me the other way. I'd say it's probably a lie, but I wouldn't bet anything on it—I'd need more context, like what they're actually saying, to be sure. It's the kind of thing where you can't really tell from just the body language alone.

Looking at the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn. On one hand, they're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of openness—like they're not avoiding your gaze, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. Their arms are open too, which often signals someone trying to seem approachable or honest, like they're not hiding anything. And they're smiling with their lips turned up, which feels genuine at first glance. But then there's this weird mix with their eyebrows—they're both furrowed (frowning) and raised at the same time? That's the part that sticks out to me. I've heard that when people are lying, they sometimes force a smile while their eyebrows show tension or confusion, like their face isn't syncing up. It almost looks like they're trying too hard to seem friendly, but it's not quite landing right.  

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just genuinely stressed about the question, not lying. Like, maybe they're trying to be polite while they're actually thinking hard about how to answer, so the frown is from concentration, not deception. And the smile? Sometimes people smile when they're nervous but trying to keep it together—like they don't want to seem rude. I also don't see any classic "nervous" signs, like fidgeting, scratching, or avoiding eye contact, which makes me wonder if the mixed signals are just them being a little awkward, not deceptive.  

Honestly, I'm not sure. The eyebrow thing is really making me lean toward "maybe lying," but I keep second-guessing because it could just be their natural expression. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's *possible* they're not being truthful, but I wouldn't bet on it—there's too much that could be innocent. It feels like one of those moments where the behavior is ambiguous enough that you'd need more context to be confident. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel solid on this.

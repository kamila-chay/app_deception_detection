Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not—there are some things that make me lean toward deception, but other things that could just be them being genuinely upset or confused. Let me break it down as I'm watching: they're frowning a lot, especially with those eyebrows pulled down, and their head is shaking "no" pretty clearly while they're shrugging like they're saying, "I don't know, it's not my fault." Their eyes keep going down instead of meeting the other person's gaze, which I've noticed before can happen when someone's nervous or trying to avoid eye contact during a lie. But then again, I've seen people look down when they're just thinking hard or feeling bad about something—like if they're genuinely upset about the topic, not necessarily hiding the truth. The shrug especially feels like it could be a "I'm not responsible for this" gesture, which might be truthful if they're just being defensive, not deceptive. And honestly, the head shake isn't always a lie; sometimes people shake their heads "no" when they're just disagreeing with a question, not necessarily lying about facts. I keep wondering if they're just stressed or maybe the situation is making them uncomfortable—like, maybe they're telling the truth but they're frustrated with the whole conversation. Without knowing what they're being asked, it's tricky. The frown and downcast eyes *do* feel like classic signs of deception to me, but I've also seen people act that way when they're just tired or distracted. So yeah, I'm leaning toward it possibly being deception because of the head shake and the way they're avoiding eye contact, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It could easily be them being honest but just... not great at handling the conversation. I'd want to see more context before I'd feel confident either way.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's really hard to say for sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, the behavior feels a bit mixed, which makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not at all certain. They're smiling a bit with their lip corners up, which usually feels like genuine engagement, but then they have those frowning eyebrows and a slight chin lift—like they're holding something back or processing something heavy. The raised eyebrows and nodding make them seem attentive, like they're really listening to whoever they're talking to, which feels like it could be honest. Their arms are open too, which often signals openness, and they're looking directly at the person they're speaking to—no avoiding eye contact there, which sometimes people do when they're lying.

But then there's that exaggerated mouth opening, which stands out. I've heard some people say that when people lie, they might overdo expressions to seem more convincing, like stretching their mouth too wide. And the head moving backward a bit while they're talking—like pulling away slightly—could feel a little tense, which might hint at discomfort. I also notice they're looking down quite a bit, which some people do when they're being truthful (thinking it through), but others might do it when they're lying to avoid scrutiny. It’s really ambiguous.

On the flip side, if they were lying, the smile and nodding might be an attempt to seem friendly and cooperative, while the frowning and chin movement could be subconscious stress. But the fact that their gaze stays mostly on the other person, and they're not doing classic "lie cues" like covering their mouth or excessive blinking, makes me wonder if it's just them being thoughtful. Like, maybe they're trying to recall something accurately and it's making them frown a bit, not because they're hiding something. The head tilting sideways and nodding together feels natural, like they're genuinely considering what's being said.

I keep going back and forth because humans are messy—these cues don't always line up neatly. Some of this could just be their normal way of speaking or reacting. I’d be way more confident if they were doing something clearly inconsistent, like smiling while saying something sad, but here it’s all kind of... layered. I think I’d probably say they’re telling the truth just based on the lack of obvious red flags, but I’d still be cautious. It’s not like I can *prove* it, though. If I had to guess, I’d lean truth, but I’d definitely want more context to be sure.

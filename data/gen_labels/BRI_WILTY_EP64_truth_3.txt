Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video alone. From what I can see, the person's behavior seems pretty calm—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or fake smiles. They're actually looking up at the ceiling a bit while keeping their palms up and arms open, which feels like a relaxed, open posture. I've heard people say that looking up can sometimes mean someone's trying to remember something, which could go either way—truth-tellers might do it when recalling facts, and liars might do it when fabricating a story. But here, there's no other nervous energy: no rapid blinking, no lip biting, no shifting in their seat. Their arms are wide open, which usually signals honesty or openness, not deception.  

That said, I know some people fake "open" gestures to seem trustworthy while lying, so I can't rule that out entirely. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're rehearsed. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a hint of tension—like a slight scowl or fidgeting—but there's nothing like that here. The lack of those classic "liar tells" makes me lean toward truth, but honestly? It's not a slam dunk. Sometimes people are just weirdly calm when they're lying, or maybe they're just not the type to show stress. I'd say it's *more likely* they're being truthful based on this, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd be sure. Like, if they're describing a boring event, the calmness makes sense, but if it's something high-stakes, I'd be more skeptical. Right now, though, the behavior just doesn't scream "lying" to me.

Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. So, they're sitting there with a pretty serious expression—scowling, eyebrows furrowed, and they're raising them too, like they're skeptical or confused. Their chin is actually moving downward a bit, which feels like they're either frustrated or thinking hard. But here's where it gets tricky: they're looking straight at whoever's talking to them, which usually feels like someone being engaged, not hiding something. And their palms are up, open and flat, which people often do when they're being straightforward. 

But then there's the head shaking—like, they're shaking their head "no" while they're speaking. That's the part that makes me pause. Usually, when people shake their head while talking, it's to disagree or dismiss something, which *could* hint they're not being truthful. Like, maybe they're denying something they actually did. But... wait, maybe they're just disagreeing with what *was* said before, not necessarily lying about the current topic. I mean, it's not like they're avoiding eye contact or fidgeting like they're nervous—no blinking a lot, no hands covering their mouth, nothing like that. The palms-up thing feels like a strong sign they're trying to seem open, which truth-tellers often do. 

On the flip side, the scowl and frowning eyebrows might just mean they're upset about the situation, not lying. Like, maybe they're mad about the question being asked, not about the answer. And the head shake could just be a natural gesture—they might be saying "no" to a previous point, not denying the current statement. Honestly, the more I watch, the less sure I am. The "truth" cues (direct gaze, palms up) seem strong, but the head shake is throwing me off. I'd lean toward them being truthful because the other signs don't add up to deception, but I can see how someone else might read that head shake as a red flag. It's not a clear-cut case—like, it's the kind of thing where you'd probably need more context to be sure. I guess I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% certain. It's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're even talking about.

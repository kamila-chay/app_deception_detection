Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I'd be really hesitant to say for certain. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels natural, not forced. They're not avoiding the gaze or looking away a lot, which sometimes happens when people are uncomfortable. Their head is turning slightly sideways while they speak, but that seems like a normal conversational gesture, not something I'd immediately flag as nervous or deceptive—like when people tilt their head to listen or think. I also don't see any of the classic "tells" I've heard about: no fidgeting, no lip-biting, no exaggerated blinking, nothing that screams "they're lying."  

But here's where I hesitate: I know some people are really good at hiding their nerves, especially if they've practiced or are used to being in the spotlight. Maybe they're just calm by nature, or maybe they're so practiced at lying that they don't show any of these physical cues. The head turn could even be misinterpreted—like if they're trying to seem engaged, but it's actually a way to avoid direct eye contact while still appearing attentive. And honestly, the absence of "lying" signs doesn't *prove* truthfulness; it just means there's no obvious red flag.  

I guess what stands out most is how relaxed their posture feels. No crossed arms, no hands covering their face, no shifting around like they're uneasy. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little tension—like fidgeting or a slight hesitation—but here, they're just speaking steadily, looking at the person, and moving their head like anyone would in a normal conversation. So yeah, based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like truth than deception. But I'd still want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel fully confident. It's just... the behavior doesn't scream "lie" to me, and that's what I'm going with for now.

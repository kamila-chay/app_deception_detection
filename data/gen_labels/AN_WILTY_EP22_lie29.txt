Honestly, this is tricky to call just from the video alone—I'd want to hear the actual question and context to be sure. But based on what I'm seeing here, the person's behavior seems mostly neutral, which makes me lean toward them not lying, though I'm not 100% certain. The most noticeable thing is that raised eyebrow—they're not smiling or frowning, and they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which often feels more natural when someone's being truthful. People who lie sometimes avoid eye contact, but here they're looking right at the speaker, which could mean they're trying to seem credible. The lack of other nervous cues—like fidgeting, lip biting, or awkward pauses—also feels like they're relaxed, which makes deception less likely.  

But I can see why someone might think they're lying too. That eyebrow raise *could* be a sign of hesitation or stress—maybe they're trying to seem surprised or processing a tricky question, which sometimes happens when people are being evasive. And while direct gaze is often linked to honesty, I've heard that some skilled liars actually *over*-maintain eye contact to seem trustworthy, so it's not foolproof. Also, the fact that they're not smiling or showing other emotional reactions might feel "off" to some viewers, like they're holding back.  

Honestly? I think the strongest clue is the *absence* of classic deception signs. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or forced smiles. Here, they seem calm and engaged, which usually points to truthfulness. But I'd still be cautious—maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or the question was unexpected and that eyebrow was just genuine surprise. Without knowing what they're being asked, it's hard to say for sure. I'd probably say "not lying" based on this, but I'd want to hear the conversation to be confident.

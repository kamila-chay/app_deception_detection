Honestly, this is a tricky call based solely on the video—having the actual question and context would help a lot. However, from what I observe, there are subtle cues that make me lean slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive, though I wouldn’t say this with full confidence. The raised eyebrow stands out; while it could signal hesitation or stress, it might also suggest they're trying to mask uncertainty or discomfort. Their steady eye contact is interesting—it’s often a sign of truthfulness, but some skilled liars deliberately maintain strong eye contact to appear credible. The person’s neutral expression, neither smiling nor frowning, might feel a bit guarded or controlled, which could be an attempt to suppress genuine emotional reactions. 

While they don’t show classic nervous signs like fidgeting or lip biting, the absence of such cues doesn’t definitely rule out deception—some people manage to stay composed when lying. The calm and engaged demeanor could be a practiced front rather than genuine ease. So, although the behavior doesn’t scream “lying,” the combination of the eyebrow raise, careful eye contact, and neutral expression makes me lean toward the possibility that they might not be fully truthful. Without more context, it’s hard to say definitively, but I’d cautiously lean toward deception here.

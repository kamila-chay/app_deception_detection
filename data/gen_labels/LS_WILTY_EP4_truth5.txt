Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there are some behaviors that could go either way. On one hand, they're making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to—that's usually a good sign for truthfulness, since liars often avoid that. They're also nodding and turning their head sideways in a natural way while speaking, which feels like engaged conversation, not someone trying to hide something. The lips being protruded and the exaggerated eye closing catch my eye too—they look a bit tense or maybe even frustrated? But I'm not sure if that's because they're lying or just genuinely annoyed about whatever they're discussing.  

Then there's the hand stuff: rubbing, scratching, touching their head. Those are classic nervous tells people associate with lying, but I've seen so many people do that when they're just stressed or thinking hard, not necessarily when they're being deceptive. Like, I do it all the time when I'm trying to remember something. And the fact they're not smiling, laughing, or avoiding eye contact much makes me lean away from "lying" in this case.  

But wait—could those exaggerated eye closings be a red herring? Maybe they're just tired or blinking extra hard because of the lighting. And the sideways gaze... some people look sideways when they're being honest, especially if they're recalling something. I keep circling back to the eye contact being strong; if they were lying, I'd expect more of a downward or away glance. The head tilting isn't happening, which also feels more natural for someone being genuine.  

Honestly, the counterarguments are making me second-guess. The nervous fidgeting *could* be lying, but the lack of other "tells" (no scowling, no awkward pauses, no lip biting) makes me think it's just them being human. I'm not 100% sure—lying is super nuanced—but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It just feels... consistent, you know? Like they're not trying to hide anything, even if they're a little tense. But yeah, I'd be cautious—this stuff is never perfect. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

Hmm, this is tricky to assess just from the behavior described, since I'm not actually watching the video—but based on what I'm told about the actions, I'll try to think through it like I'm watching it unfold. So, the person has raised eyebrows and exaggerated eye opening, but nothing else that screams "lying" like frowning, avoiding eye contact, or nervous gestures. That's interesting because when people lie, they often show subtle signs—like fidgeting, avoiding gaze, or those little micro-expressions—but here, most of those are absent. The raised eyebrows could just be a natural reaction to something surprising they're saying, not necessarily deception. Like, maybe they're genuinely taken aback by their own story, or it's just how they express emphasis when they're being sincere. And that exaggerated eye opening... it feels a bit over-the-top, but it could just be their way of saying "I'm telling you the truth!" without any hidden meaning. Some people do that when they're trying to seem open and honest, even if they're not lying.

But then, I wonder—could that exaggerated eye thing be a red flag? Sometimes when people are lying, they overdo expressions to seem convincing, like "I'm not lying, look how open I am!" So that might actually tip it toward deception. Still, the lack of other classic signs—no lip biting, no awkward pauses, no shifting around—makes me lean away from that. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* nervousness, even if it's subtle. The fact that they're just... calm, with those specific reactions, feels more like someone who's either very confident in their truth or just naturally expressive. Like, maybe they're a person who always raises their eyebrows when they're serious, or they just have big eyes. I've seen people like that in real life—they don't need to fake it because they're not hiding anything.

On the flip side, though, if they're a practiced liar, they might suppress all the obvious tells, so the absence of behavior could mean they're good at lying, not that they're truthful. But the raised eyebrows and exaggerated eyes don't fit that "calm liar" profile—I mean, a good liar usually *avoids* drawing attention to themselves, not making their expressions more dramatic. So that feels like a mismatch. Honestly, I'm stuck between "this seems genuine" and "this might be an over-the-top attempt to seem genuine." But since the other signs (like frowning or avoiding eye contact) are missing, I'm more inclined to think they're telling the truth. It's not a slam-dunk, though—human behavior is messy, and one person's natural gesture might look suspicious to someone else. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but the evidence doesn't strongly point that way. If I had to guess based on what's here, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words they're saying to be sure. It's just... not screaming "liar" to me.

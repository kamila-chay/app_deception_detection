After watching the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t be entirely sure. The smile they have is subtle—lip corners up but not fully relaxed—which often can be a way to appear friendly or calm when someone is trying to hide something. On top of that, their chin juts out slightly and their head leans back while they look down and sideways instead of making direct eye contact. Those gestures often suggest discomfort or an attempt to create distance, which can be signs of deception.

While it’s true the smile could be genuine or just a polite reaction to an awkward situation, the lack of fidgeting doesn’t necessarily rule out lying. Some people manage to stay very still when they’re trying to keep a story straight, so that absence of nervous movements might not mean much. The head movement could be thoughtful rather than deceptive, but combined with the evasive gaze, it leans more toward hiding something.

Overall, I tend to think that there's a reasonable chance this person isn’t being completely honest, though I wouldn’t say it’s definite. There are signals pointing in that direction, but they could also be interpreted as signs of shyness or distraction. Without more context, I’d say the evidence slightly favors deception, but it’s still uncertain.

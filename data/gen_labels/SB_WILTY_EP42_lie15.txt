Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. The person is smiling a bit—lip corners up, not super wide, but there's definitely a smile. At first glance, that makes me think maybe they're being friendly or trying to seem calm, which sometimes people do when they're lying to seem less suspicious. But then I noticed their chin moving up a little, like they're jutting it out slightly, and their head is kind of leaning back while looking down and sideways—not at the person they're talking to. That feels a bit off, like they're creating space or avoiding eye contact, which I've heard can be a sign of discomfort or hiding something.  

But here's where I hesitate: the smile *could* just be natural. Maybe they're genuinely amused by something, or they're trying to be polite even if they're nervous. And they're not fidgeting at all—no blinking a lot, no hands moving around, nothing like that. Sometimes when people lie, they get really nervous and can't sit still, so the lack of that makes me wonder if it's actually stress from the situation, not deception. Like, maybe they're just in an awkward interview or something, and the smile is just their way of not seeming rude.  

The head moving back and tilting sideways too—I've seen people do that when they're thinking hard, not necessarily lying. It might just be how they process things. I mean, I'm not a lie detector, but the way they're looking down and away feels more like they're trying to think of a good answer rather than outright lying. But then again, when people lie, they often avoid direct eye contact, so that could line up.  

I guess I'm leaning a bit toward "maybe" they're not being 100% truthful, but I'm really not sure. It could easily be them just being a little shy or distracted. The smile is the confusing part—it's not a fake, forced grin, but it's not relaxed either. Like, it's there, but it doesn't quite match the rest of their body language. If I had to guess without any other context, I'd say it's possible, but not certain. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want to hear more of the conversation to be sure. Honestly, I wouldn't bet on it either way.

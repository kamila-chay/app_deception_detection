Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth based on what I'm seeing. The way they're looking directly at the person they're talking to—that steady gaze—usually makes me think they're being genuine. Liars often avoid eye contact, so that feels like a positive sign. Then there's the raised eyebrows and those exaggerated eye closings; I've heard that when people are recalling real memories, they sometimes do these little "processing" gestures, like closing their eyes to focus. It doesn't seem forced, more like they're actually thinking hard about what they're saying.  

But I can see why someone might think they're lying, too. That head shaking and the chin moving downward—those can look like defensiveness or even a "no" signal, which people associate with lying. And the lips retracted with a slight downturn, plus the mouth being closed during pauses... yeah, that could read as nervous or guarded. I mean, if they were lying, those might be signs of stress.  

Still, the awkward pauses with the mouth closed feel more like someone carefully choosing words to be accurate, not someone scrambling to make up a story. Liars often talk faster or fill silence with "um"s, but here it's quiet, deliberate. The head moving backward and the chin down might just be natural posture while thinking, not necessarily deception. Honestly, it's hard to tell without hearing what they're saying, but the overall vibe feels like they're being honest—they're not avoiding the interaction, and the little gestures seem like genuine thought, not rehearsed lies. I'd say truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It could be the pauses throwing me off, or maybe they're just a thoughtful person.

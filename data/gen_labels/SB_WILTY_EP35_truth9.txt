Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth. The way they're interacting feels... natural, honestly. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—looking directly at them, not avoiding it—and they're nodding along while speaking. That kind of active engagement usually makes me think someone's being genuine, especially since they're not fidgeting with their hands or covering their face. The head movements—tilting, turning slightly, moving backward a bit—just look like normal conversation gestures, not the nervous, stiff movements I've seen when people are trying to hide something.  

But here's where it gets tricky: they do have this exaggerated mouth opening, like they're really stressing a point, and their chin's moving up and down a lot. I've heard that exaggerated mouth movements can sometimes signal stress or overcompensation, which *could* hint at lying. And the frowning eyebrows and chin movements... well, those might just mean they're concentrating hard on what they're saying, not that they're lying. Maybe they're just passionate about the topic, or trying to be extra clear.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more classic signs—like avoiding eye contact, shifting their gaze a lot, or those little nervous ticks (rubbing hands, scratching). But they're not doing any of that. The fact that they're not smiling or laughing either feels odd for a lie; people often force smiles when they're being deceptive. So even though the mouth and chin stuff is a little weird, the overall calmness of their body language—no frantic energy, no signs of discomfort—makes me think they're just being earnest.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context. Maybe they're just a very expressive person, or maybe they're genuinely upset about whatever they're talking about, which would explain the frown and the chin movement. I wouldn't rule out the possibility they're lying, but based on what I see here, the absence of the usual "lie signs" tips the scale toward truth. It just doesn't *feel* like deception to me.

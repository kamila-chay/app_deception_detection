Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but here's how I'm thinking about it after watching the clip. The person seems pretty engaged—they're looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which usually feels like someone trying to be honest. Their palms are up, which often reads as open or non-threatening, and they're raising their eyebrows a bit, like they're processing something or maybe even surprised by the question. That kind of eyebrow movement can happen when someone's genuinely thinking, not necessarily when they're lying.  

But then again, I've seen people raise their eyebrows on purpose when they're trying to seem innocent, like they're overcompensating. And the palms up thing... sometimes people do that when they're trying *too* hard to look trustworthy. I didn't see any obvious signs of lying either—no avoiding eye contact, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses. If they were really lying, I'd expect more nervous habits, like touching their face or looking away more. But then, maybe they're just really calm under pressure?  

The thing that sticks with me is how steady they are. No sweating, no shifting in their seat, just that one moment of raised eyebrows while keeping eye contact. It feels... intentional, but not in a way that screams "deception." Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect them to seem a little more tense. But honestly, I'm not ruling out the possibility either. People lie in all sorts of ways—some are super smooth.  

All in all, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just because they don't seem *off* in the way liars often do, but I'd want more context to be sure. It's not a clear-cut "yes" or "no," and I wouldn't bet my reputation on it. If I had to guess right now, I'd say it feels more like truth than deception, but I'm not confident.

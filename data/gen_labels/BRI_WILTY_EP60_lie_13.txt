Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not 100% sure. The person seems pretty engaged with the interviewer at first glance—they're making direct eye contact most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But then there's this thing where they keep raising their eyebrows a bit, like when they're processing something tricky. It's not a big, dramatic raise, just a subtle lift. And sometimes, especially when they're answering, their eyes flick sideways for a second before going back to the interviewer. I've seen people do that when they're thinking hard, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're trying to remember a detail or formulate the answer.

On the flip side, the lack of other classic "lying" cues is interesting. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact entirely, no nervous laughter or smiling. If they were really trying to cover something up, I'd expect more of that physical tension. The eyebrow raise *could* be a sign of deception—sometimes people do that when they're preparing a false answer—but it's also super common when someone's genuinely surprised or skeptical about a question. Like, if the interviewer asked something unexpected, that little eyebrow lift might just be "Wait, what?" instead of "I'm lying."

I guess the sideways glance is the part that sticks with me. It feels a bit off, but I keep wondering if it's just how they naturally look when they're concentrating. People have all sorts of little habits—maybe they just tend to glance away when thinking, and it's not related to deception at all. Without knowing the context of the question, it's really hard to say. If the question was something like "Did you see the car crash?" and they looked sideways while answering, that might feel more suspicious. But if it's a neutral question, it could be nothing. Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'm not confident. It's one of those moments where you just can't tell from the video alone. The behavior isn't screaming "deception," but it's not a clear "truth" either. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel comfortable guessing.

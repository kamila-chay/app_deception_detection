Hmm, this is a tough one. I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure. Let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person seems to be responding to a question, and their face is pretty expressive. They're not smiling or laughing at all, which is interesting—sometimes people fake smiles when lying, but here they're not. Instead, they've got this weird mix of frowning *and* raising their eyebrows at the same time. It looks like they're trying to look surprised or skeptical, but the frown underneath makes it feel tense, like they're forcing it. Then there's the head shaking—definitely a clear "no" motion while they're talking. That feels like a strong signal, but I'm not sure if it's related to the question or just a habit. Their gaze is locked on the person asking, which usually leans toward honesty, but the head shake is really pulling me the other way. Oh, and they have their palms up, which often signals openness or honesty, but that's kind of contradicted by the head shake. 

On the other hand, maybe they're just naturally expressive—some people have those eyebrow quirks, and the head shake might just be a nervous tic unrelated to lying. The lack of awkward pauses or forced smiles also makes me think they might be genuine. But the conflicting signals—frowning while raising eyebrows, shaking head while showing palms up—feel like they're trying too hard to seem neutral or open, which sometimes happens when people are covering something up. I'm really torn because the direct gaze is reassuring, but the head shake and the eyebrow tension are throwing me off. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward deception because the head shake is such a strong, intentional gesture, and it doesn't match the open palms. But I'm not confident at all—maybe they're just frustrated with the question, not lying. It's hard to say without more context, and I'd want to see the whole conversation to be sure. Honestly, I'd probably ask for more footage before I'd feel solid on this one.

Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video, but I'll try to walk through what I'm seeing. So, the person seems to be looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is marked as true—and they're not avoiding eye contact, which honestly feels like a good sign for truthfulness. Liars often look away or fidget, but here they're holding steady eye contact. I also notice they're turning their head slightly sideways a few times, which isn't a classic "lying" cue—it could just be them thinking or emphasizing a point, not necessarily nervousness.  

But wait, there's that frowning eyebrows thing. It's a bit odd—they're not smiling or laughing at all, and the eyebrows are scrunched down. That *could* mean they're uncomfortable or even lying, right? Sometimes people frown when they're trying to remember something or feeling stressed about the truth. I've seen that happen with people who are being honest but just genuinely frustrated about the topic.  

On the other hand, they're not doing any of the obvious "liar tells" like covering their mouth, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting with their hands. No awkward pauses either, and they're not exaggerating their expressions. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* of those signs, especially since they're not smiling at all—truth-tellers can still have neutral or even slightly serious expressions when being factual. The head tilt is minor and doesn't seem forced, so that doesn't jump out as deceptive.  

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful just because the eye contact feels so consistent and natural. The frown is throwing me off a little—maybe they're just concentrating hard or the question was annoying them—but the lack of other red flags makes me think it's not deception. Still, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe they're a really calm liar who doesn't show typical signs, or maybe that frown is just them being thoughtful. I'd want to hear more of the conversation to be certain, but based on what I see, I'd guess they're telling the truth. It just doesn't feel like the nervous, rehearsed vibe you'd get from someone lying.

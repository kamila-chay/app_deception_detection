Hmm, this is tricky to call just based on the video alone. I'm watching someone answer a question, and they're definitely looking right at the person asking it—like, really steady eye contact, which usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, right? But then they keep raising their eyebrows, kind of like they're skeptical or surprised by the question itself, not necessarily nervous. And they're nodding along while they talk, which feels like they're processing or agreeing, but I'm not sure if that's normal or if it's a bit too consistent for someone being honest.  

On one hand, they don't seem fidgety at all—no blinking too much, no hands moving around, no avoiding eye contact—which is what most people expect from liars. If they were lying, I'd maybe expect some of those signs, like shifting in their seat or looking away. But then again, I've heard that some really practiced liars don't show those classic cues at all—they might even overdo the eye contact to seem sincere. And the eyebrow thing? Could just be them genuinely reacting to the question, like "Wait, are you serious?" instead of hiding something.  

On the other hand, the steady gaze and nodding feel a bit *too* controlled. Like, if they were telling the truth, maybe they'd have a little more natural variation in their expression—like a smile or a slight head tilt if they're relaxed. But here, it's all very focused, almost like they're rehearsing. Still, I can't rule out that they're just a calm person who doesn't get flustered easily.  

Honestly, I'm stuck between two possibilities. If I had to guess, I'd say it's more likely they're being truthful because the lack of nervous tells is pretty strong evidence for that. But I'm not at all confident—some people lie without a single flicker of doubt, and others get nervous even when they're telling the truth. The eyebrow thing throws me off; it doesn't *feel* like deception, but it's not a clear sign of honesty either. Maybe it's just their normal way of talking. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel sure. For now, I'd lean toward "truthful" but with a big "maybe" attached.

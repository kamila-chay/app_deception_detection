Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and steady while speaking. They're maintaining direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to—no looking away or avoiding the gaze—which often makes me think someone's being straightforward. Their face is pretty neutral too; no big smiles, frowns, or sudden expressions that might signal discomfort. They're not fidgeting with their hands or touching their face, which are things I've noticed people do when they're nervous or trying to hide something. The way they're sitting or holding their head—no tilting, no shaking—feels relaxed, like they're just focused on what they're saying.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. I know some people are just naturally calm under pressure, so even if they were lying, they might not show obvious signs. Like, maybe they've practiced this before, or they're just not the type to get flustered. I've also heard that some skilled liars actually *do* keep steady eye contact to seem credible, so it's not a perfect sign. And honestly, the absence of nervous habits doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth—it just means they're not acting like they're hiding something.  

But overall, the way they're speaking with steady eye contact and no physical tells leans me toward thinking they're being honest. It feels like they're just calmly sharing their story without any tension. Still, I'd want to hear more context or see if other parts of the conversation match up before I'd be completely certain. For now, based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're telling the truth, but I'm not ruling out the possibility they're just really good at staying calm.

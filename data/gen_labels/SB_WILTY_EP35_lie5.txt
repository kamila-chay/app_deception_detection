Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone answer a question, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. What stands out most to me is how they're keeping their eyes downcast the whole time—like they're staring at the floor or their hands instead of looking at whoever's asking. They also have this tight frown on their face, eyebrows kind of knotted together, and they keep turning their head sideways a bit, like they're avoiding direct eye contact. Those things *do* make me lean toward thinking they might be hiding something, because when people are being deceptive, they often avoid eye contact or seem tense like that. The frown especially feels off—like they're really concentrating hard on not giving something away.

But then I keep second-guessing myself because it could totally be something else. Maybe they're just really upset about what they're talking about? Like, if someone's sharing bad news or feeling embarrassed, they might look down and frown without lying. I've seen people do that when they're trying not to cry or just feel awkward. And the head turning—could be a nervous habit, or maybe they're just uncomfortable in the setting, not necessarily lying. Also, they're not smiling or laughing at all, which is interesting because liars sometimes force smiles to seem casual, so the *absence* of that might actually point to them being genuine. Like, if they were trying to cover up a lie, I'd expect more of a "too-perfect" smile. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The cues are there for deception, but they're not super clear-cut. It feels more like they're just stressed or uncomfortable with the question, not actively trying to trick anyone. I'd say I'm leaning slightly toward "not lying" because of how natural the frown seems—like it's part of the emotion they're expressing, not a fake mask—but I'm not confident at all. There's just not enough to rule out deception entirely either. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably truth with some anxiety, but I'd need more context to be sure. It's one of those moments where the behavior could go either way.

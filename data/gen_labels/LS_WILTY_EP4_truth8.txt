Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or telling the truth, but it feels more like they're being honest. I notice they're not smiling or laughing, which I'd expect if they were trying to be charming or cover up something. Instead, they keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like they're genuinely surprised or processing what they're saying—and they blink frequently. That could be nervousness, but it also happens when people are just thinking hard, especially when they're trying to be clear. Their chin actually moves up a little when they speak, which I've heard some people do when they're being sincere, like they're leaning in to be heard. They also keep looking directly at the person they're talking to, which usually means they're engaged, not hiding something. 

But I can see why someone might question it too. The sideways glance and head turning a bit to the side could feel like they're avoiding eye contact, which people sometimes do when lying. And the frequent blinking definitely makes me wonder if they're stressed about what they're saying. I've read that liars might blink more, but I also know it's not a sure thing—it could just be they're tired or the lighting is bothering their eyes. 

The thing that leans me toward truth, though, is that they don't have any of the classic "lie signs" like frowning, touching their face, or crossing their arms. If they were making it up, I'd expect more of those defensive gestures. They're just sitting there, talking straightforwardly, with their head up and eyes mostly on the other person. It doesn't *feel* like deception to me, but I'm not 100% certain. Sometimes people who are truthful get nervous and do the same things as liars, so it's hard to say for sure. Honestly, based on what I see, it seems like they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to hear more context before I'd bet on it.

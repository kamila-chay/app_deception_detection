Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is how they're holding their gaze—directly at the camera the whole time, no looking away. That usually makes me lean toward truth, since people who lie often avoid eye contact or glance around. They also have their palms facing up, which I've heard some people say is a sign of openness or honesty, like they're not hiding anything. And their head movements—nodding slightly while moving it forward and back—seems natural, like they're engaged in the conversation, not fidgeting nervously. 

But then I keep thinking, "Wait, is that really reliable?" Because head shaking can mean agreement in some contexts, not just denial, and maybe they're just a very expressive person. Also, palms up isn't a foolproof sign—some people just hold their hands like that naturally, especially if they're trying to seem calm. I don't see any classic "lying" tells either: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird smiles or forced pauses. The absence of those things makes me think they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. Like, maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just nervous in a way that doesn't show through those specific cues. 

Honestly, the more I watch, the less I see anything that screams "lying" to me. It feels like they're just being straightforward, but I can't rule out that they might be lying while still looking calm. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying, but based on the behavior alone, I'd guess truth more than lies. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel confident about it. You know how it is—sometimes people look calm but are lying through their teeth. But in this clip? I'm leaning toward truth, just not *certain* truth.

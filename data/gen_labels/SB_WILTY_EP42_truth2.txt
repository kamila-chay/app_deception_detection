Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I'd hesitate to say it's definite. The way they're looking away a lot—down and sideways—makes me think they're not trying to lock eyes with the camera, which sometimes happens when people are focused on recalling details instead of crafting a story. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to maybe avoid eye contact more intensely or fidget, but they're not doing that. No raised eyebrows? Wait, no, they *are* raising their eyebrows a bit—like, when they say something, their brows go up slightly. That feels genuine, like they're surprised or emphasizing a point, not like a nervous tic. And they're not touching their face or fidgeting with their hands at all, which is interesting because liars often do that.  

But then again, I could be wrong. Some people who lie look away too, especially if they're trying to seem calm or if they're used to lying. And that sideways head tilt—could be nervous, or it could just be how they naturally move when they're thinking. I've seen truth-tellers do the same thing when they're trying to remember something. The lack of smiling or laughing also feels neutral—not like they're hiding anything, but it's not a strong "truth" sign either. Honestly, the most I can say is that the behavior *doesn't scream deception* to me. It feels like someone who's just being quiet and thoughtful, not like they're trying to cover up something. But I'd still want to hear more context before I'd be confident. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the question they're answering, though.

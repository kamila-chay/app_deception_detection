Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what stood out to me while watching. The person was maintaining eye contact the whole time—which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me, since liars often avoid direct gaze. But they were blinking way more than usual, like almost constantly, and that made me pause. Frequent blinking can be nervousness, but it's not a dead giveaway for lying—it could just be dry eyes or general anxiety about the topic.  

Then there was this odd mix with their head movements: they kept nodding (like agreeing) while also shaking their head (which usually means "no"). It felt a bit conflicting, like they were trying to say something but getting tangled up. I wondered if they were rehearsing a response or struggling to stay consistent. But then I noticed their arms were wide open the whole time—no crossed arms, no defensive gestures. Open arms usually signal comfort or sincerity, which feels at odds with deception. If they were lying, I'd expect them to close off physically, not stay so relaxed.  

On the flip side, the lack of smiles or frowns felt a bit stiff. People often show subtle emotions when they're nervous or hiding something, so not reacting at all made me question if they were forcing calm. But then again, maybe they're just naturally reserved or focused on answering accurately.  

I guess the blinking and head confusion nudge me toward "maybe lying," but the open posture and steady eye contact make me lean away from it. Honestly, it’s really hard to tell—I’d probably need more context, like what they were being asked about. If they were answering a simple question calmly with that open body language, I’d probably trust them more. But with the blinking and mixed head signals, I’m not ruling out nervousness or even a truthful person who’s just really flustered. I’d say it’s a maybe, but I’d hesitate to call it a lie without more to go on.

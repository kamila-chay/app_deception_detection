Honestly, watching this clip, I'm not totally sure, but I lean toward them telling the truth. The way they're looking directly at the person they're talking to while nodding feels pretty engaged—like they're actually listening and agreeing with what's being said, not just waiting for a chance to speak. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which could mean they're surprised or processing something, but not necessarily nervous about lying. And they're not avoiding eye contact, which is one of those classic "liar" tropes people expect, but honestly, I've seen a lot of truthful people do that too when they're just focused on the conversation.

That said, I can see why someone might be skeptical. The lips pulled back a little—like they're tensing their mouth—could look like they're holding something in, maybe trying to keep a straight face if they're lying. And raised eyebrows sometimes happen when someone's trying to seem sincere, like they're overcompensating. If I were really trying to spot a lie, I'd probably look for more obvious signs: like them fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or giving a fake smile. But here, they're just... nodding and looking at the other person, which feels pretty natural for someone who's actually talking about something they know.

The thing is, the absence of "lying" cues is kind of telling. If they were making it up, I'd expect more signs of stress—like fidgeting, looking away, or maybe even a forced laugh. But they're not doing any of that. They're calm, they're making eye contact, and they're nodding along. It just doesn't feel like the kind of behavior that screams "I'm lying." But I'm not gonna say for sure—people lie in all kinds of ways, and some are really good at hiding it. Still, based on what I see, it seems more likely they're being honest than not. It’s not perfect, but it’s the best I can tell from the video alone.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty still overall—not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact much, which makes me lean toward them being genuine, but I'm not 100% sure. They're looking at the person they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor), which is a good sign—liars often avoid direct eye contact, but here they're not doing that. Instead, their eyes are down a bit, and they've got their chin moving down slightly, like they're sighing or thinking hard. Their lips are pulled down, and eyebrows are raised and furrowed, which feels like they're genuinely upset or frustrated about whatever they're saying, not trying to hide something. 

The body language stands out to me: palms up and arms open are classic "I'm being honest" signals—like they're showing their hands empty, not hiding anything. No nervous touches, no blinking a lot, no fake smiles. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, like scratching or fidgeting, but they're pretty calm in that way. It feels like they're just processing something heavy, which would make them look sad or tense, not deceptive. 

But then I second-guess myself: maybe the downward gaze *is* a sign of lying? Sometimes people look down when they're making something up, right? And the frowning—could that be a mask for guilt? But the open posture and lack of other nervous habits makes me doubt that. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical tension, like their hands moving or shoulders hunching, but they're relaxed in that way. The head side-turning feels like a natural gesture, not a tell. 

Honestly, the more I watch, the more it seems like they're just being honest about something tough. The sadness in their face lines up with being truthful about a hard topic—like if they're sharing bad news, they wouldn't fake a smile or avoid eye contact. It’s the opposite of how I'd picture a liar acting. But I can't rule out that the frown might just be from stress, not deception. Still, the absence of "lying" cues feels stronger to me than the few ambiguous ones. I’d lean toward truth, but I’d want to hear the actual words to be sure—sometimes context changes everything.

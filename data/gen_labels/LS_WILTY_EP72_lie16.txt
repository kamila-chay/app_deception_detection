Looking at this clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit confusing because they don't seem to be doing any of the classic "tells" people expect when someone's lying—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or looking away a lot. In fact, they're actually looking right at the camera the whole time and even have that slight upward gaze, which I've heard some people say means they're thinking or recalling something, not necessarily lying. 

What stands out to me is that single shrug they did. I've seen people shrug when they're unsure or trying to say "I don't know," which could go either way—maybe they're being honest about not knowing, or maybe they're trying to seem casual to cover up a lie. But here's where I'm second-guessing: they didn't seem nervous at all. No rapid blinking, no lip biting, no fidgeting with their hands. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a little more tense, but they just seemed calm and direct. 

On the flip side, though, I know some people are really good at hiding lies—they don't look away or fidget because they've practiced it. So that calmness might actually be a red herring. The shrug is the only thing that feels off, but shrugs can mean so many things—disbelief, uncertainty, even just a habit. I keep going back to the eye contact: they were looking right at the camera the whole time, which usually makes me lean toward truthfulness because liars often avoid direct gaze. But I've also heard that some liars *over*-compensate by staring too hard. 

Honestly, I'm stuck. The lack of obvious nervousness makes me think they might be telling the truth, but the shrug and the upward gaze leave me wondering if they're just being extra careful. If I had to guess right now, I'd say it's more likely they're being honest—because they don't seem like the type who'd get flustered if they were lying—but I wouldn't bet my life on it. There's just not enough clear evidence either way. Maybe they're just a naturally calm person. I'd need to see more context to be sure.

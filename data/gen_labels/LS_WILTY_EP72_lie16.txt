Looking at this clip, I'm leaning toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful. While they don't display the classic signs of lying like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or looking away, their steady gaze and slight upward look, which can indicate thinking, might also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere. The shrug they do catches my attention—often a sign of uncertainty or hesitation—which in this case could suggest they're trying to mask some doubt or a cover-up rather than outright admitting ignorance.

What’s more curious is their calmness. You’d expect at least a bit of nervousness if someone were lying—rapid blinking, lip biting, or restless hands—but this person remains unusually composed, which might actually point to practiced deception rather than honesty. Some liars get really good at appearing calm to avoid suspicion, so their steadiness could be more of a red flag than a green one.

The fact that they maintain direct eye contact makes me hesitate because typically liars avoid looking someone in the eye. However, some do the opposite, overcompensating by staring intently to sell their story, and this could be what’s happening here. Given the shrug, the unusual calmness, and the intent gaze, I find myself leaning toward the suspicion that they might be lying—though I wouldn’t say this is certain. There isn’t enough definitive evidence, but overall, I’m inclined to believe there’s some level of deception going on here.

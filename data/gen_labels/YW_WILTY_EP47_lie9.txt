Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those cases where the cues feel a bit mixed up. They're laughing a bit, which usually makes me think they might be trying to seem relaxed or friendly, but it's not a full, genuine laugh; it feels a little forced, like they're chuckling to cover something. Then there's the frown—eyebrows are really pulled down, which usually means they're uncomfortable or frustrated, but I wonder if that's just because they're annoyed about the question, not necessarily lying. Their mouth is pulled up at the corners (like they're smiling), but their eyes don't really light up, so it might be a polite or awkward smile rather than a happy one.

What stands out more is how they're looking. They keep glancing sideways instead of meeting the person's eyes directly, and they're turning their head to the side a lot while talking. That often makes me think someone's avoiding eye contact because they're not being truthful, but I've seen people do that just because they're shy or distracted, not because they're lying. They're also shaking their head a few times while answering, which usually means "no" or "I disagree," but it could just be a nervous habit or them emphasizing a point. The sideways gaze and head turns feel like they're trying to create distance, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something, but it's not a clear red flag on its own.

On the other hand, they do keep looking at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor is true), which feels like they're trying to engage, so maybe they're not avoiding it entirely. And the laughter—while it's a bit off—could just be them trying to ease tension, especially if the topic is awkward. I've known people who laugh nervously when they're actually being honest but just feel put on the spot. The frown might just be them concentrating hard or upset about the situation, not deception.

Honestly, it's tricky. The evasion cues (sideways look, head turn) lean toward deception, but the other behaviors don't strongly support it. It could be they're genuinely stressed about the question, not lying. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive, but I wouldn't bet on it—it feels like they might just be uncomfortable or flustered. I'd want to see more of the context or hear the actual conversation before I felt confident either way. It's not the clearest case I've seen.

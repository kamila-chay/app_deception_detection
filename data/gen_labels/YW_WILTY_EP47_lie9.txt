Based on the video, I lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, although it's not entirely certain. Their laugh seems somewhat forced, as if they're trying to appear relaxed or friendly while possibly concealing something. The pronounced frown with pulled-down eyebrows usually signals discomfort or frustration, which could be related to annoyance with the question, but it might also hint at some level of deception. Their smile doesn't quite reach their eyes, suggesting it might be more of a polite or awkward smile rather than a genuine one.

What draws attention most is their tendency to glance sideways and turn their head frequently while speaking. These behaviors often suggest someone is avoiding direct eye contact, which can be a sign of dishonesty, though it might also be due to shyness or distraction. The head shaking while answering can mean disagreement, but might also be a nervous habit. Overall, the sideways looks and head turns seem like attempts to create distance, which can indicate hiding something, even if it's not an outright red flag on its own.

While they do maintain some gaze toward the person they're speaking with, which indicates an effort to engage, it doesn’t fully counterbalance the evasive cues. Their laughter could be an attempt to ease tension rather than a sign of honesty, since nervous laughter can occur both when people lie or when they are simply uncomfortable. The frown might be from concentrating or being upset, but combined with the other signs, it adds to the uncertainty.

In sum, the evasion cues make me lean toward the possibility that this person is not being entirely truthful, though it’s not definitive. They might just be uncomfortable or flustered, but given the combination of forced laughter, evasive glances, and head turns, deception seems more likely than not. Without more context or the full conversation, it’s hard to be completely sure, but my impression is that they are probably not telling the whole truth.

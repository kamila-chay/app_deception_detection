Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels more natural when someone's being genuine—like they're actually listening and engaged. They're also nodding along while speaking, which often matches what they're saying rather than seeming forced. I noticed they raised their eyebrows a couple times too, but that could just be surprise or emphasis, not necessarily a sign of lying. Their head turns slightly to the side a few times while talking, but that seems like a natural gesture when thinking or agreeing, not something I'd immediately flag as deceptive.

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Raised eyebrows *can* sometimes signal hesitation or even deception in certain contexts, though it's not a sure thing. And the head turning—while probably harmless—might make a skeptical viewer wonder if they're avoiding direct eye contact (though they're actually looking at the person most of the time). Also, I don't see any obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding gaze, or nervous laughter, which often go with lying. But it's hard to rule out completely—maybe they're just naturally expressive or really calm under pressure. I've seen people who lie well without those classic cues, and others who seem nervous about something unrelated, like just being on camera. Honestly, without more context, it's tough to say for sure. But based on what I'm watching, the absence of those "red flag" behaviors, plus the steady eye contact and nodding, makes me think they're probably being honest. Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it—deception can be subtle.

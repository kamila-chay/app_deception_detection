Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because their body language doesn't scream "deception" in the obvious ways I'd expect. They're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze toward the interlocutor is solid, which usually leans toward honesty, right? And their arms are open, not crossed or defensive, which feels like they're trying to seem approachable or genuine. Plus, their head's tilted a bit, but that could just be thoughtful, like they're really listening or processing what they're saying, not necessarily nervousness. I don't see any of the classic "tells" either—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed, no excessive blinking or shifting around. That's actually kind of unusual for someone who might be lying; most people I've seen fidget or avoid eye contact when they're not being straight with someone.

But then again, I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Maybe the head tilt is a subtle sign of deception in this context? I've heard some people say tilting the head can sometimes be a way to seem more "trustworthy" while lying, like they're trying to soften their expression. And it's possible they're just really calm or practiced at lying—some people don't show obvious signs at all. The open arms and steady gaze could even be a deliberate tactic to seem honest, not a natural sign. Like, maybe they've been coached to keep their posture relaxed while lying. 

Honestly, the lack of nervous behavior is making me lean toward them being truthful, but I can't rule out that they're just good at hiding it. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little more tension—like fidgeting or a slight shift in their gaze—but they seem pretty composed. Still, the absence of "tells" doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth, just that it's not obvious. I guess my gut says they're probably being honest, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation to be sure. It's hard to say for certain just from the body language alone—sometimes the quietest people are the ones hiding something.

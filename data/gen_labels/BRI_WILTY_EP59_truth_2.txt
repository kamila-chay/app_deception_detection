Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while answering. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever's asking them questions—looking right at them, not avoiding it—and their eyes move up and sideways a bit, which often happens when someone's trying to recall details, not when they're fabricating something. I don't see any of the usual nervous tells like fidgeting, covering their mouth, or over-the-top smiling. The eyebrows are raised, which might just be them reacting to the question with genuine surprise or thought, not necessarily stress from lying.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Raised eyebrows can sometimes be a sign of tension too, especially if they're trying to seem calm. And the sideways glances could look like they're avoiding eye contact, but I think it's more likely they're just thinking or processing the question, not hiding something. Truth-tellers often have those natural pauses and subtle head movements—like glancing away while they gather their thoughts—whereas liars might stare too intensely or have rigid, unnatural movements. Here, they seem relaxed overall.  

I'm not 100% certain, of course. People can act convincingly, and some liars are really good at hiding it. But the absence of classic deception cues—no frowning, no rapid blinking, no hands moving nervously—makes it feel more like they're being honest. It just seems... effortless, like they're just answering a straightforward question. Honestly, it leans toward truth for me, but I'd want to see more context to be sure. If I had to guess based on this clip alone, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to call it a slam dunk.

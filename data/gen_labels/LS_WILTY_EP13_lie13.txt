Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. At first glance, there are a few things that make me lean toward maybe deception, but honestly, it's super ambiguous. Like, their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently—almost like they're surprised or confused by the question—but I've seen people do that when they're just trying to process something, not necessarily when they're hiding something. And they're blinking a lot, which feels like nervous energy, but I've also noticed people blink more when they're tired or stressed about being filmed, not just lying. 

Then there's the gaze—always looking sideways instead of directly at whoever's asking, and their head keeps tilting and moving back a bit. That *does* make me think they might be avoiding eye contact, which people often associate with lying. But I've also seen folks glance sideways naturally, especially if they're not used to being on camera or if they're just uncomfortable in the situation. The head moving backward and side-turning could feel like they're trying to create distance, which might hint at discomfort, but it could also just be them shifting in their seat without any ulterior motive. 

On the flip side, there's no smiling, no frowning, no obvious signs of trying too hard to seem calm (like forced smiles or fake laughter), which actually makes it feel less like someone who's *trying* to deceive. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more exaggerated gestures or trying to overcompensate. The fact that they're mostly still except for those subtle head and eye movements feels... neutral? Like they're just answering honestly but maybe a bit uneasy. 

Honestly, the hardest part is that all these cues are so common in everyday stress—like when you're trying to remember something or feel judged. I can't rule out deception, but I also can't say for sure it's there. It’s the kind of thing where without knowing the context—like what the question was about or what they're supposed to be saying—it’s really hard to tell. If I had to guess right now? I’d say it’s possible, but not certain. Maybe they’re just not great at being on camera, and the nervousness is making them look like they’re hiding something. But I’d want to see more of the clip or hear the actual conversation before I’d feel confident either way.

Hmm, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels a bit ambiguous. They're smiling—that subtle "lip corners up" thing—and they're keeping eye contact with the person they're talking to while occasionally glancing upward. On one hand, the smile and steady eye contact seem like they're being engaged and maybe even sincere. I've noticed that when people are telling the truth, they often maintain natural eye contact without seeming overly forced, and that little smile doesn't look like it's straining their face—it's just a quiet, relaxed thing. Plus, they're not fidgeting or avoiding gaze, which usually makes me lean toward truthfulness because liars often do those nervous things to cover up. But then there's that upward glance... I've heard some people say looking up can be a sign of recalling a story, which might mean they're fabricating details. If they're lying, that upward gaze could be them "searching" for a made-up answer. And that smile... could it be a mask? Like, they're trying to seem friendly while they're actually hiding something? But it doesn't feel like a big, fake grin—it's just a small lift at the corners. Honestly, the lack of other tells (no blinking, no hands moving, no awkward pauses) is throwing me off. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of tension, but they seem pretty calm. Still, I know some people are really good at hiding it. So I'm kind of torn. My gut says they might be telling the truth because they're relaxed and engaged, but I can't rule out that the smile and upward look are part of a practiced lie. It's not clear-cut either way.

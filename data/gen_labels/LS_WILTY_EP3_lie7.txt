After watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful, though I wouldn’t say it’s certain. Their consistent smiling and laughing comes across a bit forced, almost as if they’re trying too hard to appear friendly and at ease. The laughter seems somewhat rehearsed rather than natural. Additionally, they frequently raise their eyebrows in that "wait, what?" expression and blink a lot, which often signals nervousness and can suggest they’re hiding something. Their mouth corners are turned downward even while laughing, which doesn’t quite fit with a genuine expression of amusement. They also tend to look down instead of maintaining eye contact, a common sign when someone is being less than truthful. The frequent nodding might just be an attempt to seem engaged, but paired with those other behaviors, it adds to the overall impression.

That said, it’s still possible these are just quirks of their natural expressions or cultural habits. The blinking could be due to dry eyes or animation rather than anxiety; the downcast gaze might be shyness or thoughtfulness rather than deceit. And some people do smile or laugh a lot even when honest, which makes it tricky to be sure. Given the mixed signals—smiling but tense, laughing but avoiding eye contact—I wouldn’t bet on their complete honesty but also wouldn’t be fully confident they’re lying. Overall, my impression leans toward deception, though not definitively, and I’d want more context to make a clearer judgment.

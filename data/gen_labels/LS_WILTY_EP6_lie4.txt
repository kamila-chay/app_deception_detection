Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person is maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that feels intentional, not accidental. They're not avoiding gaze or looking away, which sometimes happens when people are being deceptive, but I know that's not a hard rule. Like, some people who are lying actually overcompensate by staring too much to seem honest. Then there's that subtle downturn at the corners of their mouth—just a little frown, not a full scowl or angry expression. It looks like they're maybe concentrating hard or processing something, but I'm not sure if that's because they're constructing a lie or just genuinely thinking about the question.  

I keep wondering if that frown could be unrelated—maybe they're uncomfortable with the topic, or it's just their natural expression when they're focused. Like, I've seen people frown when they're trying to remember details, not necessarily when they're hiding something. And the fact that they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" stuff—no blinking a lot, no hand movements, no awkward pauses—makes it feel less like the "textbook" lie I'd expect. Sometimes truth-tellers get flustered too, but this feels... calm? Or maybe just rehearsed.  

On the flip side, if they *are* lying, that eye contact could be a deliberate tactic to seem trustworthy, and the frown might be a micro-expression of the stress they're feeling underneath. But honestly, without more context—like what they're being asked about or how they're reacting to specific parts of the conversation—it's really hard to say. I've seen people with a neutral or even slightly downturned mouth who were totally honest, and others who were lying but looked perfectly relaxed. The lack of other tells makes me lean toward "maybe not lying," but I'm not confident at all. It just feels... quiet, not like they're dodging anything. I'd hesitate to call it deception without more to go on.

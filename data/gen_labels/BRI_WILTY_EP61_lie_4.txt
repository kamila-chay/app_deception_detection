This is a bit complex. While watching the clip, the person doesn't exhibit many overt signs of deception, but there are subtle cues that give me pause. Notably, they raise their eyebrows a couple of times when a specific question is asked—this could indicate surprise or someone mentally working through a response. Though eyebrow raising can be a natural reaction when processing unexpected questions, it might also hint at something being off.  

Interestingly, the usual signs of lying—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous ticks—are absent. The person maintains steady eye contact and appears calm, which could suggest they’re telling the truth. However, this calmness might also be deliberate; sometimes when people are lying and aware they're being watched, they consciously try to appear composed, which in itself can be suspicious.  

The lack of classic deception cues combined with a seemingly controlled demeanor and the eyebrow raises make me lean slightly toward thinking this person might not be fully truthful. It’s not definitive, and they could just be thoughtfully processing the question, but these subtle inconsistencies suggest the possibility of deception. Without more context or information, it’s hard to be sure, but overall, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person may be hiding something.

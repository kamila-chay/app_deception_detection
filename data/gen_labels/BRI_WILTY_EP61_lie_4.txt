Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, the person doesn't seem to be doing much that jumps out at me as suspicious. The only thing that stands out is they're raising their eyebrows a couple of times—like, when the interviewer asks a specific question, their brows go up a bit, almost like they're surprised or processing something. But I've seen people do that all the time when they're genuinely thinking about a question, not necessarily lying. Like, if someone asks you a question you didn't expect, you might raise your eyebrows without even realizing it.  

That said, the absence of other classic "deception cues" is weird. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact (they're actually looking at the camera pretty steadily), no awkward pauses or forced smiles. Most people who are lying—especially if they're not super practiced—tend to have *some* nervous ticks, like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. But here, they seem pretty calm. I mean, maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not lying at all and the situation is just making them think hard.  

On the flip side, I guess if they *are* lying, they might be so composed that it's actually suspicious. Like, some people who know they're being watched will overcompensate and act too calm. But I don't know—without more context, it's hard to tell. The eyebrows thing could just be a natural reaction to the question. I’ve been in interviews where I’ve raised my eyebrows because I’m trying to remember something, and it’s nothing to do with lying.  

Honestly, I’m not sure. If I had to guess, I’d lean toward them telling the truth because the behavior doesn’t match what I’d expect from someone trying to deceive. But I could totally be wrong—deception is so subjective, and people are all different. Maybe the eyebrow thing is a red herring, or maybe it’s a tiny clue I’m overthinking. I’d want to see more of the clip or the full conversation before I’d feel confident about it. For now, I’d say it’s probably not deception, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.

Watching the clip, I'd say it's tricky to call, but honestly, the person seems pretty calm and engaged. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really listening—and they're nodding along like they're following the conversation. That feels pretty natural, not like someone trying to fake it. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, and there's no obvious nervous stuff like rubbing hands or looking away a lot. Usually, when people are lying, I see more of that—like fidgeting or avoiding gaze—but here they're just sitting there, nodding and looking straight at the person, which actually makes me think they're being straightforward.  

But then again, I've heard that sometimes people who lie *deliberately* maintain eye contact to seem credible, so that could be a red herring. And the fact that they're looking up occasionally—like they're thinking—might be a sign they're constructing a story instead of recalling something real. Some studies say liars look up when fabricating details, but I'm not sure how reliable that is. Honestly, though, the *absence* of other classic signs (no forced smiles, no awkward pauses, no weird lip movements) makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension—like a stiff posture or tense jaw—but they seem relaxed.  

Still, I wouldn't bet my life on it. People are weirdly inconsistent—some liars are super calm, and some truth-tellers get nervous. The nodding and eye contact feel genuine, but I guess you could argue they're just good at pretending. I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. It's hard to tell just from body language alone, especially when it doesn't scream "lie" or "truth."

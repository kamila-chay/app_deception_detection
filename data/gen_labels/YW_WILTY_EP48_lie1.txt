Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them being deceptive—though I'd hate to be wrong. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but I guess some do the opposite to seem too honest. Their eyes stay steady, which feels a bit off for someone relaxed. And there's this tiny smile—just the corners of their lips pulled up a little, not a full smile or anything, but it's there. It doesn't look like a natural, warm smile; more like they're forcing it, like they're trying too hard to seem friendly while they're lying. Then there's the chin moving downward a few times, like they're pulling it in a bit, which I've seen before in people who are nervous or trying to hide something. It's subtle, but it stands out when you notice it.  

But here's why I'm still unsure: maybe they're just naturally quiet or thoughtful. That direct gaze could mean they're being truthful and confident, not deceptive. The smile might just be their default when they're calm, not fake at all. And the fact they don't fidget or blink a lot—those are usually red flags for lying, so their calmness might actually point to honesty. I've seen people who lie smoothly without any obvious tells, so it's possible they're just good at it.  

Honestly, it's a tough call. The smile and chin thing feel a little off, but without more context—like what they're even talking about—it's hard to say. If it was a high-stakes question, I'd be more suspicious, but since it seems casual, maybe they're just being polite. I'd say it's probably deception, but I'm not confident at all. It could easily be a case of me overthinking it.

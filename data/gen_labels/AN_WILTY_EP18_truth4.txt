Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching, but based on what I'm seeing here, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The way they're holding their gaze directly with the person they're talking to feels pretty natural—not like they're avoiding eye contact, which is something people often associate with lying, but actually, truth-tellers can do that too. And that slight head tilt they're doing? It looks like they're genuinely engaged, like they're listening or trying to understand, not like they're faking it. Plus, their arms are open, not crossed, and they're not fidgeting at all—no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses where their mouth's just closed. That calmness makes me think they're comfortable with what they're saying.

But yeah, I can see why someone might second-guess it. Sometimes really good liars can act super calm and even make eye contact to seem convincing—like they've practiced it. And that head tilt *could* be a bit of a calculated move, though it doesn't feel forced. I also wonder if the context matters—like, if they were being questioned about something super sensitive, even a truth-teller might seem a little tense. But from what I'm seeing here, the lack of nervous habits (no blinking a lot, no lip biting, no shifting around) really stands out. Most people who are lying *do* show some physical signs of stress, even if they're trying to hide it. Here, it just looks like they're having a normal, relaxed conversation. So yeah, I'd say the odds are higher they're being honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's always room for doubt. It just feels... right, you know? Like they're not hiding anything.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but watching this clip, I keep circling back to that moment where their eyebrows shoot up and they're looking down at their hands instead of meeting the person's eyes. It's the kind of thing that makes me wonder if they're trying to hide something—like when people get nervous and avoid eye contact, or when they raise their eyebrows like they're processing something they don't want to admit. The way their gaze stays down while they're answering feels a bit off, like they're not fully engaging.  

But then I think, maybe it's just them being thoughtful or even a little shy? I've seen people look down when they're concentrating on a tricky question, not necessarily lying. And they didn't do any of the other classic "liar" stuff—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. In fact, the lack of those obvious tells kind of throws me off. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like rubbing their hands or blinking a lot, but they just seem... still. Like they're just waiting for the question to be over.  

The raised eyebrows are the real head-scratcher. Sometimes that's genuine surprise or confusion, not deception. Maybe they genuinely didn't expect the question to be so direct, and that's why they're looking away. I mean, it's easy to jump to "they're hiding something," but I've also seen people do that when they're just tired or distracted. Honestly, I'm leaning a little toward them telling the truth because the behavior feels more like discomfort than a deliberate cover-up, but I'm not 100% convinced. It's one of those moments where the video just doesn't give you enough to be sure—like they're being quiet and reserved, but not necessarily dishonest. I'd need to see more of the context to feel confident either way.

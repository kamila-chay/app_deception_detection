Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying, but there are a few things that make me lean toward "maybe" being deceptive. The way they're nodding while also shaking their head back and forth at the same time feels really off—like they're trying to say "yes" and "no" at once, which usually happens when someone's trying to cover up something or is confused about what they should say. Their gaze is also all over the place: mostly looking down and then flicking sideways, which often happens when people are avoiding eye contact because they're uncomfortable or trying to think of what to say. And their chin seems to be moving downward a bit, like they're kind of pulling their head in, which can feel defensive or closed-off.

But honestly, I'm not 100% convinced. It could totally be that they're just really nervous about the question—maybe it's a stressful topic for them, or they're not used to being recorded. Some people naturally look down when they're concentrating, and the sideways glances might just mean they're processing what they're saying. The head-shaking while nodding is weird, but I've seen people do that when they're trying to emphasize a point without fully agreeing, like "I *think* it's true, but..."—not necessarily lying. Also, I don't see any obvious signs like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or fake smiles, which are more common in deception cues. So it's hard to say if it's deception or just someone who's genuinely rattled. I'd be cautious, but I wouldn't call it a definite lie without more context. Maybe they're just bad at answering questions under pressure.

Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching, but here's what stands out to me. The person is maintaining a lot of eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like someone trying to seem honest—like they're not avoiding looking at you. But then there's this constant, almost rapid blinking that seems a bit off. I've noticed people blink more when they're stressed or trying to think of something, which could point toward deception, but it's not definitive—maybe they just have dry eyes or the lights are bothering them.  

What's also interesting is that they keep leaning their head back slightly while talking, like they're physically pulling away a little. That feels a bit defensive, which sometimes happens when someone's not being fully truthful. And their arms are wide open, which usually signals openness or sincerity, but I wonder if it's a bit forced—like they're trying too hard to look relaxed.  

On the flip side, they don't seem to be fidgeting much, which is common for liars (like touching their face or hands), and they're not smiling or laughing in a way that feels fake. Their expression is pretty neutral, which could mean they're just being calm and collected, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation but not hiding anything.  

Honestly, the blinking and the head movement make me lean toward "maybe lying," but I'm not confident at all. It could easily be a combination of stress from the interview setup—not the content—and not deception at all. If I had to guess, I'd say it's ambiguous, but the blinking and that slight retreat in posture feel like subtle signs they might be holding something back. Still, I'd want to see more context before I'd feel sure. It's the kind of thing where you'd second-guess yourself after watching it a few times.

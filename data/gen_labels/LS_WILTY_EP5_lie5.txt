Looking at the clip, I'm really trying to figure this out. The person seems pretty tense—like they're not comfortable with the question. They're looking sideways a lot instead of straight at the person asking, which I've noticed before can happen when someone's avoiding eye contact because they're trying to think of a story. Their eyes are blinking way more than usual too, almost like they're trying to avoid focusing on anything, and their mouth's just kind of shut with these awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words. They're also scowling a bit, lips pulled back like they're frustrated or annoyed, and their chin's sort of jutted down. Oh, and they keep shaking their head slightly while answering—like they're saying "no" to themselves or something, and tilting it like they're trying to process it all. 

But honestly, I'm not sure if that's deception or just them being genuinely upset. Maybe the question hit a nerve? Like, if they're being asked about something personal or stressful, they might react that way without lying. People get defensive or scowl when they're mad or embarrassed, not just when they're hiding something. The awkward pauses could also mean they're trying to be careful with their words because they're being truthful but don't want to say the wrong thing. And the head tilting? That's a common "thinking" gesture, not always a sign of lying—it could just be them trying to figure out how to answer. 

I mean, the blinking and avoiding eye contact do make me lean toward deception a little, but I keep second-guessing. Like, maybe they're just naturally fidgety or have dry eyes. Or maybe they're so used to being grilled in interviews that they're just wired for stress. Without knowing the context—like what the question was or what they're supposed to be talking about—it's really hard to tell. It feels like they're uncomfortable, but "uncomfortable" could mean a lot of things. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't say for sure. It's one of those cases where the cues are there, but they're not definitive. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe, but I'd want to see more of the conversation first.

Looking at the video, the person seems pretty calm while talking to whoever's on the other end. They’re keeping steady eye contact with the person they’re speaking to—no looking away, no glancing down or sideways. That’s the first thing that stands out to me. I’ve seen a lot of videos where people who are lying tend to avoid eye contact, like they’re trying not to be caught, so this feels a bit counterintuitive. But I know some people are really good at lying and actually *do* hold eye contact to seem convincing, so I can’t rule that out entirely.

I also notice they’re not doing any of the usual nervous stuff—no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where their mouth’s just closed like they’re searching for words, no exaggerated facial expressions like wide eyes or forced smiles. Their face is pretty neutral, which makes me think they’re not stressed or trying to cover something up. If they were lying, I’d expect maybe a little more tension in their face or body, but here it’s just… relaxed. Like they’re just having a normal conversation.

But then I second-guess myself because I’ve also heard that some liars are *too* calm—like they’re overprepared or rehearsed. Maybe they’re used to being on camera or talking to people in situations where they need to stay cool. Or maybe they’re just not the type of person who shows physical signs of lying in the first place. I’ve met people like that—super chill under pressure, no tells at all. So the lack of nervous behavior might not mean they’re telling the truth; it could just mean they’re good at hiding it.

Honestly, the steady eye contact is the strongest clue for me. If they were lying, I’d probably expect them to look away at least once, or maybe blink a lot, but they don’t. They’re just looking right at the person, like they’re genuinely engaged. It feels more like someone who’s comfortable and honest than someone who’s trying to pull a fast one. But I’m not gonna say "definitely truth" because, you know, liars can be tricky. I’d lean toward them being truthful just based on how relaxed and direct they seem, but I’d still want to hear more context before I’d be 100% sure. It’s not a perfect sign, but it’s the clearest thing I’m seeing.

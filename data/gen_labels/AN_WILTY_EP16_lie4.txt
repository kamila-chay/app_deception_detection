Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are a few things that make me lean toward deception, but others seem to contradict that. The person is looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, but I know some liars do that deliberately to seem trustworthy. They're also nodding a lot while speaking, which might just be natural agreement, but it could also be an attempt to seem more convincing. The biggest thing that stands out to me is how often they raise their eyebrows—like, multiple times during the clip. I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes signal uncertainty or even deception, like they're mentally checking themselves before speaking. But honestly, I've also seen people raise their eyebrows when they're just genuinely surprised or confused by a question, so that might not mean anything. Then there's the palms-up gesture—they're holding their hands open toward the other person, which usually reads as open and honest, but I've read that some people use that to appear innocent when they're lying. 

On the flip side, there's no smiling, no frowning, no awkward pauses, no nervous gestures like touching their face or rubbing their hands. Those are all things I'd expect if someone was being deceptive, so their calm, steady posture makes me second-guess the eyebrow thing. Maybe they're just really focused on the conversation and not stressed about it. It's tricky because the video doesn't give me context—like, what are they even talking about? If it's a sensitive topic, the eyebrow raises might just be nervousness, not deception. But if it's something they're clearly trying to avoid answering, then it could be a red flag. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The eyebrow raises and the nodding make me think maybe they're not being completely truthful, but the direct eye contact and open palms make me wonder if I'm overinterpreting. I'd probably need to hear more of the conversation or see their behavior in a different setting to be sure. Right now, I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's equally possible they're just a really composed person who happens to raise their eyebrows a lot. I wouldn't bet on it either way without more to go on.

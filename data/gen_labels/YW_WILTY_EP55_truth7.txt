Okay, so I watched the clip a couple times, trying to figure this out. The person is talking to someone, I think maybe answering a question, and they're looking right at the camera the whole time—that "gaze towards interlocutor" thing. That feels like they're trying to be honest, you know? Like, they're not avoiding eye contact, which sometimes people do when they're lying. And their hands are palms up, open, like they're showing they're not hiding anything. That's one of those classic "I'm being truthful" gestures, right? I've seen that in a few documentaries about body language.

But then there's the head shaking. They shake their head once, pretty clearly, while they're talking. At first, I thought, "Uh-oh, head shaking is a common sign of disagreement or maybe even lying." But wait, it wasn't like a frantic "no" shake—it was a single, maybe even a little hesitant, "no" to something they were just saying? Like, they were saying "I didn't do it," and then shook their head once as if to emphasize "no, really." So maybe it's not a lie indicator here—it could just be them reinforcing their statement. I mean, people do that when they're being earnest, not just when they're lying. It's hard to tell without knowing the exact question they were answering.

Also, they didn't seem nervous at all. No fidgeting, no touching their face, no weird blinking or lip movements. The description says "no frequent blinking" and "no frowning," which matches what I saw—they were pretty calm. But I know that's tricky because some people are naturally calm under pressure, even when they're lying. Like, I've met people who can lie without breaking a sweat. So the calmness doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth, it just doesn't give me a red flag.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect maybe more signs—like avoiding eye contact, or a forced smile, or those little nervous gestures. But they didn't have any of that. The palms up and steady eye contact actually lean toward truthfulness. The head shake is the only thing that made me pause, but it didn't feel like a lie tell—it felt like part of their natural speech rhythm. Maybe they were just saying "no" to a follow-up question in their head while answering.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It's possible they're telling the truth, and the head shake was just a natural part of their speaking. But I can't rule out that it's a subtle sign they're not being fully honest. Still, the lack of other tells and the open palms and eye contact make me lean toward "truth" more than "lie." Like, the evidence points that way, but I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words to be really confident. It just feels... genuine? But yeah, I'm not claiming to know for sure. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I'd say the balance tips toward them telling the truth based on what I saw.

Looking at the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those situations where it's super hard to tell just from body language alone. At first glance, they seem pretty engaged: they're actually looking at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But then their eyes are kind of downcast a lot (gaze down), and they keep tilting their head sideways a bit, which feels a little off. I've noticed when people are trying to think of something or feel unsure, they sometimes look down or shift their head like that, but it could also just be their natural way of speaking—like, maybe they're just a thoughtful person.  

The chin movements are weirdly specific—going up and down a few times. I've heard that chin movement can signal internal conflict, but I'm not convinced. It might just be them emphasizing points, like when you nod but with your chin instead. And their eyebrows are raised, which usually means surprise or curiosity, not deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they're not doing that—no scratching, no lip biting, no obvious nervous habits. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact at all (even if it's a bit downcast) makes me wonder if they're actually being truthful, because liars often *do* avoid direct gaze.  

But then again, some people are really good at lying without seeming nervous—they might even overcompensate by being too engaged. The head side-turn could also be a subtle sign of discomfort, like they're not fully comfortable with what they're saying. I'm stuck between "they seem calm and present" and "the downcast eyes and chin shifts feel like they're holding something back." Honestly, without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's almost impossible to say. If they were lying about something simple, like "I didn't eat the last cookie," the behavior might not match, but if it's something heavy, the calmness could just mean they've rehearsed it. I'd lean toward truth because the absence of classic "nervous" cues is pretty strong, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's just... ambiguous. Like, maybe they're just tired or distracted, not lying. I'd need to hear the words to feel confident.

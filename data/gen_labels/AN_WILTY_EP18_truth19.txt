Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always a perfect clue, but I'll walk through what stands out to me. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—that's one thing that feels like it leans toward truthfulness, since liars sometimes avoid eye contact, though I know some people do that even when they're honest, so it's not definitive. Their head is tilted a bit, which often seems like they're engaged or thinking, not necessarily hiding something, and they're shaking their head a couple of times—like when someone says "no" or is clarifying, but it doesn't feel forced or overly dramatic.  

What really stands out is how calm they seem. They're not fidgeting, not touching their face, not blinking a lot, and there's no sign of a fake smile or awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more nervous energy—like rubbing their hands or looking away a lot—but here, they're just sitting there, shrugging once like they're saying "I don't know" or "that's just how it is," which feels natural, not rehearsed. The head tilting and steady gaze seem like they're really listening and responding, not trying to sell a story.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. Head shaking, especially when denying something, could be a sign they're trying to convince themselves or the other person, and sometimes people lie while nodding or shaking their head to seem confident. Also, shrugging might just mean they're unsure, not that they're being truthful—it could be a way to deflect if they're hiding something. I've heard that some liars actually *over*-use eye contact to seem honest, so I can't rule that out entirely.  

All in all, though, the lack of nervous tells seems to outweigh the head shaking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little "tells" like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, especially in a moment where they'd be stressed. This feels more like someone who's just being straightforward, even if they're not super expressive. I'm not 100% certain—there's always room for error—but based on what I'm seeing, it seems more likely they're telling the truth than lying. It just doesn't feel like they're trying to cover anything up.

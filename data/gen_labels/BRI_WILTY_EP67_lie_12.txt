Looking at the clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or just nervous—this one's tricky. They're definitely avoiding direct eye contact, glancing sideways a lot, which makes me wonder if they're uncomfortable or trying to hide something. Their head also keeps moving backward like they're pulling away from the conversation, which sometimes happens when people feel uneasy. And they've got their palms up, which usually looks open and honest to me, not like someone trying to deceive. But then again, I've heard that when people lie, they might do things like raise their eyebrows to seem surprised or fake a reaction, so that could be a sign they're trying to cover something up. 

On the flip side, all those other cues—no smiling, no frowning, no awkward pauses, no hand gestures like rubbing their face—those seem pretty neutral. If they were really lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, like fidgeting or forced laughter, but they're actually pretty still. Maybe they're just really calm under pressure, or maybe they're genuinely not sure how to answer and that's why they're looking away. I've seen people do the "palms up" thing when they're trying to seem trustworthy, so that might actually be working against the deception idea. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The sideways gaze and head back could be nervousness from a tough question, not lying, and the palms up feels like it's pointing the other way. I'd need to hear the actual question and answer to be more confident, but based on the video alone, I'm leaning toward "not lying" because the signs don't quite line up with what I've heard about deceptive behavior—like the lack of micro-expressions or physical tells. But I could totally be wrong; sometimes people are great at hiding it. I'd say it's ambiguous either way.

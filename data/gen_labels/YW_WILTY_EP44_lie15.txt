Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure, but there's something about their body language that makes me lean toward them not being entirely truthful. They're keeping their gaze locked on the person they're talking to the whole time, which usually feels like an attempt to seem honest, but it's also a common thing people do when they're lying—they might be hyper-focused on maintaining that connection to avoid looking away. Then there's this weird mix of frowning eyebrows *and* raised eyebrows at the same time. That's not something you see often in genuine reactions—it feels like they're trying to look both confused and attentive, which might be a sign they're faking it. And the head moving forward, like they're leaning in slightly, feels a bit forced, like they're trying to seem engaged or sincere, but it doesn't quite match the rest of their expression. Plus, the shrugs at the end... they're not the casual "I don't know" shrug, it feels a little stiff, like they're deflecting.

But honestly, I could be reading too much into it. Maybe they're just genuinely confused or stressed about what they're being asked. That frown could be from trying to remember something, and the raised eyebrows might just be a natural reaction to the question—not deception. The head moving forward might just be them getting more into the conversation, not trying to be convincing. And shrugs are super common, even when people are telling the truth, especially if they're answering something they don't have a strong opinion on. I've seen people shrug while being totally honest about mundane stuff. So it's really hard to say for sure. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say deception is possible, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there's just enough ambiguity that it could easily be something else. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel confident.

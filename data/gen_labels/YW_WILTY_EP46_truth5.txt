Looking at the clip, I’m trying to figure out if they’re being honest or not, and honestly, it’s a bit tricky. They’re smiling with their lips pulled up—like a polite or maybe even a forced smile—and their eyebrows are actually furrowed while they’re doing it. That’s the first thing that stands out to me because genuine smiles usually have relaxed brows, not a frown. They’re also raising their eyebrows a bit, which feels like they’re trying to seem surprised or engaged, but it’s kind of clashing with that frown. On the flip side, they’re keeping steady eye contact with whoever they’re talking to, which usually leans toward truthfulness—people who lie sometimes avoid eye contact, but not always. I’ve heard that some liars actually overcompensate and stare harder to seem credible. 

But then there’s the mismatch: the smile and the frown together just feel off. Like, if they were genuinely happy or relieved about what they’re saying, the whole expression would probably feel more unified. The fact that their eyes are doing one thing (the frown) while their mouth is doing another (smiling) makes me wonder if they’re putting on a show. Still, I’m not sure—maybe they’re just stressed or concentrating hard while they talk, and that’s why their brows are pinched. The video doesn’t show any other classic tells like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, which might suggest they’re trying to stay calm, but that could just mean they’re naturally composed. 

I’d say it’s leaning toward truth, mostly because of that direct eye contact, but I can’t rule out the possibility that the smile is a bit too rehearsed. Like, maybe they’re telling the truth but nervous, so the expression is a little messy. It’s hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what I’m seeing, I’d guess they’re being honest—just not with a completely relaxed expression. It’s not a clear-cut "lie" or "truth," but the lack of other red flags tips it for me.

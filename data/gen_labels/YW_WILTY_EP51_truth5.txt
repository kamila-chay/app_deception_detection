Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out based on what I'm seeing, and it's a bit tricky because video can be misleading. The person is looking directly at the camera the whole time, which feels like they're trying to connect—like they're not avoiding eye contact, which often makes me think they're being open. Their head is tilted slightly, kind of like they're genuinely listening or engaged, not like they're trying to hide something. And their palms are up, open, which usually reads as non-threatening or honest in my experience. I don't see any of those classic "tells" people associate with lying—no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no forced smiles or frowns. They're just... calm. 

But then I wonder: maybe they're *too* calm? Like, maybe they've rehearsed this or are just really good at hiding it. Sometimes people who lie actually *overdo* the eye contact to seem trustworthy, or the head tilt could just be a habit. And palms up isn't a perfect sign—some people just gesture that way naturally, especially in casual chats. I also keep thinking about how the video's context might matter. If this was a high-stakes situation, the lack of nervousness might raise a red flag, but it doesn't look like that's the case here. 

Still, the absence of any stress cues (like scratching, avoiding gaze, or tense jaw) feels more consistent with truth-telling. Most people I know who are lying tend to fidget or look away more, even if they're trying to act natural. This just seems... relaxed. I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm watching, it leans toward truth. I'd say they're probably being honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—videos can be tricky, and people are complicated.

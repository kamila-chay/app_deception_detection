Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—not because they seem super confident, but because they just don't show any of the classic "nervous liar" signs I'd expect. Like, no fidgeting with their hands beyond just scratching their head once (which honestly could’ve been an itch), no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses or forced smiles. They seemed pretty relaxed, actually—just speaking normally, like they were answering a straightforward question. 

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. If they *were* lying, they might be really good at hiding it, right? Some people don’t get visibly nervous when they’re lying—they just stay calm. And the scratching *could* be a subtle stress signal, though it’s so minimal I’m not sure. I’ve seen people scratch when they’re just thinking, not lying. Plus, the absence of things like darting eyes or lip-biting really stands out—those are common in nervousness, but they’re all gone here. 

I guess the thing that tips me toward truth is how *ordinary* it felt. Like, if they were lying, I’d expect at least a hint of tension—maybe a slight pause or a flicker of something in their eyes. But there was nothing. It just felt like someone answering a simple question without overthinking it. But yeah, I’m not 100% certain. It’s possible they’re a really chill liar, or maybe they’re just not used to being recorded. I’d say it’s more likely truth than not, but I’d want to hear the actual words they said too—context matters a lot.

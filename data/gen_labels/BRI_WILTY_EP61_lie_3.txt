Watching this clip, I'm noticing the person seems pretty tense. They've got this constant frown going on—eyebrows pulled down tight—and their lips are definitely pulled downward, like they're holding back a grimace. No smiling at all, which feels off if they're just telling a regular story. They're also not making eye contact with whoever's talking to them, just staring down or away, which makes me think they might be avoiding the question. The lack of any nervous gestures—no fidgeting, no blinking a lot—stands out too. Usually, when people are stressed, they do stuff like that, but here they're just... still, with this heavy expression.

But honestly, I'm not totally sure. It's possible they're just genuinely upset about whatever they're talking about. Maybe the topic is really heavy—like they're sharing bad news or recalling something painful—and that's why they look so grim. Some people naturally have a serious face when they're focused, or maybe they're just tired. I've seen people who don't smile during interviews even when they're telling the truth, especially if they're trying to be professional or respectful. And the absence of "nervous" tells like hand-rubbing or fidgeting could actually *mean* they're not lying—some people are really good at hiding their stress. 

I keep circling back to that downturned lip and the frown though. When someone's genuinely upset, they might look that way, but when lying, people often tense up in ways that look forced—like this. Still, it's not a slam dunk. Without knowing the context—like what they're being asked about or their usual behavior—it's easy to misread. I'd be cautious about labeling it deception just from this. It *feels* off, but it could just be them being really serious. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel confident either way. For now, I'm leaning toward "maybe lying," but it's definitely not certain.

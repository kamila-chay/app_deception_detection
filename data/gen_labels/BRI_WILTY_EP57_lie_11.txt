Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "liar" or "truth-teller" at me. They're definitely looking at the person they're talking to, which is interesting—some people avoid eye contact when they're not being honest, but others do the opposite, so that alone doesn't really tell me much. They're also doing this head side-turn thing a few times, like tilting their head a bit to the side while talking. I've seen people do that when they're thinking or trying to seem friendly, not necessarily when they're hiding something. And their eyebrows are raised a couple of times—like, they look surprised or maybe a bit confused about the question? That could just be genuine reaction, not deception.  

What's making me hesitate is that there's no obvious "nervous" stuff—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird lip movements or excessive blinking. If they were lying, I might expect more of those classic signs, but they're not there. On the flip side, though, truth-tellers can also seem calm and composed, so maybe they're just naturally relaxed. The head tilt and raised brows might actually be signs of them trying to seem more engaged or sincere, which could be a way to cover up lying, but I'm not sure. It's also possible they're just a little uncomfortable with the question—maybe it's personal or they're not sure how to answer—and that's why they're shifting their gaze a bit (up and down, like they're thinking).  

I keep going back and forth because the absence of red flags makes me lean toward "truth," but then I think, "Wait, maybe they're good at hiding it." Like, some people don't show typical signs of lying. Or maybe they're not lying about the thing they're talking about, but they're just stressed about being on camera. I don't have enough context to know what they're even talking about—was it a simple yes/no question, or something complicated? Without that, it's hard to say if the behavior fits a lie or just a normal pause.  

Honestly, I'm not confident either way. It feels like it could go either way, and I'd want to see more of the clip or hear the actual question to be sure. The head movement and raised brows aren't strong enough for me to call it deception, but they also don't rule it out. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it's *possible* they're being honest, but I'd definitely want more evidence before I'd be comfortable saying for sure. It's one of those cases where the behavior is just... neutral. Like, it doesn't scream "lie," but it doesn't scream "truth" either. I'd lean toward "not lying" mostly because of the steady eye contact and lack of nervous gestures, but I'm really not 100% certain.

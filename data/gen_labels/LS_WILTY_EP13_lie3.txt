Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them not being deceptive based on what I'm seeing. The exaggerated mouth opening stands out—like they're really trying to emphasize something, maybe to sound convincing? But that could just be nervous energy or someone who naturally gestures a lot when talking, not necessarily lying. The lip corners down and chin moving downward feel more like they're genuinely frustrated or upset about whatever they're discussing, not hiding something. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—like fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact completely—but here they're actually looking at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which feels a bit inconsistent with deception. 

That said, the gaze down and head moving backward (like pulling away) make me pause. Sometimes people look down when they're lying, trying to avoid being caught, and the head moving back could read as defensive. But honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just thinking hard or feeling awkward about a topic, not necessarily lying. The head side-turning also feels like they're disengaging from the conversation, which could be because they're uncomfortable with the question, but again—could be about anything. 

The thing that keeps me from being confident is how *calm* they seem otherwise. No frantic blinking, no lip biting, no crossed arms. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical tension. But maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're not lying but just really unhappy about what they're saying. Like, maybe they're telling the truth but it's painful to admit, so they're acting withdrawn. I'd need to hear the actual words to be sure—I'm just judging body language here, and that's super tricky. Honestly, it feels like a maybe, but leaning toward "not lying" because the cues don't line up with the classic signs I've heard about. Still, I wouldn't bet money on it. It's honestly hard to say without more context.

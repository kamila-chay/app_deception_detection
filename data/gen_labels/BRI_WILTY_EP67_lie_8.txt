Honestly, while it's not crystal clear, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be deceiving. The main thing that stands out is their consistent sideways glance rather than direct eye contact, which can sometimes suggest discomfort or an attempt to hide something. Although some people do look away naturally when thinking or out of habit, the lack of other common signs of nervousness or tension complicates the picture. Still, the absence of typical tells doesn't necessarily mean they’re being truthful—some individuals can mask their dishonesty quite well. Without knowing the context or what’s being said, it’s difficult to be certain, but given the subtle cue of avoiding direct gaze, I’d cautiously lean toward the possibility that they’re not completely honest here. More information would definitely be needed to feel more confident either way.

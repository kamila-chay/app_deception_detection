Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to break it down based on what I'm seeing. The person in the video doesn't seem to be doing anything super obvious—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no big smiles or frowns. The only thing that stands out is that they keep looking sideways, not directly at whoever they're talking to. That makes me pause because I've heard that avoiding eye contact can sometimes signal discomfort or hiding something, right? Like, if someone's lying, they might glance away to avoid being caught. But then again, I've also read that some people just naturally look sideways when they're thinking or just aren't used to being on camera. Maybe they're just distracted by the setup or not really engaged in the conversation.  

On the flip side, the fact that they're not doing *anything else* that's typically associated with lying—no nervous blinking, no lip biting, no tense body language—actually makes me lean a bit toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more tells, like shifting in their seat or over-explaining. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure. It's hard to say without knowing what they're actually saying—like, if they're just answering a simple question about the weather, looking sideways might mean nothing, but if it's a sensitive topic, it could be a sign.  

I guess I'm torn because the sideways gaze is the only thing I can really point to, and it's not a sure thing. It could be a red flag, but it could also be completely innocent. I wouldn't bet my life on it either way, but if I had to guess based on just the video, I'd say it's *possible* they're not being fully truthful, just because of that gaze. But honestly? I'd need more context to feel confident. It's one of those things where the absence of obvious lies might be as telling as the presence of them.

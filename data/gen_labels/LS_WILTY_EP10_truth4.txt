Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, and honestly? It's a bit tricky. On one hand, they're maintaining steady eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—and they're nodding along, which usually feels like agreement or engagement, not something a liar would do while fabricating a story. They also have that head tilt and side-turn, which often comes off as thoughtful or trying to connect, not defensive. Plus, they don't seem fidgety at all—no hands rubbing, scratching, or covering their face, which I'd expect if they were nervous about lying.  

But then there's the frequent blinking and raised eyebrows. Those can sometimes signal stress or trying to think of a response, which might hint at deception. And those lips pulled down with a slight protrusion? That looks uncomfortable, like they're forcing a calm expression but it's not quite working. The chin moving up a bit too, like a subtle chin lift, could be tension. I keep wondering if the head shaking while nodding is a red flag—it's odd to shake your head "no" while nodding "yes," but maybe they're just emphasizing a point or correcting themselves mid-sentence.  

Still, the lack of classic lie cues stands out. No scowling, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles—they're not trying to *over*-perform truthfulness. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that "I'm being nice" energy, but this feels more like someone who's just... stressed while answering, maybe because they're tired or the question is tough. The eye contact especially feels genuine—liars usually look away or dart their eyes, not hold steady like this.  

Honestly? I'm not 100% sure. The stress signals could just be from the situation, not lying. But all the evidence I see points more toward them telling the truth than lying. The body language feels consistent with someone being earnest, even if they're a little tense. It's not perfect, but it's leaning truth.

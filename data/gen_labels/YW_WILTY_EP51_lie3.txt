I'm not entirely certain, but based on what I'm observing, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying. One thing that catches my attention is the repeated raising of their eyebrows while answering, which could indicate surprise or cognitive processing, but it can also be a sign someone is trying to appear innocent or is stressed by deceit. Typically, when people lie, they exhibit subtle cues like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, but here they maintain steady eye contact, which usually suggests honesty. However, the absence of nervous behaviors like laughing, frowning, or hesitant pauses feels a bit unusual—as if they're controlling their demeanor too carefully.

That said, raised eyebrows alone aren’t a clear indicator one way or another. It might be just their natural expression or a sign of confusion rather than deception. The fact that they’re so still and composed, aside from those eyebrows, could suggest they are calm, but it could also mean they’re consciously trying to mask their true feelings. The combination of these subtle signals makes me lean towards thinking they might not be telling the full truth, although it’s not definitive. Given the ambiguity, I’d want to see more context or follow-up questions before coming to any firm conclusion. So, while I’m inclined to suspect deception, I’m far from certain about it.

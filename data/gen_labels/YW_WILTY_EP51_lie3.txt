I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I can see why someone might think they're lying. The thing that sticks out to me is how they keep raising their eyebrows while answering, like they're genuinely surprised or processing something. When people lie, they often have more subtle tells like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, but here they're looking right at the person asking the question the whole time, which usually feels more honest to me. There's no nervous laughing, frowning, or that awkward "uh" pause where someone's stalling—they're just speaking calmly with their eyebrows up, which honestly feels more like they're thinking hard about the question than trying to hide something.  

But I get why it might seem suspicious. Raised eyebrows *can* sometimes signal deception, like when someone's trying to seem innocent or is stressed about the lie. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, though—I've seen people do that when they're genuinely confused, not lying. And honestly, the lack of other signs is weird for a liar. If they were making it up, I'd expect more fidgeting, like hands moving or avoiding eye contact, but they're totally still, just with those eyebrows. It's almost like they're *too* composed, which could be a red flag, but it also feels like they're just a calm person who raises their eyebrows a lot.  

I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not confident. If I had to guess, I'd say the eyebrows are just part of their normal reaction to the question—not a lie tell. But if I saw this in real life, I'd probably ask follow-up questions to be sure, since it's hard to tell from just this clip. Like, maybe they're just tired or distracted, not lying. Yeah, that feels right—I think they're being honest, but I wouldn't bet money on it.

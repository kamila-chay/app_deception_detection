Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they don't seem to be doing any of the obvious "lie" tells I've heard about—no nervous laughter, no fidgeting with hands, no avoiding eye contact in the way I'd expect. Wait, actually, they *are* avoiding eye contact—looking away instead of at the person they're talking to—so that's a bit of a red flag. And they keep raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're trying to seem surprised or innocent, which I've read can sometimes be a sign of deception when someone's overcompensating. Plus, they're touching their head or neck repeatedly, which feels like a nervous habit. I've seen people do that when they're stressed, and lying can make you stressed.

But then I think, maybe it's not about lying at all. Maybe they're just really anxious by nature—some people fidget or avoid eye contact even when they're being honest, especially in interviews or formal settings. The eyebrow-raising could just be their normal expression, like they're genuinely confused or processing what they're saying. And the head-touching? Could be a reflex from thinking hard, not necessarily deception. I mean, I've done that myself when I'm trying to remember something, and I wasn't lying about it.  

The thing that keeps me leaning toward "maybe lying" is that combination—avoiding eye contact *plus* the extra eyebrow movements and head-touching all at once. It feels a bit forced, like they're trying too hard to seem calm. But honestly, I can't rule out that they're just naturally awkward or tired. Without more context, like what they're saying or the situation, it's hard to tell. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need to see more of the conversation to feel confident. Right now, I'm just... not sure. It feels like a maybe, but not a definite.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out is that they're nodding while they're talking—like, they're definitely doing it naturally, not like a forced or exaggerated thing. Nodding usually feels like a sign of agreement or sincerity, especially when someone's explaining something, so that makes me lean toward them telling the truth. There's no fidgeting, no weird eye movements, no awkward pauses where they seem to be searching for words, and they're not avoiding eye contact either. If they were lying, I'd expect to see more nervous ticks—like touching their face, blinking too much, or looking away a lot—but none of that's happening here. It just seems calm and steady, which feels like it lines up with honesty.

But then, I keep thinking, maybe they're just really good at hiding it. I've seen people who nod a lot as a habit, even when they're not being truthful—they might do it to seem cooperative or to buy time while they think of a lie. And honestly, without knowing the context, it's hard to say. Like, are they answering a simple question they know the answer to, or is this a high-pressure situation where they're trying too hard to seem relaxed? If it's the latter, that nod might be a little too perfect, like they're overcompensating. I also wonder if the nod is even related to what they're saying—sometimes people nod along without really listening, so it could be coincidental. 

At the end of the day, though, the absence of all those classic "lying" cues (no scowling, no lip biting, no frantic gestures) really stands out to me. It doesn't *feel* like deception, but I'm not going to say for sure. I'd guess they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd stake my money on it. It's one of those situations where the quiet, normal behavior might actually be the most telling thing.

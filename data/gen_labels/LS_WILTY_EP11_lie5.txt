Hmm, this is tricky. From what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm on the surface—they're not smiling or laughing, which sometimes happens when people are being deceptive, but it's also just how they naturally carry themselves. I notice their lips are pulled down a bit and kind of retracted, like they're holding back or suppressing something, which feels a little off for a relaxed conversation. Their eyes are mostly on the person they're talking to, but there's this subtle sideways glance here and there, like they're avoiding direct eye contact for a moment. And their head... it keeps bobbing forward and back, like they're leaning in slightly but then pulling back, which feels a bit nervous or forced? Not like a natural nod, more like they're trying to seem engaged but it's not quite matching.

On the other hand, I'm really not sure. People can look like this for so many reasons—maybe they're just tired, or the topic is heavy, or they're genuinely focused and thinking hard. The sideways glance could just be them processing what they're saying, not hiding anything. And the lip thing? Some people just have a natural downturn to their mouth when they're concentrating. The head movements might even be accidental, like they're adjusting their posture without realizing it. I've seen people who are totally honest act this way when they're stressed about something unrelated, like a work deadline or a personal issue. 

Honestly, it's hard to pin down. The cues aren't screaming "liar," but they're not normal either—they feel a little tense, like they're holding themselves a bit too carefully. But then again, I've watched so many videos where people look like this and are just being quiet and thoughtful. Without knowing the context—what they're even talking about—it's almost impossible to tell. I'd lean toward maybe something's off, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's way more likely they're just being serious than actively deceptive. I'd say it's a maybe, but I wouldn't be confident either way. It's not like they're fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely, which would be a stronger sign. This feels... ambiguous.

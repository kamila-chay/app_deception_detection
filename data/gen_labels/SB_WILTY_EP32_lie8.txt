Hmm, this is a tough one. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, the person doesn't seem to be doing anything that screams "lying" to me. Like, they're not fidgeting, not smiling awkwardly, not avoiding eye contact entirely—they're just... looking down a lot. The gaze is consistently downward, which is the only thing that stands out. Now, I know some people think looking down means someone's hiding something, but I've read enough about body language that it's super unreliable. Like, when I'm trying to remember something or just feel a bit shy, I look down too. Maybe they're just thinking hard about what they're saying, or maybe they're just naturally a bit reserved.

But then again, the absence of *other* signs is weird. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* tension—maybe a little too much blinking, or a forced smile, or even just seeming stiff. But they seem pretty calm and natural in their posture, not crossing arms or fidgeting. The whole thing feels... quiet. Like they're just answering a question without any extra drama. That actually makes me lean toward them telling the truth because liars often *do* add extra little movements or expressions to try to seem convincing, even if it's subtle. 

Still, I can't be sure. Maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show any classic signs, or maybe they're just really nervous *about* being asked the question, which would make them look down. Or maybe the downward gaze is just because they're looking at a note they're reading. I don't see a note, but it's possible. Honestly, without more context—like what the question was or how they were reacting to it—it's hard to pin down. The video just shows them speaking calmly with that downward gaze, and that's it. 

So yeah, my gut says they're probably telling the truth because the behavior feels too... ordinary. But I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. It could easily be the opposite if they're just a very composed liar, or if the downward gaze is a nervous habit they have even when they're being honest. I'd need to see more of the interaction to feel confident. Right now, it just feels like someone who's focused on their words, not someone who's hiding something. But I'm not going to bet the farm on it.

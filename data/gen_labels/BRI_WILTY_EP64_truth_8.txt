Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video alone, honestly. The person's behavior doesn't scream "lying" to me, but it also doesn't feel completely effortless like a relaxed truth-teller. I noticed they kept raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really noticeable—almost like they were trying to look extra attentive or maybe even a bit surprised? And their eyes were wide open a lot, exaggeratedly so, like they were really trying to hold the other person's gaze or emphasize something. That part made me pause for a second because sometimes people do that when they're nervous or crafting a story.  

But then, the other stuff... they weren't smiling or laughing at all, which might be odd if they were trying to seem friendly or convincing. No frowning, no awkward pauses, no touching their face or arms—those are usually bigger red flags for deception. They also weren't avoiding eye contact; the description says they weren't looking at the person they were talking to, but I think that's just their natural way of speaking, not necessarily hiding something. Like, some people just don't lock eyes when they're focused on what they're saying.  

On the flip side, though, the raised eyebrows and wide eyes could just be how they naturally express themselves when they're talking—maybe they're really passionate or just excited about the topic. I've seen people do that when they're telling the truth and just trying to be clear. It’s hard to tell if it’s nervous energy or genuine enthusiasm. And the fact that they didn’t do *anything* else that’s commonly associated with lying (like fidgeting or covering their mouth) makes me lean toward them being honest. But I’m not 100% sure. It’s possible they’re just a very calm liar who doesn’t show the usual signs, or maybe they’re just a very expressive person. Honestly, I’d need more context—like what they’re actually saying—to feel confident. Right now, I’d say it’s *more likely* they’re telling the truth, but I’d hesitate to call it definite. It’s one of those cases where the absence of deception cues is more telling than the presence of something that *could* be suspicious.

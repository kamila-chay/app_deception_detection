Honestly, I'm really not 100% sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The way they're looking directly at the person they're talking to—gaze toward interlocutor—seems pretty solid for someone being genuine. Liars often avoid eye contact, so that feels like a good sign. Also, their arms are open, not crossed, which usually reads as relaxed and receptive, not defensive like you'd expect if they were hiding something. 

But yeah, there are some things that make me pause. They're raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking frequently, which some people might point to as nervousness or lying. I've seen that before—like when someone's trying to seem surprised or think fast. And they're crossing their fingers while talking, which I've heard is sometimes a "wishful thinking" gesture, but I'm not sure if that's actually linked to deception. Hands rubbing and touching their head could also be stress, but maybe they're just tired or the room's stuffy? 

Here's where I'm torn: the head tilting seems curious, not suspicious—like they're genuinely listening. And the lack of frowning or scowling feels important. If they were lying, I'd expect more negative expressions, but they're mostly neutral with those raised eyebrows. The awkward pauses aren't there either, which sometimes happens when people are fabricating. 

Honestly, though, it's hard to say for sure. Those blinking and eyebrow things *could* be lying signs, but they could also just be how they naturally react when they're thinking or a bit stressed about the conversation. I guess I'm more convinced by the direct eye contact and open posture—it just feels like they're engaged, not hiding. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Maybe it's just a naturally expressive person, not a liar. I'd need more context to be sure, but based on what I see, truth feels more likely.

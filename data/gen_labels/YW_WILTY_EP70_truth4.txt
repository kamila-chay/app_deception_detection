Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—looking directly at them, not darting their eyes around or avoiding gaze—and they're nodding along as if they're genuinely following the conversation. Their head stays up, and they even have this subtle chin movement upward that feels like a natural gesture of agreement or thoughtfulness, not tension. I don't see any of the classic "nervous" signs people often associate with lying: no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where they're just staring at the floor, no forced smiles or scowls. They're just... present. 

That said, I'm not totally convinced it's a slam dunk for truth. Some people who lie really well actually *do* make good eye contact and nod—they've practiced it, or they're just very confident in their story. And the chin movement? It could just be a habit, not necessarily a sign of honesty. Like, maybe they're just naturally a bit expressive with their jaw when they're thinking. I've heard that avoiding eye contact is often seen as a lie sign, but the opposite isn't always true—some liars overcompensate with too much eye contact to seem trustworthy. So it's possible they're just skilled at faking it. 

But here's why it still leans truthful to me: the absence of *any* stress cues stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one small tell—like a flicker of hesitation, a hand rubbing, or a tense jaw. Instead, they're relaxed, responsive, and their body language feels aligned with what they're saying. It's not perfect, but it's the kind of calm, consistent behavior that usually matches up with someone telling the truth. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but based on this clip, I'd guess they're being honest. It just doesn't feel like the kind of performance that's usually needed to hide a lie.

Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn on this one. The person seems pretty engaged—keeping eye contact with the person they're talking to (that "gaze towards interlocutor" is clear), and their arms are open, which usually feels like they're trying to seem approachable or honest. They're nodding along too, which can read as agreement or attentiveness. But then there's that raised eyebrow—like they're reacting to something, maybe a question they're not comfortable with? And their eyes keep drifting down, not quite meeting the other person's gaze directly. I've heard that avoiding eye contact can sometimes signal discomfort or lying, but I also know people look down when they're just thinking or feeling shy, especially if they're nervous about the conversation.  

The open arms and nodding make me think they're trying to seem genuine, which feels a bit confusing if they *are* lying—usually, people who are deceptive might close off their body language. But maybe they're overcompensating? Like, they're so focused on seeming honest that they're doing the "right" things (open arms, nodding) but the subtle signs—like the raised brows and downcast eyes—might be slipping through. On the flip side, it could just be them being naturally expressive or anxious about the topic, not necessarily lying. I mean, everyone gets a little tense when they're being questioned, right? The lack of smiling or laughing also stands out—maybe they're just serious, or maybe they're trying not to seem too relaxed while lying.  

Honestly, I'd lean toward them possibly not being fully truthful because of the downcast gaze and the raised eyebrows feeling a bit "off" for someone who's calm and telling the truth. But it's really hard to say for sure—those open arms are throwing me off. Like, if they were lying, why would they have their arms wide open? It’s not a clear-cut case. I’d need more context, like what they’re actually saying, to feel confident. For now, I’m not 100% sure, but I’d be a bit suspicious.

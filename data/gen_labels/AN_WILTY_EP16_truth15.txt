Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always a perfect tell, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing. They're sitting with their arms fully open, which usually feels like a sign of openness or honesty—like they're not hiding anything. Their eyes are wide open in a way that seems genuine, not forced, and they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That feels like they're trying to connect, not evade. I also notice they raise their eyebrows a few times, which sometimes happens when people are surprised or emphasizing something, and that doesn't scream "lying" to me—it could just be natural reaction to what they're saying.  

But here's where I hesitate: raised eyebrows and big eyes can sometimes be a sign of nervousness, especially if someone's trying too hard to seem sincere. Like, if they *were* lying, they might overdo the "look at me, I'm honest" stuff. And I know some people think exaggerated eye movements are a red flag for deception, so I can see why someone might lean that way. Still, the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact, not fidgeting, and not crossing their arms (which often signals defensiveness) makes me think that nervousness might be more about the topic being heavy, not guilt.  

The arms open is really sticking with me—it's a strong, nonverbal cue for openness, and it's consistent. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be more closed off, like arms folded or leaning away. Instead, they're leaning in, eyes on the person, and the energy feels... present. Like they're actually engaged in the conversation.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. People can be expressive without lying, and truth-tellers can get nervous too. But based on what I'm seeing—no classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, avoiding eyes, or closed-off posture—I'm leaning toward them being truthful. It just feels more like someone who's being direct and a little earnest, not someone trying to cover up something. But yeah, without knowing the context or what they're actually saying, it's still a guess. I'd say truth is more likely, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

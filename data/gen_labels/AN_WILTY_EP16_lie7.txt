I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're lying, but I'm leaning toward the possibility that they might be deceptive. They maintain direct eye contact throughout, which often suggests honesty since liars tend to avoid looking directly at someone. However, their mouth is pulled down at the corners in what looks like a frown or stress, which can sometimes indicate someone is hiding something. Although people can frown when genuinely upset, the lack of other nervous behaviors—no rapid blinking, no hand fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact—makes it a bit ambiguous. Usually, lying comes with more obvious signs of discomfort, but some liars are skilled at keeping calm and composed, especially if they've rehearsed. Given that, the calmness combined with the frown could suggest they’re masking their true feelings. While the steady eye contact leans more toward honesty, I can’t shake the feeling that the tension in their expression might point to deception. Overall, I think it’s more likely they’re not being entirely truthful, but I’m not completely certain.

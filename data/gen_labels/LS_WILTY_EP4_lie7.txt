Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. On one hand, they've got those raised eyebrows and the frowning brows together—that kind of mixed facial tension often shows someone's trying to think of a story or feels uneasy, which could point to deception. The lips are kind of pushed out too, which sometimes happens when people are concentrating hard or holding back something. But then they're looking right at the camera the whole time, and their arms are wide open, which usually feels like an honest, open gesture—like they're trying to seem approachable or genuine. I've seen people do that when they're trying to *sound* truthful, even if they're not.  

But here's where I'm not sure: the open arms might just be their natural posture, not a deliberate "I'm truthful" move. And the lip protrusion could easily be a nervous habit, not a sign of lying. Some people just do that when they're thinking. Plus, the fact they're maintaining eye contact makes me question the deception label—I've heard that liars often avoid eye contact, but I know that's not a hard rule. Maybe they're just really comfortable with the setup, or they're genuinely confused about what they're being asked.  

Honestly, the mixed signals are throwing me off. The tension in their face feels like it could be deception, but the open posture and direct gaze feel like truth. I'd lean toward them being truthful *if* the context of the conversation was neutral, but if it's something high-stakes, that tension might tip it. Still, I'm not 100% sure—sometimes people just have weird expressions when they're tired or distracted. I'd want to see more of the conversation to be safe, but based on this clip alone, I'm not confident either way. It just feels... complicated.

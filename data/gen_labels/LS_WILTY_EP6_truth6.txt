Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out based on what I'm seeing in the video. The person is smiling a lot—lip corners up, not forced-looking—and they're nodding while they talk. They keep looking at the person they're speaking to, which feels engaged, and their arms are open, like they're not hiding anything. There's no frowning, no awkward pauses, and they're not avoiding eye contact entirely—they're glancing sideways sometimes, but that could just be natural movement, not like they're trying to hide something. The smile and the open posture really stand out as signs of comfort, which usually lines up with being truthful.

But I'm not totally convinced, you know? Sometimes people smile when they're nervous or trying to seem friendly, even if they're lying. And that sideways glance... I wonder if that's just their normal way of talking, or if it's a tiny sign they're not fully present. Like, in some cultures, direct eye contact can feel aggressive, so maybe they're just being polite by not staring. Also, the absence of "tells" like fidgeting or blinking a lot doesn't *prove* they're honest—it just means they're not showing obvious stress. People can be really good at controlling their body language when they're lying, especially if they're practiced. 

So yeah, I'd lean toward them being truthful based on what I see—smiles, nods, open arms, and steady (if not perfectly direct) eye contact all feel like they're being genuine. But I can't rule out the possibility they're just really good at faking it, or that the sideways gaze is a clue I'm overthinking. It's not 100% clear-cut, but the cues they're giving seem to point more toward truth than deception. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to hear more context to be sure.

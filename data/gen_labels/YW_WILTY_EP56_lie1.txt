Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their eyebrows do this unusual thing—both raised and furrowed simultaneously—which is not a natural expression and seems somewhat forced, as if they’re trying to appear surprised yet worried at the same time. They also tilt their head slightly to the side, a gesture I’ve seen before when someone is grappling with how much to reveal or possibly trying to hide something. Although they maintain steady eye contact, which typically suggests honesty, this, combined with the other cues, feels a bit contradictory.

They do use a palms-up gesture, which often signals openness and sincerity, and there’s no obvious fidgeting or avoidance of eye contact that would straightforwardly indicate deception. Still, that eyebrow movement sticks out as inconsistent with their otherwise calm demeanor, almost like a subtle giveaway. The head tilt could be innocent, maybe just them thinking or trying to appear more approachable, but it’s also a known tell when someone is fabricating a story.

All in all, while I wouldn’t say with certainty they’re lying, the mix of signals—especially that awkward eyebrow expression paired with the head tilt—makes me suspect they might be leaning toward deception. It’s a hunch rather than a firm conclusion, but something about their demeanor just seems slightly off, suggesting they could be less than truthful.

Looking at this clip, I'm honestly a bit torn. On one hand, the person's face is doing this odd thing with their eyebrows—like they're both raised *and* furrowed at the same time. It’s not a natural expression; it feels forced, like they're trying to look surprised but also worried. And they keep tilting their head slightly to the side, which I've noticed before can happen when someone's processing something they don't want to say. That, combined with the way they're keeping steady eye contact (gazing right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels honest), makes me lean toward them not being fully on the same page. 

But then there's the palms-up gesture—they're holding their hands open like they're being transparent, which is often a sign of sincerity. And they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, not blinking a lot... all of which usually point to truthfulness. I wonder if the eyebrow thing is just a nervous habit or maybe they're genuinely confused about the question, not lying. Maybe they're trying to seem calm but their face is betraying them. 

The head tilt is the real puzzle. It could be just them thinking, or it could be that classic "deception tell" where people tilt their head to seem more approachable while they're crafting a story. But honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just trying to listen carefully too. I don't think I'd be comfortable saying they're lying for sure—there's enough "normal" stuff going on (the eye contact, the open palms) that makes me doubt it. But that eyebrow thing... it's so out of sync with the rest of their calm demeanor. It’s the kind of detail that sticks with you. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're being evasive, but I’m not 100% sure. It’s one of those moments where you think, "Hmm, something’s off, but I can’t quite put my finger on it."

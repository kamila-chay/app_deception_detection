Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean slightly toward them not being deceptive—though it's really close. The main thing that stands out is how they keep looking down, like they're avoiding eye contact entirely. I know that's often flagged as a "lie sign" in some studies, so at first glance, that makes me think they might be hiding something. But then I keep noticing how calm they seem otherwise—no fidgeting, no weird pauses, no obvious nervous habits like touching their face or rubbing their hands. If they were really lying, I'd expect more of those little tells, right? Like, you'd think they'd be more tense or trying to overcompensate with smiles or nods. But here, they're just... still. 

That makes me wonder if they're just shy or uncomfortable in the situation, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just processing what they're saying, or they're from a culture where looking down is normal when speaking respectfully. I've heard that in some places, avoiding eye contact isn't about deception at all—it's just polite. And since they're not doing anything else that screams "I'm lying" (like fake laughter or exaggerated expressions), it feels more like they're just being quiet or thoughtful. 

But then again, I could be missing something. Some people are really good at hiding their nerves, so maybe they're lying but just exceptionally calm. Or maybe they're not lying about the thing they're saying, but they're uncomfortable with the *question* itself—like they're just tired of being asked. I mean, the video doesn't show the context, so I don't know what they're talking about. If it's something super personal, even a truthful person might look down. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The gaze down is the only real clue, and it's not a slam-dunk. I'd probably say "not lying" if I had to guess, but I'd still be a little unsure. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to see more of the conversation or hear their tone to be sure. Like, if they'd said something shaky or inconsistent, that'd change things. But based on just the behavior here? I'd lean toward truth, but with a big "maybe."

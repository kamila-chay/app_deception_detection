Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit of a toss-up. The way they're smiling while also frowning at the same time feels off, like they're trying to keep a neutral or polite expression but it's not quite landing. Their head's moving forward toward the camera a lot, which might seem engaged, but they're also glancing down frequently instead of holding eye contact, and their chin's lifting up a bit when they talk—almost like they're forcing themselves to look attentive. Then there's the hand stuff: they keep scratching their head and touching their face or neck, which usually makes me think someone's feeling uneasy or stressed about what they're saying. Those little fidgets with their hands feel like they're trying to calm themselves down, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something.

But honestly, I'm second-guessing it too because maybe they're just really nervous about the whole situation—like, maybe they're not lying at all but just super anxious about being recorded. The smile could be a polite habit, and the frown might just be them concentrating hard on their words. Some people naturally glance down when they're thinking, especially if they're not used to being on camera, and the head movements could just be part of their natural way of speaking. I've seen people scratch their heads when they're tired or distracted, not necessarily when they're being deceptive. It's tricky because these cues aren't foolproof—what looks like stress could just be their baseline.

All things considered, the combination of the conflicting facial expressions (smiling *and* frowning) plus the hand gestures feels more like something that could point to deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's hard to say if they're just being awkward or actually hiding something. I'd lean toward them not being entirely truthful, but I'm not 100% convinced. It's one of those cases where you'd want to see more of the conversation or hear what they're saying to feel more confident. For now, I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's definitely not clear-cut.

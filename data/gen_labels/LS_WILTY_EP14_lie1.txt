Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but watching the clip, I'd lean a little toward them not being entirely truthful—though it's really hard to say for sure. What stood out to me was how they kept raising their eyebrows *really* high, like they were surprised or trying to seem extra attentive, and their eyes got super wide open at times—almost like they were forcing themselves to look "sincere." Then there was this weird thing where they kept turning their head slightly to the side while talking, and their gaze kept dropping down instead of meeting the other person's eyes. I've seen that before with people who feel like they're being tested or are trying to think of what to say next, which can feel like a cover-up. Plus, their mouth corners lifted up just a tiny bit, but it didn't look like a real smile—it felt kind of stiff, like they were trying to seem friendly when they weren't. 

But here's why I'm hesitating: maybe they're just naturally expressive? Some people have big eye movements and raised eyebrows as part of how they talk, especially if they're nervous about being on camera. The head turning could just be a habit, not a sign of lying, and the gaze down might just mean they're shy or concentrating, not hiding something. I've known people who always look away when they're being honest but just don't know how to hold eye contact. And that little lip lift? Could be a genuine attempt to be polite, not a lie. 

Honestly, it's tricky. The behaviors *could* point to deception, but they could also just be their normal way of interacting. If I had to guess based on what I saw, I'd say it's *more likely* they're not telling the full truth—like they're holding back or being evasive—but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's the kind of thing where without knowing the context, it's almost impossible to be sure. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear the actual words before I'd feel confident either way.

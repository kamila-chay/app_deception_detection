Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip right now, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The person seems a bit tense while answering, and I noticed they're raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really frequently, almost like they're surprised by their own words. Their eyes are blinking way more than usual too, which sometimes makes me think someone's nervous or trying to avoid looking at something. And their chin keeps lifting up slightly, like they're subconsciously trying to push their jaw forward, which I've heard can be a sign of uncertainty.

But wait, I should consider other things too. They're actually looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels odd if they're lying—most people avoid eye contact when they're being deceptive, right? And their head is tilting and turning sideways a bit, but that could just be them thinking or being engaged, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're trying to remember something or just being expressive. 

The thing that's really making me hesitate is that it doesn't *feel* like classic deception to me. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or maybe avoiding eye contact, but they're not doing that. Maybe they're just really stressed about the question—like, they're genuinely trying to answer honestly but are struggling to find the words, which could explain the blinking and the raised eyebrows. Or maybe it's just how they naturally act when they're thinking hard. I mean, I've definitely had moments where I've blinked a lot because I was tired or the room was bright, not because I was hiding something. 

On the flip side, the chin movement and the way they're holding their head... it's subtle, but it does feel a bit off. Like they're bracing themselves for something. But I'm not sure if that's because they're lying or just because they're anxious about the whole situation. Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth but being really nervous, but I can't rule out deception entirely. It's just hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're talking about. I'd say it's probably not deception, but I'm not confident—there are too many ways this could be explained without lying.

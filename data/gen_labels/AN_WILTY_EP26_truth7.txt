Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. They seem pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous blinking. In fact, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually leans toward honesty, and their palms are open and facing up, which feels like an open, non-defensive gesture. They're nodding along naturally, and their head turns sideways a few times, but that seems more like a relaxed, conversational thing rather than someone avoiding the question. The way their chin moves up and down while speaking also looks like just natural emphasis, not something I'd associate with lying.  

That said, I can see why it's not 100% clear. Some people are really good at hiding their emotions when they're lying, so the lack of nervous ticks doesn't *prove* they're truthful—it could just mean they're practiced at it. And the sideways glances might make someone pause, since people sometimes look away when they're not being honest, but here it feels more like they're just thinking or gesturing naturally, not dodging. Also, the chin movements aren't something I've heard much about in lie-detection, so I'm not sure if that's relevant or just part of their speaking style.  

Honestly, the absence of all those classic "liar tells"—like frowning, lip biting, or hand-wringing—makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I'm not going to claim I know for sure. It's possible they're just a very calm person, or maybe they're lying so smoothly that it's hard to spot. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the context of the conversation too before feeling confident. It's just one of those cases where the behavior doesn't scream "lie," but it also doesn't scream "truth" loud enough to rule out the other option.

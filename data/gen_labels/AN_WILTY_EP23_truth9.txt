Looking at the clip, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while talking. They're making direct eye contact the whole time—no looking away or darting eyes, which usually makes me think they're not avoiding the question. And their arms are open, not crossed or folded, which feels like a natural, relaxed posture rather than something tense or defensive. I don't see any of those classic "nervous" tells either—no fidgeting with hands, no weird lip movements, no excessive blinking. It just looks like they're just speaking plainly, like they're comfortable with what they're saying.

That said, I can't say for sure they're telling the truth. Some people who lie are really good at keeping it together—they might practice eye contact or just have a naturally open stance even when they're not being honest. Maybe they're just confident or used to being on camera, not necessarily truthful. And honestly, without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to tell if the content itself feels off. Like, if they were denying something obvious, I'd be more suspicious, but here it just seems like a straightforward conversation. 

So yeah, based on the body language alone, it leans toward them being genuine—no red flags jumping out at me—but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. People are weirdly inconsistent sometimes. If I had to guess? I'd say truth, but with a shrug. It just doesn't *feel* like someone trying to hide something. You know?

Looking at the clip, I'm honestly a bit torn on this one. On one hand, they're smiling and nodding while making eye contact, which usually feels like someone being engaged or even friendly—like they're trying to seem cooperative. The way they're raising their eyebrows and tilting their head sideways also seems pretty natural, like they're processing what's being said rather than hiding something. And the fact that they're looking down occasionally instead of avoiding eye contact completely makes me wonder if they're just a bit shy or thoughtful, not necessarily deceptive.  

But then there are these weird little contradictions that stick out. They're smiling *and* scowling at the same time, which feels off—like they're trying to mask something with forced expressions. And the awkward pauses with their mouth shut? That’s the part that gives me pause. When people lie, they often fumble with their words or have those unnatural silences where they’re searching for an answer, not just thinking. The gaze down might also be a sign they’re not fully present, like they’re avoiding the question.  

Still, I’m not totally convinced. Maybe they’re just stressed about the situation—maybe they’re genuinely upset about something and the scowl is real, not fake. Or the smile could just be polite, like they’re trying to be nice even if they’re uncomfortable. I’ve seen people with nervous habits like that who are completely honest. It’s hard to tell if the head tilting or side-turning is nervousness or just how they naturally gesture when listening.  

Honestly? I’d lean toward them maybe not being entirely truthful, but I’m not sure. It’s one of those cases where the cues are all over the place—some feel like deception signs, others feel like normal human behavior. If I had to guess, I’d say the awkward pauses and the mix of smiles/scowls are the strongest hints, but I’d want to see more context before calling it a lie. It’s probably not a clear-cut case either way, which is why it’s so tricky to say.

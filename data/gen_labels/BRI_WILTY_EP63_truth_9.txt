Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth based on what I'm seeing. The main thing that stuck out was how they kept their gaze down the whole time—like they were looking at the floor or their hands instead of meeting the camera. At first, that made me think, "Hmm, maybe they're avoiding eye contact because they're lying," since people often do that when they're not being honest. But then I started noticing how *calm* they seemed otherwise. There wasn't any fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no awkward pauses where their mouth just stayed closed like they were struggling to think of words. Actually, the lack of all those other "tells" is kind of surprising. If they *were* lying, I'd expect them to show *some* sign of stress—like shifting in their seat, touching their face, or maybe even a forced smile. But they just sat there, quiet, with their eyes down, and that felt... steady. Like they were just thinking or maybe a bit shy, not hiding anything.  

That said, I could totally see someone arguing the opposite. Maybe they're a really good liar who's super composed, so the lack of movement isn't a clue—it's just them being practiced. Or maybe they were genuinely upset or distracted, and that's why their gaze was down, not because they were lying. I've seen people look away when they're just trying to remember something, or when they're uncomfortable in general, not necessarily when they're being deceptive. And honestly, it's hard to trust any single clue like gaze direction alone—research shows it's super unreliable. So yeah, I'm not 100% certain, but the fact that *nothing else* seemed off... it feels more like they're being truthful than not. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs to show up, even if subtle. This just feels like a calm, maybe a little reserved, but honest moment. But I'd need to see more context to be sure—I'm just going off what I'm watching here.

Watching the clip, the person appears really calm and steady—no fidgeting, no avoidance of eye contact, and they speak comfortably. There are no obvious nervous ticks like excessive blinking or shifting in their seat. While this might suggest they’re telling the truth, since honest people often show these signs when relaxed, it’s also possible they are deliberately suppressing these cues. Some individuals who are lying can train themselves to appear composed, especially if they’ve rehearsed their story. Additionally, their natural calmness could make it harder to detect any deception. Because of this, the absence of visible tension doesn’t necessarily indicate honesty; it might mean they are skilled at hiding their nerves. Given all that, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might be deceiving, though I wouldn’t say it with full certainty. More context would be needed to be sure, but based on the video alone, I’m inclined to suspect some level of dishonesty.

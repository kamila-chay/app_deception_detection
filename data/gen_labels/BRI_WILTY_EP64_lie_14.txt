Watching the clip, the person seems really calm and steady—like they're not fidgeting at all, not avoiding eye contact, and just speaking like they're comfortable. No obvious nervous ticks like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat. That actually makes me lean toward thinking they might be telling the truth because honest people often don’t show those stress signs when they’re relaxed. But here’s where it gets tricky: I’ve heard that some people who are lying can *suppress* those signs, especially if they’re practiced or really trying to seem convincing. Like, maybe they’ve rehearsed this part so much that they’re not even nervous. It’s also possible they’re just naturally calm, no matter what they’re saying—some folks are just that composed. Honestly, the lack of any visible tension makes it hard to spot deception here, but it’s not impossible. I’d say it’s *more likely* they’re being truthful based on how they’re acting, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. There’s just too much room for someone to be hiding their nerves well. It’s one of those cases where the absence of "tells" doesn’t always mean truth—it could just mean they’re good at hiding. I’d need more context to feel confident, but based on the video alone? I’m leaning toward truth, but with a lot of doubt.

It's difficult to be certain from just observing, but I find myself leaning towards the possibility that the person might be less than truthful. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which is often seen as a sign of honesty, though I know that can sometimes be deliberately used to appear sincere. Their raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or openness, but raised eyebrows have also been linked to subtle stress signals that may occur when someone is not fully honest. 

What catches my attention most is the slight chin movement—a small dip each time they respond—which can indicate hesitation or an attempt to withdraw, behaviors sometimes associated with discomfort or withholding information. Still, I recognize that this movement might also be a natural reaction to trying hard to recall details, so it isn’t definitive.

The consistent eye contact somewhat complicates the picture. While avoiding eye contact is commonly thought to signal deception, some individuals might overcompensate by staring intently to convince others of their sincerity, even if they are concealing something. 

All things considered, the eyebrow action and chin dips incline me more toward suspicion than trust, though the direct eye contact and subtlety of the behaviors suggest it’s not a clear-cut case. I’d say the signs lean slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive, but without more information, it’s hard to be sure.

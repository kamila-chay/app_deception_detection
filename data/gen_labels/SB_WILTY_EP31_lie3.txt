Honestly, this is tricky—I'm watching the clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful, but I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying. While they don’t show some of the more obvious signs like avoiding eye contact completely or fidgeting excessively, the frequent sideways glances and head tilting stand out. Those behaviors could simply mean they’re thinking or distracted, but they could also suggest they’re trying to carefully construct their story or avoid direct confrontation.

It’s odd that they’re not showing any strong emotional reactions like smiling or frowning, which might be expected if they were stressed about lying. Instead, their mixed signals—like shaking their head in a way that could be habitual or indicate disagreement—adds ambiguity. The absence of classic nervous signs such as blinking more or touching their face might initially suggest truthfulness, but it might also mean they’re skilled at hiding their deception.

Considering that some liars look away to avoid detection, their sideways glances could hint at withholding the truth, even if it could also be a sign of shyness or discomfort. The head movements might feel like politeness or processing information, but one can’t ignore that they might be masking something. While the calmness and lack of tension could point toward honesty, it’s also possible they’re simply managing their demeanor well.

I’m not fully confident making a definitive call—more context would be helpful—but on balance, the cues make me lean toward thinking they’re probably not telling the whole truth. The sideways gaze and subtle evasiveness suggest to me that deception might be involved, even if it’s not overt.

Honestly, this is tricky—I'm watching the clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful, but I'm not totally sure. At first glance, the person doesn't seem to be doing anything super obvious that screams "liar," like avoiding eye contact completely or fidgeting a lot. They're not smiling, laughing, or frowning, which actually feels a bit odd because I'd expect some reaction if they were stressed about lying. Instead, they keep glancing sideways a lot and tilting their head, which makes me wonder if they're just distracted or maybe trying to think of something. Head shaking too, but that could just be a habit or disagreement with what they're saying, not necessarily deception.  

I keep thinking, "Wait, if they were lying, wouldn't they seem more nervous?" Like, maybe they'd blink a lot or touch their face, but the video doesn't show any of that. The lack of those classic signs actually leans toward them telling the truth in my head—people who are lying often *do* show those little signs, right? But then I second-guess myself because maybe they're really good at hiding it, or maybe sideways glancing is a sign they're fabricating something. I've heard some people say liars look away to avoid detection, but I also know that's not always true—some people just naturally look sideways when they're thinking, especially if they're not used to being on camera.  

The head tilting and side-turning feel more like they're processing what they're saying or being polite, not like they're hiding something. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension—like their voice cracking or hands moving a lot—but there's nothing like that. Still, it's hard to rule out deception entirely because deception can look so normal sometimes. Maybe they're just uncomfortable, and that's why they're not meeting eyes directly. Honestly, I'm leaning toward "truthful" because the behavior seems calm and unforced, but I'm not 100% sure. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context to be confident—like, what were they even talking about?—but based on what I see, I'd guess they're not lying. Though, if I had to bet, I'd say the sideways gaze is probably just them being a little shy, not deceptive.

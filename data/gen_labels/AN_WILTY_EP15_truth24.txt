Looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person is making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually leans toward truthfulness—liars often avoid that, but not always. They're also raising their eyebrows a few times, which could just be genuine surprise or curiosity about the question, not necessarily deception. I don't see any fake smiles, awkward pauses, or signs of them trying too hard to seem convincing, which feels like a good sign. But then there's the hand rubbing—they're rubbing their hands together a couple of times, which often happens when someone's nervous or stressed. If they were lying, that might fit, but honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just uncomfortable or fidgety for no reason at all, like if they're cold or just have a habit.  

The thing that makes me hesitate is the direct gaze. If they were lying, they might be *trying* too hard to look steady, but here it seems natural—like they're just focused on the conversation. The lack of other "tells" (no fake laughter, no lip movements, no avoiding eye contact) also makes me think they might be telling the truth. But then again, someone who's practiced at lying might suppress all those obvious cues, so the hand rubbing could be their only slip. I guess I'm leaning toward truth because the overall vibe feels calm and engaged, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those cases where the little nervous habits might just be... human, not lying. Like, if I was asked a random question out of the blue, I might rub my hands too while I think. So yeah, probably truth, but I can see how someone else might hear the hand rubbing and think "uh-oh." It's not clear-cut.

From what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed overall—they're smiling a bit, which usually feels genuine when someone's relaxed, and they're tilting their head slightly while speaking, which often shows they're engaged or thinking carefully. Their eyes stay mostly on the person they're talking to, which is a good sign for honesty, and they're not fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact in a way that screams discomfort. The way they pause with their mouth closed feels natural, like they're gathering their thoughts rather than scrambling for a lie.  

But honestly, it's not totally clear-cut. That raised eyebrow thing—when they do it—could actually be a bit of a red flag, because people sometimes raise their brows when they're nervous or trying to seem innocent. And the lips being pulled back (retracted) a little while they talk? That’s a subtle tension thing, and I’ve heard that can happen when someone’s trying to hold back a reaction. Plus, their gaze dropping down sometimes—while it *could* just mean they’re concentrating—sometimes people look away when they’re making something up.  

I’m leaning toward them being truthful, mostly because the smile and head tilt feel warm and open, not forced, and there’s no obvious sign of stress like sweating or rapid blinking. But I’m not 100% sure—people get nervous for all kinds of reasons, and those little cues could just be their natural way of speaking. If I had to guess without seeing the context, I’d say it’s more likely they’re telling the truth, but I’d want to hear more of what they’re saying before I’d bet on it. It’s just hard to tell from body language alone, you know?

Looking at the video, I'm noticing this person seems pretty calm on the surface—they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact entirely (wait, actually, they seem to be glancing down a lot, not meeting the camera directly), and they're not smiling or frowning. But what stands out to me is how often they're blinking. Like, way more than usual—almost like they're trying to avoid looking at something or just really stressed. I've heard that people sometimes blink a lot when they're lying because it's a nervous habit, but I also know blinking can happen for totally normal reasons, like if the room is bright or they're tired.  

On the other hand, they're not doing any of the other classic "tells" people expect—no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles. If they were really lying, I'd expect more signs, right? Maybe they're just naturally a fast-blinker, or maybe they're just uncomfortable in the situation, not necessarily hiding something. I mean, I've seen people blink like that when they're concentrating hard on a conversation, not when they're being deceptive.  

But here's where I'm torn: the lack of other nervous behaviors feels a bit odd for a liar who's trying to cover up. Usually, if someone's lying, they'll have *multiple* signs—not just one thing. So if they're avoiding eye contact *and* blinking a lot, it could be a combo that adds up, even if it's not textbook. It's not like they're sweating or shifting around, so it's not super obvious. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It might just be their natural behavior, but the blinking combined with the gaze avoidance makes me lean toward "maybe they're not being fully honest," even if I can't say for certain. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation before I'd feel confident either way.

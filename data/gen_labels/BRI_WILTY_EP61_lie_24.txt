Watching the video, this person comes across as relatively calm outwardly—they’re not fidgeting much or showing overt signs of stress, but I do notice they frequently glance down rather than making direct eye contact with the camera. That hesitation with their gaze could suggest discomfort or an attempt to avoid scrutiny. What stands out even more is their excessive blinking, noticeably more than what seems normal. While blinking can have innocent explanations like tiredness or brightness in the room, it’s also a known nervous habit sometimes linked to deception.

At the same time, many typical signs people associate with lying—like rubbing hands, awkward pauses, or forced smiles—aren’t present here, which makes it a bit harder to be certain. People can blink a lot when concentrating deeply or feeling uneasy without necessarily lying. So the absence of multiple classic nervous cues means it’s not an open-and-shut case.

However, combining the frequent downward glances with the high blink rate does raise some suspicion. Usually, liars show several signs of stress or nervousness, so having at least these two together is somewhat noteworthy. It doesn’t scream dishonesty outright, but given the combination of gaze avoidance and excessive blinking, I’m inclined to lean toward the possibility that they might not be fully truthful, even though it’s not definitive. I would need more context or the actual conversation to make a stronger judgment.

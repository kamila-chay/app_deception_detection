Looking at the clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are some cues that make me lean one way, but others that feel like they could be totally normal. They're smiling pretty consistently, which is interesting because people sometimes smile when they're trying to seem sincere, but it could also just be them being friendly or a bit nervous. Their eyebrows are raised a lot too, which I've heard can signal surprise or maybe even skepticism, but it doesn't necessarily mean deception. I also notice they're looking at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which usually feels like honesty, but then their eyes are often downcast too—like they're avoiding direct eye contact sometimes. That’s a bit confusing because avoiding eye contact is a classic deception sign, but they're not *completely* avoiding it, and they're tilting their head a lot, which often just means they're listening or thinking.  

The thing that makes me hesitate is how *calm* they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no touching their face, no weird pauses—just smooth talking with that smile. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like blinking a lot or shifting in their seat, but they don't seem to be doing that. Maybe they're just really good at keeping it together, or maybe they're not stressed about what they're saying at all. It's also possible the smile and raised brows are just part of their natural expression when they're engaged, not a sign they're hiding something.  

On the flip side, the head tilting and downcast gaze could still feel off—like they're trying to seem humble or thoughtful to cover up a lie, but honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just genuinely processing what they're saying. I keep going back to the lack of obvious signs: no lip biting, no crossed arms, no shifting around. If this were a lie, I'd expect more physical tells. Maybe they're telling the truth, and the "deception" label is a red herring? Or maybe it's a subtle lie where they're not acting obviously nervous.  

Honestly, I'm stuck between two ideas. It feels *more* like truth-telling because of the absence of classic nervousness, but the smile and gaze patterns are making me second-guess. I wouldn't bet money on it either way—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to get more context. Without that, I'd say it's probably not deception, but I'm not 100% sure. People are complicated, and these cues don't always add up cleanly.

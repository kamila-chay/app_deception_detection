Hmm, this is tricky. Watching the clip, the person seems pretty still overall, but there are a few things that stand out. They're doing a lot of frequent blinking—like, way more than normal when someone's just talking calmly. And their eyes keep going down and sideways instead of meeting the camera directly, which feels a bit off. They also keep tilting their head to the side, which usually means they're trying to listen or think, but paired with the gaze shifts, it almost feels like they're avoiding something. The most noticeable thing is when they cover their mouth with their hand for a few seconds while answering—like they're trying to hold back a reaction or hide something. That feels like a classic sign people use when they're nervous about what they're saying.

But honestly, I'm not sure. Frequent blinking can just mean someone's tired or stressed about the whole situation—not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just uncomfortable being filmed, or the question was awkward. The head tilting isn't always deceptive either; it can be a natural gesture when someone's processing information. And they never actually look away from the camera *completely*, just not directly—so maybe they're just shy or distracted. I also don't see any signs of forced smiles, fake laughter, or other obvious "lying" tells like fidgeting with their hands. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that, but it's possible they're just really good at hiding it. 

All in all, the combination of the mouth covering, the gaze avoidance, and the blinking makes me lean toward them not being completely truthful, but it's not 100% clear. It could easily be them just being anxious or having a bad day. I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but I wouldn't bet on it without more context. There's just enough that feels off to make me wonder, but not enough to be certain.

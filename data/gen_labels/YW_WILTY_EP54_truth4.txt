Hmm, looking at this clip... honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. The person seems pretty calm overall, which is interesting because I usually expect more nervous tells when someone's lying. They're not avoiding eye contact at all—they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels like a good sign for truthfulness. And their eyebrows are raised a bit, which might just be surprise or emphasis, not necessarily deception. I've seen people raise their brows when they're being honest and trying to make a point.

But then there's that weird thing with their lips—both corners moving up and down slightly? Like, not a full smile, but kind of a tense little twitch. That's the part that makes me pause. Sometimes that happens when someone's trying to hold back emotion or is a bit unsettled, which could be lying, but it could also just be them being expressive or maybe even a little frustrated with the question. And they're looking up occasionally—some people say that's a sign of fabrication, but I've heard it's more about thinking, so it might not mean anything.

What's really making me lean toward truth is how *still* they are otherwise. No fidgeting, no hands covering their face, no awkward pauses where they're clearly searching for words. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little nervous habits, like playing with their hair or shifting in their seat. The fact that they're mostly just sitting there calmly, making eye contact, and not doing anything "off" makes me think they're probably being straightforward. But honestly? It's not a slam dunk. Some really good liars don't show those classic signs at all, and maybe they're just naturally this composed. I'd need to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure, but based on the body language alone... I'm leaning toward truth, but I'd definitely be second-guessing it if I didn't have the context. It's one of those cases where the absence of lies feels like a clue, but it's not impossible to fake calm. Gotta say, though, the lack of obvious stress cues makes it feel more likely they're not hiding anything.

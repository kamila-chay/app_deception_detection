Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because you can't always tell just from video alone. What stands out to me is that they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to the whole time—like, they're not avoiding eye contact at all. That usually makes me lean toward them being honest, because people who are lying often look away or fidget instead of holding steady eye contact. But wait, they also have their gaze directed downward a bit while doing that? Like, they're looking at the person's face but their eyes are kind of cast down a little, not straight on. That part is confusing me because sometimes people look down when they're nervous, which *could* be a sign of lying, but it also happens when someone's really thinking carefully or being respectful. 

I also notice they're not doing any of the usual "telling a lie" tells—no fake smiles, no weird blinking, no touching their face or fidgeting with their hands. They just sit there, head up, calm. If they were lying, I'd expect at least some of those nervous habits to show up, right? Like, people who lie often get restless or overdo their expressions. But here, it's all very neutral. It feels like they're just speaking plainly, not trying to hide anything. 

On the other hand, maybe the downward gaze *is* a sign they're not being truthful—like, they're avoiding the full eye contact even though they're looking at the person. But then again, maybe they're just shy or thoughtful, not deceptive. I've seen people who are totally honest but still look down when they're concentrating, especially if they're trying to remember something. So it could go either way. 

Honestly, after watching it a couple times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The lack of nervous energy and the consistent eye contact (even with that slight downward angle) feels more like someone who's just being straightforward than someone who's hiding something. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it—I mean, some people are really good at hiding lies without moving a muscle. Still, based on what I see, truth feels more likely than not.

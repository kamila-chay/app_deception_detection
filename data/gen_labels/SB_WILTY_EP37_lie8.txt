Looking at the clip, I'm noticing a few things that make me lean toward them not being entirely truthful, but I'm really not 100% sure. When they're answering, their chin seems to dip downward a bit—like they're pulling it in slightly, almost like a subtle chin tuck. It's not super obvious, but it stands out a little when they're talking, especially during the part where they're explaining the situation. And their eyes... they keep glancing sideways a few times, even though they're mostly looking at whoever's asking the question. Like, they'll lock eyes for a second, then drift their gaze off to the side, almost like they're checking something else in the room or just not wanting to hold the stare.

That sideways glance is the part that sticks with me the most—it feels a bit off. I've seen people do that when they're trying to think of what to say next or when they're avoiding direct eye contact, which sometimes happens when someone's not being straight with you. The chin movement too, while subtle, can sometimes be a sign of discomfort or internal conflict, like they're trying to hold back something. But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just nervous in general? I mean, people get nervous in interviews or when being questioned, and that can make them look away or shift their posture without it meaning they're lying. Or maybe the lighting in the room made the chin thing look more pronounced than it really is. I've also seen people from certain cultures or backgrounds naturally have more sideways glances without it being deceptive—they might just be processing thoughts that way.

Honestly, the lack of other classic "lying" cues makes me second-guess a bit. No fidgeting, no over-the-top smiles, no rapid blinking—those are the things I'd expect to see if someone was really trying to cover something up. But the combination of that chin dip and the sideways glances... it feels like they're holding back a little. Still, it could just be them being quiet or thoughtful. I don't think it's a clear-cut case, but if I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say it's *possible* they're not telling the whole truth, though I wouldn't bet on it without more context. It's definitely not as obvious as some deception clips I've seen where people are sweating or avoiding eye contact completely. This feels more like a subtle hesitation—maybe they're trying to be careful with their words rather than outright lying. But yeah, I'm not confident enough to say for sure.

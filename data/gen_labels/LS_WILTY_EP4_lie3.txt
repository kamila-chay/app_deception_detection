Hmm, I'm watching this video and honestly, I'm a bit stuck on whether this person is lying or not. On one hand, they're making solid eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—and they're keeping their arms open, which usually feels like someone being open and not hiding anything. Plus, they're tilting their head like they're genuinely engaged, which often happens when people are being truthful. That part makes me think they might be telling the truth.

But then there's this weird thing with their mouth. They're smiling (lip corners up) but also kind of frowning at the same time (lip corners down), which just looks... off. I've read that when people are lying, they sometimes show mixed expressions because they're trying to fake a smile but their stress leaks through. It's like their face isn't matching what they're saying, which feels like a sign of deception. And they're glancing down occasionally too—maybe they're avoiding eye contact when they're not being direct? Though they're still looking at the person overall, so it's not a full avoidance.

Still, I'm not convinced. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're nervous about the topic but not lying. The chin moving up could be confidence, not deception, and the open arms definitely don't scream "liar." Truth-tellers often look people in the eye and keep their posture relaxed. I keep going back and forth—could be they're hiding something, but it could also just be a weird moment of mixed feelings. Without more context, like what they're actually saying, it's hard to say for sure. I'd lean toward deception because of that mouth thing, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It feels like a maybe.

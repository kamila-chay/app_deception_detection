After watching the clip several times, I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive, though I wouldn't say that with complete certainty. Their behavior strikes me as somewhat unusual: they raise their eyebrows frequently throughout their response and blink much more than seems typical. These actions can suggest stress or discomfort, which are often linked to someone trying to hide the truth. The way they close their eyes tightly for slightly too long and shake their head while saying “no” or something similar also points to signs commonly associated with unease or possible dishonesty. Additionally, their sideways glances, despite attempting to maintain eye contact, come across as somewhat forced, as if they are struggling to present a genuine front.

That said, there is some room for doubt. It's plausible that they are naturally expressive or anxious, which can provoke similar reactions even when someone is being truthful. The eyebrow-raising might stem from surprise or confusion rather than deceit. The head moving backward could simply reflect discomfort with the subject at hand, not necessarily because of lying. After all, people often physically pull away when confronted with an uncomfortable topic without intending to deceive.

Their gaze remains mostly directed toward the person they're speaking to, which feels typical for a conversation, not an outright sign of lying. If they had entirely avoided eye contact, suspicion would be stronger. Here, it seems like they want to engage but are having trouble maintaining composure.

Overall, while there are several behaviors that align with common indicators of deception, it's also quite possible these are manifestations of anxiety or nervousness. I lean toward thinking they might not be truthful, given the pattern of cues, but without more context, particularly about what exactly is being said, I can't be sure. The evidence tilts toward deception, but it isn't definitive.

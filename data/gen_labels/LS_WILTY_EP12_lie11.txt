Hmm, I've been watching this clip a few times now, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. The person seems a bit off, but I'm not 100% sure. I noticed they were raising their eyebrows a lot—like, consistently throughout the response—and blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying not to look directly at the camera. That made me lean toward "maybe lying," because when people are stressed or hiding something, they often do that. Then there's the exaggerated eye closing, like they're squeezing their eyes shut for a second too long, and the head shaking when they say "no" or something—those feel like classic signs of discomfort. Plus, they kept glancing sideways while still trying to look at the person they're talking to, which seems kind of forced.  

But here's where I hesitate: maybe they're just naturally expressive? I've seen people with high anxiety do all that stuff even when they're telling the truth—like, they might be nervous about the whole situation, not about the lie. The eyebrow-raising could just be surprise at the question, not deception. And the head moving backward? That might just be them leaning away because they're uncomfortable with the topic, not because they're lying. I mean, if someone's asking you something you don't want to answer, you might physically pull back without even thinking.  

Also, the gaze toward the interlocutor was there most of the time, which feels normal for a conversation, so that doesn't scream "lying" to me. If they were avoiding eye contact entirely, that'd be more suspicious, but they were trying to look at the person, just with those sideways glances mixed in. It's like they're trying to be engaged but can't quite hold it together.  

Honestly, I'm split. On one hand, the frequent blinking and head shaking feel like red flags. On the other, it's easy to overread nervousness as deception when it's just someone who's anxious by nature. I'd probably say "maybe" they're lying—not because I'm certain, but because the behaviors align more with what I've heard about deception cues, even if they could have other explanations. But I'd want to see more context, like what they're actually saying, before I'd feel confident. It's not clear-cut at all.

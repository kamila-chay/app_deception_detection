Looking at the clip, I'm trying to piece together what's happening here. The person seems pretty animated with their head—nodding while also moving it forward and backward at the same time, like they're leaning in and out slightly as they talk. That feels a bit unusual, not the natural nod people usually do when agreeing. And then there's the head shaking—definitely shaking it side-to-side while they're speaking, which is a strong "no" gesture. If they're saying something positive like "I definitely did that," but shaking their head like they're denying it, that inconsistency sticks out. Their eyebrows are raised too, which often shows surprise or skepticism, but I'm not sure if that's genuine surprise at what they're saying or just nervous energy.

On the other hand, their palms are up, which people often do when they're trying to seem open and honest—like they're saying "I'm telling the truth." They're not smiling or laughing, which is interesting because sometimes people fake smiles when lying, but here they're not doing that at all. The lack of awkward pauses or lip movements (like biting or tightening) also feels a bit neutral—maybe they're just speaking calmly. I wonder if the head movements are just their natural way of talking, not necessarily deceptive. Some people gesture like that without meaning anything by it, and the palm-up could just be a habit, not a sign of truthfulness. 

The head shaking is the biggest red flag for me—it's such a clear "no" signal, so if they're contradicting themselves with their words, that feels like a strong sign they're not being straight. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're just emphasizing a point, or maybe the head shaking is cultural or just part of their speech rhythm. Without hearing what they're saying, it's hard to tell if the gesture actually contradicts their words. I'd be hesitant to call it a lie for sure, but the combination of the head shake, the odd head movements, and the raised eyebrows makes me lean toward thinking they're not being fully truthful. Still, it's not obvious enough to be certain—like, it could just be a nervous person talking, not someone actively lying. I'd say it's a maybe, but leaning toward deception based on what I'm seeing.

Watching the clip, I'm really trying to figure this out. The person seems a bit tense—like they're blinking way more than usual, almost like they're trying to avoid looking directly at the camera. That *could* be a sign of stress or maybe even deception, since people sometimes blink more when they're not being honest. But honestly, I've seen people blink like that all the time when they're just tired or in a bright room, so it’s not a slam dunk.  

Then there’s the way they keep glancing sideways instead of meeting the camera head-on. That’s another thing that makes me pause—people often look away when they’re lying, but it could also just mean they’re thinking hard or feeling awkward about the question. They’re nodding a lot, which feels natural in conversation, but I wonder if it’s a little *too* eager, like they’re trying to convince themselves or the viewer. And the head tilting and side-turning? That’s common when someone’s engaged or processing something, not necessarily deceptive.  

But here’s the thing: they’re not doing any of the classic "lie signs" you’d expect. No frowning, no forced smiles, no lip-biting, no obvious nervous gestures like fiddling with their hands. If they were lying, I’d expect more of those tells, like avoiding eye contact entirely or having a stiff posture. Instead, they seem... just uncomfortable, maybe. Like they’re not used to being on camera or they’re genuinely unsure how to answer.  

On the flip side, the frequent blinking and sideways gaze *could* add up if they’re trying to hide something. But I’m not convinced. It feels more like nervousness than deception—like they’re just anxious about the situation, not actively lying. I keep going back and forth because it’s so ambiguous. Maybe they’re not lying at all, and I’m just overthinking the blinking. Or maybe they are, but it’s subtle. Honestly, without more context, I’d say it’s a maybe—leaning toward "not lying" because the other signs are missing, but I’d need to see more of the clip to be sure. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want to ask them directly to be certain.

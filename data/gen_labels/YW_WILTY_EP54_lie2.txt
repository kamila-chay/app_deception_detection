Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, honestly. At first glance, the person seems pretty composed—like they're actually listening and engaging. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which often feels like a sign of honesty to me, though I know that's not always true. They're nodding along too, which usually means they're following the conversation, not trying to hide something. And their mouth is just... neutral? Like, they're not smiling broadly or frowning, which makes me think they're not trying too hard to seem friendly or upset. 

But then there's that thing with the eyebrows—raised up a bit, like they're surprised or skeptical about what's being said. I've seen that before when people are caught off guard, but it could also be a nervous tic. And the lip corners are pulled up slightly, which is weird because it's not a full smile, just a tiny lift. It feels a little forced, like they're trying to look calm or agreeable, but it doesn't quite match the rest of their face. I keep wondering if that's just them being naturally expressive, though. Some people just have that way of moving their lips when they're thinking. 

The thing that really throws me is how *not* many classic "liar" signs are there. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no rapid blinking. Most people expect liars to look away or fiddle with their hands, so the absence of that makes me lean toward them being honest. But then I remember reading that some people *do* overcompensate—like staring too hard or smiling too much to seem credible. So maybe that raised eyebrow and the slight lip lift are their way of trying too hard? 

Still, I'm not sure. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension—like their voice might crack or their hands might move more. But here, it all feels... quiet. Like they're just calmly answering, no big reactions. Maybe it's because the question wasn't that loaded? Or maybe they're just really good at hiding it. Honestly, without knowing what they're being asked about, it's hard to say. I'd probably need to hear the actual words or see more of the context to feel confident. Right now, it feels like they're being genuine, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those "could go either way" moments where you just have to trust your gut, and mine's leaning neutral—like they're telling the truth, but I can't rule out that they're just really practiced at hiding it.

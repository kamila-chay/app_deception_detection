Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip and trying to figure out if they're lying, but honestly, I'm not totally sure. The thing that stands out most is how they're looking—like, they keep raising their eyebrows a bit, and their eyes are darting up and sideways instead of staying on the person they're talking to. That makes me think maybe they're not being completely straightforward, because people often look away or up when they're trying to remember something they're making up. But wait, I've also heard that looking up can sometimes just mean someone's thinking hard about something they actually remember, like trying to recall a detail—so that could be innocent. 

Then there's the eyebrow thing. They're raising them, which feels a bit nervous, but it's not like a full, fake smile or anything. And honestly, they're not doing any of the other classic "lying" stuff I've seen before—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced laughter or scowling. They seem pretty calm otherwise, which actually makes me wonder if it's the opposite: maybe they're too relaxed to be lying? Like, if someone's trying to hide something, they often get jumpy or overcompensate. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so that doesn't rule it out. 

I keep circling back to the gaze. If they were being truthful, you'd expect them to look at the person they're talking to more, right? But they're avoiding it, glancing sideways a lot. That *does* feel like a red flag. But I'm also thinking—maybe they're just shy, or maybe they're not used to being on camera, so they're distracted. Like, I've definitely done that before when I'm trying to answer a question without messing up. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The lack of other nervous tells makes me lean toward "probably telling the truth," but the way they're not meeting the gaze... that's nagging at me. It's not a clear-cut case, and I wouldn't bet money on it either way. I'd say it's a maybe—could be deception, but it could just be someone who's not great at eye contact. I guess I'd have to see more of the context to feel confident.

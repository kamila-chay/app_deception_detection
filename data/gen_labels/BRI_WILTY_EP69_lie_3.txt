This is a bit complicated, but leaning towards the idea that the person might be lying. Their behavior, especially the way they keep raising their eyebrows and frequently looking up and sideways rather than maintaining eye contact, suggests they could be avoiding the truth. Typically, people who fabricate stories often display this kind of gaze pattern, as if they’re trying to piece together something not entirely genuine. While it’s true that looking up can sometimes indicate someone is simply recalling a real memory, in this context, the sideways glances combined with the eyebrow raises feel more like subtle signs of discomfort or deception.

Interestingly, they don’t show the more obvious signs of lying—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced emotions—which could mean they’re just good at hiding dishonesty. Their calmness might even be a form of control to mask what they're really feeling. On the other hand, it’s possible they’re just shy or uneasy about being on camera, which could explain the lack of direct eye contact. However, when you consider the whole picture, the avoidance of meeting the gaze does stand out as a potential red flag.

So, while it’s not entirely definitive, the balance of these clues tends to nudge me towards thinking they might not be completely truthful here. I wouldn’t say it’s certain, but based on the way they behave, deception feels like a plausible explanation.

Looking at the clip, I'm not entirely sure, but I'd lean toward deception based on what I'm seeing. The person seems really focused on the person they're talking to—like they're locking eyes and not looking away, which is interesting because I've heard that avoiding eye contact is often a sign of lying, but here they're actually staring right at the other person. That part feels a bit off, like maybe they're trying *too* hard to seem honest. And their eyebrows are constantly furrowed—like they're stressed or frustrated while answering, not relaxed or casual. It’s not a full scowl, but that tightness around the eyes sticks out, especially since they’re not smiling or laughing at all, which makes me wonder if they’re trying to suppress something.

But here’s where I hesitate: maybe they’re just genuinely upset or confused about the question, not lying. I’ve seen people frown when they’re thinking hard or when they’re being asked something they don’t want to answer, even if they’re telling the truth. And the direct eye contact could just mean they’re being defensive or serious, not deceptive. Like, if someone’s nervous about being accused of something, they might stare to prove they’re not hiding anything. It’s also weird that they’re not doing any of the classic "lying tells"—no blinking a lot, no fidgeting, no fake smiles. So maybe the frown is just their normal expression when they’re concentrating, and the eye contact is just them trying to be polite or engaged.

Honestly, it’s a toss-up. The frown and the unwavering gaze make me think deception, but the *lack* of other cues makes me second-guess. If I had to guess, I’d say maybe they’re not lying, but the way they’re staring while frowning feels... rehearsed? Like they’re forcing themselves to look calm while they’re actually stressed about the lie. But I’m not confident at all—I could easily be wrong. It’s the kind of thing where if I saw the whole conversation, it might make more sense. For now, I’m leaning toward deception, but I’d want more context before I’d be sure.

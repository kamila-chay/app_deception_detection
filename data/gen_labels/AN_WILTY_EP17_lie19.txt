Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly hard to say for sure if they're lying or not. On one hand, there are some things that make me pause—like when they keep protruding their lips a bit, almost like they're pressing them out while they talk. That sometimes happens when people are trying to hold back words or feeling uncomfortable, and the way their chin moves up slightly while they're speaking feels a little tense, not relaxed. Then there's the head moving backward and tilting sideways a couple of times—they don't look away completely, but it’s not the steady eye contact you'd expect from someone being fully open. It’s like they're subtly pulling back from the conversation.

But here's where I get stuck: they're keeping their palms up and arms wide open the whole time, which usually signals honesty or openness, and they're making consistent eye contact with whoever's talking to them. That feels like they're trying to seem genuine. And the head side-turning? It could just be a natural habit for them—some people do that when thinking, not necessarily because they're hiding something. I've seen people with nervous habits that look suspicious but are totally harmless.

Honestly, the most I can say is that it *feels* a little off—like they're not entirely at ease—but it's not screaming "liar" to me. The open posture and eye contact make it hard to dismiss it as deception, especially since so many of those "deceptive" cues (like lip protrusion) can just be their normal way of speaking. Maybe they're just nervous about the question, or maybe they're genuinely trying to be honest but struggling to express it. Without knowing what they're being asked about or seeing their full context, I'd lean toward "not sure" rather than "lying." It’s the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to make sense of it.

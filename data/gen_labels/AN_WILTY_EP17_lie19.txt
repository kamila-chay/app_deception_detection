Based on the video, I’m leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. Certain behaviors give me pause, like the way they repeatedly protrude their lips, almost pressing them out as they speak, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or an effort to hold back information. Their chin also moves up slightly in a somewhat tense manner rather than looking relaxed. The backward movement and slight tilt of the head, while not a full avoidance of eye contact, suggest a subtle withdrawal from the conversation rather than openness.

Still, there are factors that complicate this interpretation. Their palms remain open and arms wide throughout, typically a sign of honesty, and they maintain steady eye contact, which usually signals genuineness. The head tilting could simply be a habitual gesture rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive. Given these signals, it’s difficult to conclude definitively that they’re lying.

Overall, while some indicators point toward possible deception, others lean toward openness, making me inclined to suspect that they might not be fully truthful, but I wouldn’t say this with complete confidence. The combination of tension cues and ambiguous openness leads me to lean slightly toward deception, though it remains a tentative judgment without more context or information.

Hmm, this is tricky. So I'm watching this person talk, and the first thing I notice is they're not making eye contact at all—they keep looking down, like at their hands or the floor, the whole time. That's the only thing standing out, really. I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, so that *could* be a red flag. But then I'm also thinking, maybe they're just shy, or maybe they're really focused on what they're saying and don't want to be distracted by looking at the camera. I've seen people do that when they're trying to recall something or just feel uncomfortable speaking directly.

But here's where it gets confusing: they're not doing any of the other stuff people usually associate with lying. No fidgeting with their hands, no weird smiles, no obvious pauses where they're trying to think of a story. They seem pretty calm, actually—no sweating, no twitching, no avoiding their mouth like they're hiding something. Sometimes when people are lying, they *do* try to act extra natural, but they end up doing things like over-smiling or blinking a lot, and this person isn't doing any of that. So maybe they're not lying? Or maybe they're really good at hiding it.

I keep circling back to the eye contact thing. If they were telling the truth, why would they keep looking down? But then again, I've known people who just *always* look down when they talk, no matter what they're saying. It could be a habit, not a sign of deception. And since there's no other nervousness, it's hard to say if the downcast gaze is because they're lying or just because that's how they are. Truth-tellers sometimes look down too, especially if they're thinking or being humble. 

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The lack of other signs makes me lean toward "maybe not lying," but the consistent gaze-down feels off. I wouldn't bet money on it either way. If I had to guess? I'd say it's possible they're being deceptive, but it's also totally possible they're just a quiet person. I'd need to hear what they're actually saying to be sure, because behavior alone is so unreliable. Like, I mean, I've seen people who *never* look up when they talk, and they're completely honest. So yeah, I'm really not sure. It could go either way.

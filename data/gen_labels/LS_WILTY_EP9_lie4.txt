Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—I'd say it's a maybe. The person's maintaining direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels a bit unusual if they're being deceptive since a lot of people look away when they're not being honest. But they're also nodding a lot while speaking, which could just be natural conversation rhythm, or maybe they're trying too hard to seem engaged. 

What stands out to me more are the hand movements. They keep scratching their head and touching their face/body, and at one point they actually cover their mouth with their hand. I've heard that covering the mouth can sometimes be a sign of trying to hold back words, like when someone's nervous about what they're saying. The raised eyebrows too—they seem a little tense or surprised, which could be genuine, but it also feels like it might be a nervous tic. 

But I'm not convinced it's definitive. Maybe they're just really anxious about being filmed, or they have an itchy spot on their neck that they're constantly scratching. Covering the mouth could even be for a different reason—like they're adjusting their glasses or just have a habit of touching their face when they talk. And the direct gaze... I've read that some people who lie actually *overcompensate* with eye contact to seem more trustworthy, so that might not rule out deception at all. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The hand stuff makes me lean toward "maybe lying," but the eye contact and nodding make me hesitate. I wouldn't bet on it either way because these cues can mean so many things depending on the person. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're being deceptive, but I wouldn't call it certain. There's just too much room for other explanations with what I'm seeing.

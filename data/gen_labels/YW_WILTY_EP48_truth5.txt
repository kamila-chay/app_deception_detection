Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% certain, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth. The way they're holding their body feels open and engaged—arms are fully open, palms are up like they're being transparent, and they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to. That kind of posture usually matches honesty, not deception. I don't see any of the classic "nervous" tells people often associate with lying: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no weird mouth movements or excessive blinking. They're actually speaking smoothly, which makes me think they're not scrambling for words or trying to cover something up.

But I can see why someone might hesitate. That head shaking is a little confusing—I'm not sure if it's a "no" or just a habitual gesture, but it's not the kind of head movement I'd usually link to lying. Sometimes people shake their head when they're emphasizing a point, even when they're being truthful. And honestly, without knowing the exact question they're answering, it's hard to say if that shake fits with what they're saying. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like crossing arms or looking away, but they're not doing that. The only thing that makes me second-guess is that head movement—it’s the only thing that doesn't scream "truth" to me, but it’s not screaming "lie" either. 

So yeah, all the cues I can see point toward truth, but I’d still say it’s not a slam dunk. People can be nervous without seeming like they’re lying, and context matters a lot. If I had to guess based on this alone, I’d say they’re probably being honest, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It just feels... calm, which is what truth usually looks like to me.

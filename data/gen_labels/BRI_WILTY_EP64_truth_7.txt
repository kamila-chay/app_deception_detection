I'm watching this video and trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. They're speaking calmly, and I don't see any obvious signs like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting with their hands in a way that seems exaggerated, or any nervous ticks like rapid blinking. The only thing I notice is they're scratching their hands a couple of times—once near their ear, and again on their forearm. Now, scratching can be a red flag for some people because it's often linked to nervousness, which might hint at lying. But honestly, I've seen plenty of videos where people scratch because of an itch, or maybe they're just restless without any ulterior motive. I mean, I've scratched my own hands when I'm just bored or thinking, so it doesn't necessarily mean they're hiding something.  

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect to see more signs—like avoiding eye contact, shifting in their seat, or maybe even a slight frown. But here, they're mostly looking at the camera, their posture is relaxed, and they don't seem to be struggling with their words. The scratching feels kind of casual, not like they're trying to cover up something. I guess I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because there's no buildup of other deceptive cues, but I can't rule out lying entirely. Maybe they're just naturally a bit twitchy, or the scratching was completely unrelated to what they're saying. It's hard to say for sure with just one little gesture—I'd need more context or more video to feel confident. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I see, I'd guess they're being truthful.

Watching this clip, the first thing that stands out is how the person keeps looking upward—like they're staring at the ceiling or sky while they talk. I've heard that when people recall real memories, they often glance up like that, almost like they're mentally flipping through a file. It's kind of the opposite of what you'd expect if they were making something up, which usually involves more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. Here, they're totally still—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no nervous smiles or frowns. That calmness makes me lean toward truth, because liars often seem tense or try to overcompensate with fake expressions.  

But honestly, I'm not totally sure. I've also read that some people *practice* looking up when they lie to seem more sincere, like they're "thinking hard" to sound convincing. And it's possible they're just really good at hiding stress—some people don't show physical signs of lying at all. The lack of eye contact with the camera (they're not looking at the person they're talking to, just up) could go either way: it might mean they're focused on remembering, or it could mean they're avoiding being caught.  

I'd say the upward gaze is the strongest clue here—it feels more natural for truth-telling than lying, especially paired with how relaxed they seem. But I wouldn't say for certain. If I had to guess based on just this clip? I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context—like if they're answering a simple question versus something tricky. It's not a slam dunk, though. Sometimes people look up for totally unrelated reasons, like they're just daydreaming. So yeah, I'm probably about 60-70% on truth, but I'd hesitate to call it a solid "yes" without more to go on.

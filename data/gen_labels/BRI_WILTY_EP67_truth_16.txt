Watching the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. At first glance, they seem a bit uneasy—like they're looking sideways instead of directly at whoever they're talking to, which sometimes happens when people are avoiding eye contact. And they've got their hands covering their mouth and face a little, which I've heard people say can be a sign of nervousness or even trying to hold back words. But then there's this detail where their palms are up, like they're open or trying to seem honest, which feels kind of contradictory to the mouth-covering. 

I keep thinking about why they might be doing that. Maybe they're just naturally fidgety, or maybe they're trying to suppress a laugh or a sigh? The description says no laughter or smiling, so it's not like they're being overly expressive. They're not frowning or raising eyebrows either—those are usually bigger red flags for deception. Their body language feels pretty calm overall, except for that sideways gaze and the hand thing. 

But here's where I get stuck: covering the mouth *can* be linked to lying in some contexts, but I've read that it's super unreliable. People do it when they're embarrassed, tired, or just adjusting their face—like if they have a crumb on their lip. And the palms-up part makes me wonder if they're actually trying to seem sincere, which might mean they're not lying. If they were being deceptive, I'd expect more obvious signs, like avoiding eye contact *and* looking stressed or fidgeting more. But here, they seem... steady? Like they're just a bit uncomfortable, not actively hiding something. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The sideways gaze could be shyness, or it could be evasion. The hand covering feels like it might be a habit, not a lie signal. I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because there's nothing *really* screaming "deception" here—no exaggerated movements, no awkward pauses, no signs of panic. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation, not the truth of what they're saying. I'd guess truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to be confident. It's one of those cases where it's probably not a lie, but I can't rule out that they're just... off-balance.

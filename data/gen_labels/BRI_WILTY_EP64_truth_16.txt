Looking at the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. The most noticeable thing is how often they're blinking—like, way more than normal, almost like they're trying to avoid looking at something. I've heard people say that frequent blinking can be a sign of stress or lying, so that's what jumped out at me first. But then... there's nothing else going on that screams "this person is hiding something." They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact (they're actually looking pretty steady at the camera, I think), not crossing their arms or doing any of those nervous little tells people usually have. 

If they *were* lying, I'd expect more signs—like maybe shifting in their seat, or a forced smile, or even just a pause where they're trying to think of a story. But here, they seem pretty calm and direct. Maybe the blinking is just because they're tired, or maybe they have dry eyes, or it's just how they naturally talk. Honestly, I've seen people blink a lot when they're telling the truth too, especially if they're focused on what they're saying. 

On the flip side, if they *are* lying, it's weird they're not showing *any* other signs. Most people who lie at least have *one* of those little nervous habits—like touching their face or looking away. The fact that they're not doing any of that makes me lean toward them being honest, even with the blinking. It's like they're so relaxed about it that the blinking doesn't even feel like a tell. 

I guess I'm stuck between "they're probably telling the truth because they're not acting nervous" and "the blinking is weird, so maybe they're hiding something." But I don't think I'd feel confident calling it either way. If I had to guess, I'd say truth—because the lack of other signs feels more significant to me than the blinking alone—but I'd definitely want to see more context before I'd be sure. Like, what are they even talking about? If it's a neutral topic, the blinking might just be a habit. If it's something high-stakes, it's harder to say. Yeah, I'd say truth, but with a lot of "maybe."

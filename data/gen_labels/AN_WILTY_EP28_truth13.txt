Honestly, it's a bit tricky without knowing the context of what they're saying, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The way they're sitting—arms wide open, not crossed or folded—feels genuinely relaxed and open, which usually goes against the typical "closed-off" body language people show when they're hiding something. They're also making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which is a strong sign of honesty in most conversations, even if they do occasionally glance sideways, which I've noticed people do naturally when thinking or shifting focus, not necessarily when lying. And the head shaking? It doesn't look like a nervous tic—it seems like a deliberate "no" or emphasis, which fits with someone confidently disagreeing or clarifying, not someone trying to cover up a lie.  

But I can see why someone might doubt it too. Head shaking *can* sometimes be a sign of deception in certain contexts, like if they're denying something they're guilty of, so I wouldn't rule that out entirely. And that sideways glance? It might look a little evasive at first, but honestly, people do that all the time when they're speaking—like if they're glancing at notes or just naturally moving their eyes while thinking. I've seen a lot of truthful people do that, especially in casual talks. Also, the lack of fidgeting or nervous gestures (no hand rubbing, no lip biting, no rapid blinking) really stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little "tells," like covering their mouth or avoiding eye contact altogether. Here, they're just... calm.  

Still, I'm not 100% certain. Truthful people can get nervous too, and context matters a lot—like, if they're denying something they *know* is true (like "I didn't steal the cookies!"), the head shake might feel off. But based *just* on the body language here, it feels more like someone being straightforward. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel completely sure. It’s the absence of the red flags, not the presence of anything super obvious—like, no one's sweating or looking away for long, which is what I'd expect if they were lying. So yeah, I think they're being honest, but I'd keep an open mind.

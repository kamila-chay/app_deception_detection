Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. The person's face is really tense—there's a definite scowl and those tight frowning eyebrows the whole time, like they're genuinely annoyed or frustrated about whatever they're talking about. And they keep closing their eyes really exaggeratedly, almost like they're trying to shut something out or block a thought, which feels odd. But here's where it gets confusing: they're also making steady eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which usually leans toward truthfulness—liars often avoid looking directly at people. 

I'm hesitating because that scowl and the exaggerated eye-closing *could* be signs of deception—maybe they're nervous about the topic or trying to hide something. But honestly, it could just be that they're really upset about the subject they're discussing, not necessarily lying. Like, if someone asked them a question they find offensive or stressful, they might scowl and squint their eyes shut without lying. The steady eye contact makes me think they're trying to seem sincere, which sometimes happens when people are lying, but it also happens when they're just being earnest. 

I keep circling back to the eye-closing—it's so noticeable and unnatural. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, not this specific, dramatic shutting of the eyes. Maybe it's a nervous habit? Or maybe they're just tired? The lack of other classic signs like fidgeting, forced smiles, or shaky voice (which I can't hear, but the description says no laughter or awkward pauses) makes it feel less like a clear deception signal. 

Honestly, I'm not sure. It feels more like they're genuinely frustrated with the situation than actively lying. But I can't rule out deception entirely—it's hard to tell from just the face, especially with that weird eye-closing thing. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward "not lying" because of the eye contact, but I'd be really cautious about it. It's one of those cases where the behavior feels more like emotional reaction than deception. Maybe the video's context would help—like what they're even talking about—but based on what I see, I'd hesitate to call it deception.

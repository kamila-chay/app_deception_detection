Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn. The person is looking straight at the camera the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so that's interesting because I'd expect someone lying to glance away more often. But then their head... it's doing this weird thing. It keeps moving forward like they're leaning in, then snapping back like they're pulling away. Like, *forward, back, forward, back*—not smooth, almost like a little twitch. I've seen people do that when they're trying too hard to seem engaged or sincere, but it also feels off. If they were totally relaxed, they'd probably just sit still. 

Then there's the palms up thing—they're holding their hands open, facing up. I know some people say that's a sign of openness, like "I'm not hiding anything," but I've also heard it can be a fake signal, like they're overdoing the "trust me" thing. It's not a clear sign either way, though. And no other tells—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. So it's not like they're obviously flustered. 

But here's where I'm stuck: if they were telling the truth, why would they move their head like that? It feels unnatural, like they're rehearsing how to look honest. But on the flip side, maybe they're just a very animated person—some folks naturally gesture with their head when they talk, even when they're not lying. I mean, I've seen friends do that when they're excited about something, and it's totally normal. 

I also wonder if the head movement is tied to the palms-up thing. Like, they might be trying to project calmness (palms up) but their body's betraying them with that jerky head motion. But I can't be sure. The lack of other classic signs (like avoiding eye contact or lip-biting) makes me lean toward "maybe not lying," but that head thing... it’s nagging at me. It’s not something I’d see in a relaxed, truthful conversation. 

Honestly, I’m not 100% sure. It could be nervousness about the topic—not deception—making them move like that. Or it could be the opposite: they’re trying so hard to seem truthful that it’s backfiring. I’d say the behavior is *slightly* more suggestive of deception than truth, but it’s so subtle and ambiguous that I wouldn’t bet on it. If I had to guess? I’d lean toward deception, but I’d be pretty hesitant to say it’s definite. It’s one of those "something feels off, but I can’t put my finger on why" situations.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty steady while talking. They're looking directly at the person they're speaking to the whole time—no shifting eyes or avoiding contact—and their eyebrows are actually raised a bit, like they're genuinely surprised or emphasizing something. That feels more like someone being honest about a real moment, not someone rehearsing a lie. When people are lying, they often fidget, smile too much to seem relaxed, or avoid eye contact, but here they're not doing any of that. The lack of nervous habits like touching their face or blinking a lot also makes it seem like they're not stressed about what they're saying.

But I'm not totally sure, because sometimes people who lie can *practice* looking calm and direct, especially if they're used to it. And the fact that they're not smiling or laughing at all—well, that could just mean they're being serious about the topic, but it might also feel a bit stiff or unnatural if they're trying too hard to seem truthful. I've seen people who are actually telling the truth just be quiet or serious in the moment, so it doesn't necessarily mean they're hiding something. Honestly, the raised eyebrows stand out to me as a genuine reaction—like they're processing what they're saying in real time, not just reciting a script. All the other cues point to calm, engaged communication, not the usual signs of deception. It feels like they're telling the truth, but I can't rule out that they might be a really good actor. Still, based on what I see, it seems more likely they're being honest than not.

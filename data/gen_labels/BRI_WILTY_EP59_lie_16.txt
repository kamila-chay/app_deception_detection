Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure. The person seems pretty calm on the surface—no obvious signs like frowning or avoiding eye contact, which I'd usually expect if someone was lying. But there's something off about their eyes. They keep raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're surprised or maybe trying to seem engaged, and they're blinking way more than normal—like, almost constantly. That makes me wonder if they're nervous, which sometimes happens when people are stretching the truth. 

But here's where I get stuck: I've seen people do that all the time when they're just thinking hard or maybe even a bit tired. Like, if you're trying to remember something or feel a little stressed about the situation, your eyebrows might go up and your eyes might blink faster. It doesn't *have* to mean they're lying. And their gaze? They're actually looking right at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels more honest to me than avoiding eye contact. They also glance up and down a few times, but I've heard that "looking up" is supposed to be a lie tell—though I'm not sure I trust that myth. It could just be them recalling details, like anyone would do when answering a question. 

The thing that keeps me hesitant is how *lack* of other tells there are. No fidgeting, no tight lips, no fake smiles. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical cues, like shifting in their seat or covering their mouth. But they're just sitting there, talking normally, with those raised brows and blinking. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're genuinely trying to be clear and it's making them a little tense. I mean, I've had to give interviews before and my eyes would do the same thing—I wasn't lying, I was just trying to get my words right. 

So yeah, I'd lean toward them *not* lying, but I'm not confident. The blinking and eyebrows feel like nervous energy, but not necessarily deception. It could easily be something else. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context—like what the question was or how they act in other situations—before I'd feel sure. It's just one of those moments where your gut says "hmm" but you can't really prove it.

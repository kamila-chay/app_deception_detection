This is a bit challenging. Watching the clip, I notice the person appears calm on the surface—no obvious signs like frowning or avoiding eye contact that typically suggest dishonesty. However, there’s something unusual about their eyes. They raise their eyebrows frequently, almost as if trying to appear surprised or engaged, and they blink far more than normal, nearly constantly. This kind of nervous behavior can sometimes indicate someone is not being entirely truthful.

That said, I recognize these cues can also occur when someone is simply thinking hard or feeling a bit stressed or tired. Raised eyebrows and increased blinking might not necessarily mean they are lying. Their direct gaze is interesting too; usually, maintaining eye contact suggests honesty more than avoiding it does. They do glance up and down a few times, which some say is linked to deception, though that might be myth. It could just as well be a sign they’re recalling information carefully.

What makes me pause is the lack of other typical signs of lying—no fidgeting, no tight lips, no forced smiles. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical discomfort, like shifting or covering their mouth. Instead, they’re relatively still except for those frequent blinks and raised eyebrows. Perhaps this person is naturally expressive, or genuinely trying to communicate clearly but feels tense. I’ve experienced similar eye behavior when I’m under pressure to answer properly, without lying.

Still, weighing these observations, I tend to lean toward suspicion. The blinking and eyebrow movements feel like nervous energy that could be linked to deception, even if it isn’t definitive. Without additional context—like the question asked or how they behave in other situations—it’s hard to be sure. Overall, I lean slightly toward the idea that they might be stretching the truth, though it’s definitely not conclusive.

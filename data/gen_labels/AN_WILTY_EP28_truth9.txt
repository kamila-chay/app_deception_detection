Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure—I'd need to hear the actual question they're answering to be more certain. The most striking thing is how they're laughing while responding, which feels pretty genuine to me. People don't usually laugh *during* a lie unless they're trying to mask discomfort, but this laugh seems relaxed, like they're reacting to something the questioner said, not forced. Their eyes also stay mostly on the person asking, which is a good sign—liars often avoid direct eye contact, though not always. I noticed they raised their eyebrows a couple times too, which might just mean they're surprised or processing the question, not necessarily lying.  

That said, there are a few things that make me hesitate. Their head turns sideways a couple times, which some people associate with lying, but I've seen that happen when people are just thinking or gesturing naturally—especially if they're not used to being recorded. And the chin moving up (like they're holding their head steady confidently) could be a habit, not a clue. I also wonder if the "lip corners up" smile is a nervous tic rather than genuine happiness, though it doesn't look forced like some fake smiles do.  

Honestly, the laughter and the consistent eye contact feel stronger than the sideways head turns. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension—like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact—but they seem pretty calm. Still, I can't rule out that the laugh might be a nervous reaction to the question itself. Maybe they're just relieved to be answering honestly, or the question caught them off guard in a funny way. Without knowing what they're being asked, it's hard to say for sure, but based on what I see, I'd guess they're telling the truth. It just doesn't feel like the behavior of someone who's hiding something.

Looking at the video, I'm honestly a bit torn on this one. The person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which feels like they're trying to be attentive. Their hands are open with palms up, which usually reads as "I'm being honest" in body language, and their mouth is set in this slight, polite upturn—not a full smile, but not a forced one either. The eyebrows are raised a bit, which can sometimes mean surprise or even nervous energy, but it could also just be them reacting naturally to the question. 

On the flip side, I wonder if that subtle lip corner up is actually a sign they're trying too hard to seem calm. Sometimes when people are lying, they'll overdo the "neutral" expressions to avoid looking guilty, and that tiny smile might be part of that. The direct eye contact also sticks out—some liars actually stare too long to seem credible, so that could be a red flag. But then again, the absence of classic deception tells like fidgeting, avoiding eyes, or fake laughter makes me doubt it. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous habits, like touching their face or shifting in their seat. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them being truthful just because the open palms and steady gaze feel genuine, but I'm not 100% sure. Humans are terrible at reading lies from body language alone—what looks like nervousness to me might just be how they naturally talk. I'd need more context to be confident, but based on what I see here, the lack of obvious "deception cues" tips me toward "they're probably telling the truth," even if I can't rule out that the raised brows are a little off. It's just... hard to say for sure without knowing the situation.

Looking at the video, I find myself leaning more towards the idea that this person might not be entirely truthful. While they do maintain consistent eye contact and have open palms—both of which can suggest honesty—there are subtle signs that give me pause. The slight, polite upturn of their mouth could be an attempt to appear calm, but it also strikes me as possibly forced, as if they're trying too hard to control their expression. Raised eyebrows might indicate surprise or nervousness, but combined with the other cues, it could hint at underlying discomfort or anxiety linked to deception. Also, the steady, direct eye contact might not be as natural as it seems; some people who lie tend to overcompensate by staring more intently to appear credible. Although the person doesn't show more obvious nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the absence of these classic signs doesn't necessarily mean they're honest. Given these mixed signals, I have a feeling they might be leaning towards deception, though I can't say this with full confidence. More context would help, but based on these observations, I lean slightly toward the person possibly not telling the whole truth.

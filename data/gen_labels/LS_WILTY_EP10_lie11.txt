Hmm, this is tricky. So I'm watching someone answer a question, and honestly, I'm not 100% sure. At first glance, they're making direct eye contact with the person asking the question—that's usually a sign of someone trying to be honest, right? Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more often. They're keeping their gaze steady, which feels... genuine? But then there's this thing with their eyebrows—they keep raising them, like they're surprised or maybe trying to seem innocent? I've seen people do that when they're nervous, but it's not a clear red flag. And their chin... it's sort of moving up and down a little, like they're tense or thinking hard. 

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the classic "liar" stuff—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no fake smiles or forced laughter. In fact, they seem pretty calm otherwise, which actually makes me lean toward truth-telling. Most people who lie *do* show more physical signs of stress, like scratching or looking down. But maybe this person's just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or they're just really focused on answering. I mean, I've had moments where I raised my eyebrows when I was trying to remember something, and it wasn't about lying. 

The thing that's throwing me off is that the eye contact is so consistent. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more, especially if they're under pressure. But they're not—so why would they be doing that if they're hiding something? It makes me wonder if the eyebrow thing is just a habit, not a sign of deception. Maybe they're just a little stressed about the question, not lying. 

Honestly, I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'm not totally confident. It's one of those cases where the behavior doesn't scream "lie," but it doesn't *definitely* scream "truth" either. Like, if I had to guess, I'd lean toward truth-telling because of the eye contact, but I'd still be second-guessing the eyebrows. It's not like they're avoiding the question or anything—just... a little extra eyebrow action. Could be nothing. Could be something. Hard to say for sure.

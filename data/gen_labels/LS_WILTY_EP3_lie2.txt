Hmm, looking at this clip... honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person seems to be responding to something, and there's that head shaking—like they're saying "no" or disagreeing with whatever's being asked. That's a bit of a red flag for me because when people are lying, they often subtly disagree with the question itself, even if they're trying to say "yes." But then again, head shaking can just mean they're disagreeing with the *content* of the question, not necessarily lying about it. Like, if someone asks "Did you see the meeting?" and they shake their head "no," that could be truthful disagreement, not deception.

Then there's the lip corners down—like they're frowning a little. At first glance, that feels like discomfort or maybe frustration with the question, which people often show when they're stressed (which lying might cause). But I've seen people do that when they're just tired or annoyed by the whole situation, not because they're hiding something. And that shrug at the end... yeah, that's tricky. Shrug can mean "I don't know," "I don't care," or even "I'm not sure what you're asking." It doesn't scream "lying" to me—it feels more like uncertainty. People shrug all the time when they're not sure how to answer.

I keep circling back to the exaggerated eye opening though. It's really noticeable—like their eyes are wide open, almost startled. That *could* be a sign of heightened emotion, which sometimes happens when lying (like trying too hard to seem sincere). But it could also just be them reacting to a surprising question or trying to look attentive. Like, maybe they're genuinely confused by the question and it's not about deception at all. 

The thing is, without knowing the context of the conversation, it's really hard to tell. If they were asked something super specific they knew the answer to, and they reacted that way, it'd feel more suspicious. But if it's a general question they weren't prepared for, the eye thing might just be natural. And the lip corners down... I've seen people do that when they're just being serious or thoughtful, not deceptive. 

Honestly, I'm leaning a little toward "maybe lying" just because of the combination—head shake, the frown-like lip thing, and that exaggerated eye thing—but I'm not confident. It could totally be them just being nervous or frustrated with the interview setup. Like, maybe they're tired, or the question was poorly phrased, and they're just reacting to that. I'd need to hear the actual question and their answer to be sure. But based *only* on the video, I'd say it's possible they're not being fully truthful, but it's not a clear-cut case. It's one of those things where you'd want to see more of the interaction to really judge.

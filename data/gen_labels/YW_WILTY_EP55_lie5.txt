Looking at the clip, I'm noticing a few things that make me a bit unsure whether they're being truthful or not. They're nodding along and keeping their gaze right on the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of engagement—like they're listening and trying to be sincere. That part makes me lean toward them being honest, because liars often avoid eye contact or seem distracted, but this person seems pretty focused. They're also tilting their head a little, which can come across as curious or empathetic, not like someone who's hiding something.

But then there's this thing with their eyebrows—they're raised pretty consistently, almost like they're surprised or maybe trying to seem innocent. And their lip corners are pulled up just slightly, but it's not a full smile, which feels a bit forced. I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes do little micro-expressions like that to seem friendly while actually being on edge. It's subtle, though, so it could just be them being expressive or genuinely reacting to what's being said. Like, maybe they're just naturally animated, or they really are surprised by the question.

The weird thing is, they don't seem nervous at all—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no avoiding eye contact. Usually, if someone's lying, they might scratch their neck or blink a lot, but here it's all calm. That makes me wonder if they're actually telling the truth and the eyebrow thing is just a coincidence. But then again, sometimes people who lie *try too hard* to seem calm, so the lack of nervousness might be the opposite of what I'd expect. It's really confusing.

I guess I'm stuck between two ideas: one where they're being truthful (because they're engaged and not fidgeting), and another where they're lying (because of that raised-eyebrow thing and the tight lip corners). I'm not 100% sure, but I'd probably lean toward them being truthful just because the overall vibe feels relaxed. Still, that eyebrow detail is bugging me a little—like, it's not *definitely* a lie, but it's not 100% normal either. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're being honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's one of those clips where the behavior is so neutral it's hard to tell.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. At first glance, they seem pretty calm—they're actually making eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually makes me think they're being honest. Like, when people lie, I often notice them avoiding eye contact or looking away a lot, but here they're keeping their gaze directed at the other person most of the time. That feels like it might point to truthfulness. But then, they're also glancing down and sideways a bit, which I've heard can sometimes happen when someone's thinking hard or trying to remember something. It's not like they're darting their eyes around nervously, but those little shifts make me wonder if they're constructing a story instead of just answering naturally.  

On the flip side, though, the fact that they're not fidgeting or showing any obvious signs of stress—no blinking a lot, no hands moving around, no fake smiles—could actually make me lean toward deception. Sometimes people who lie really well are super composed, like they're trying too hard to seem relaxed. I've seen that before, where the person looks *too* calm, and it's the opposite of what I'd expect. So maybe the lack of nervous tells is a red flag, not a sign of truth.  

But here's where I get stuck: the sideways and downward glances might not even mean anything. Some people just naturally look down when they're concentrating, or they might be used to speaking that way. Like, maybe they're just a thoughtful speaker, not a liar. And the eye contact they're maintaining—especially since they're not avoiding it entirely—feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect more of a struggle with the gaze, not this steady-but-not-locked-in way they're looking.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The eye contact is making me lean toward truth, but the subtle gaze shifts and the overall stillness are making me second-guess. I don't think I'd bet on either side with confidence—I'd need more context, like what they're even talking about. If they're just answering a simple question calmly, it probably is true. But if they're dodging a tricky question, those little glances might hint at something. I'd say it's probably not a clear-cut lie, but I can't rule it out either. It's one of those cases where the behavior is so neutral, it's hard to read.

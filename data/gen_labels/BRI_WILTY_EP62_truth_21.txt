Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, they seem really calm. Like, *too* calm maybe? They're just sitting there answering the question without any obvious nervous ticks—no fidgeting, no shifting in their seat, no weird eye movements or over-the-top smiles. They're just... neutral. Not smiling, not frowning, just looking at the camera like they're calmly explaining something. It feels a little odd because most people, even if they're telling the truth, might show *some* small reaction—like a slight head tilt or a natural blink—but here, nothing. Zero.  

That makes me lean toward them telling the truth, honestly. Because liars usually *do* have those little tells—like nervous blinking or fidgeting—if they're not super practiced. But if they're genuinely relaxed, they wouldn't need to fake it. Like, if I were lying about something small, I'd probably tap my foot or avoid eye contact, but this person isn't doing any of that. It just looks... effortless.  

But wait—could it be the opposite? Like, maybe they're *so* good at lying that they've trained themselves to be completely still? I mean, I've heard of people who can control their body language perfectly when they're lying. So maybe they're hiding it so well that the *absence* of signs is actually the tell. That’s a real possibility. It’s hard to rule out, especially since we don’t know the context—like, what are they even talking about? If it’s something super high-stakes, they might be *too* controlled.  

Still, the more I watch, the more I think the calmness feels genuine. Truth-tellers often don’t have to *act* calm—they just *are* calm. Liars usually have to work harder to seem normal, and that effort usually leaks through. Like, if they were lying, I’d expect at least one little thing—maybe a micro-expression or a pause—but there’s nothing. It’s just... quiet. So yeah, I’m leaning toward truth, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t second-guessing it. Hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what’s here, it feels honest.

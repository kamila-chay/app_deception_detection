Looking at the clip, I'm trying to gauge if they're being truthful based on what I'm seeing. The person seems pretty relaxed overall—they're smiling, which feels natural rather than forced, and they're keeping their arms open, which usually signals openness. Their gaze is mostly directed at the person they're talking to, which feels engaged, though there's a bit of sideways glancing too. I've noticed people do that when they're thinking or just speaking casually, not necessarily hiding something. The lack of nervous habits like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or covering their mouth stands out—those are things I've heard can sometimes pop up when someone's lying, but here it's not happening.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. Smiles can be tricky—they might be smiling to seem friendly even if they're not fully honest, especially if they're trying to make a good impression. And that sideways glance? Some people might see that as a sign of distraction or dishonesty, though I've also seen it in lots of normal conversations where someone's just organizing their thoughts. The arms being open definitely feels genuine though—liars often cross their arms or keep them closed as a barrier, so that's a point in their favor.  

Honestly, all the cues I'm picking up lean toward them telling the truth. No red flags like excessive blinking or closed-off body language, and the smile and eye contact seem consistent with someone being comfortable. But I won't say for sure—people can act calm when lying, and context matters a lot. If this were a high-stakes situation, I'd want more to go on, but based on what's visible here, it seems like they're probably being honest. I'd lean toward "truth" myself, but I'd still keep an open mind.

Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there's no obvious nervousness jumping out at me. They're looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which feels like good eye contact—people who are lying sometimes avoid that, but not always. I also notice they're glancing down a few times, which could be a sign they're thinking or being sincere, but it could also be a way to seem more humble or avoid direct confrontation, so I'm not sure about that part.

What stands out more is how still they are. They're not fidgeting, not touching their face, not blinking a lot, and they're not smiling or frowning in a way that seems forced. The absence of those "nervous tells" usually associated with lying is kind of reassuring. Like, if they were making something up, I'd expect them to be a bit more restless or show some micro-expressions. But here, they're just sitting there, maybe a little tense, but not in a way that screams "liar." Their chin actually moves up a bit when they're speaking, which feels like a natural nod or affirmation, not something they're trying to fake.

On the flip side, though, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes people who lie *do* look down to seem less confrontational, so that gaze down might actually be a red herring. And the chin movement—while it looks confident—could be an unconscious attempt to seem more sure of themselves, like they're trying to convince *themselves* they're telling the truth. But honestly, the lack of other signs makes me lean toward them being genuine. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little physical cues, like the eyes darting away or hands fidgeting. Here, it just feels... calm. Like they're just answering a question without any extra stress. 

I'm not 100% sure, obviously—people are complicated, and some liars are really good at hiding it—but based on what I'm watching, it seems more likely they're telling the truth. The way they hold their gaze and stay still just doesn't match the classic "lying" behavior I've seen before. It's not a slam dunk, but it feels like they're being honest.

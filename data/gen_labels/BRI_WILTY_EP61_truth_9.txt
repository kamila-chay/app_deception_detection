Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but after watching this clip a couple times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, though I can see why someone might question it. The thing that stood out most was how they raised their eyebrows a couple of times—like when they were answering that specific part about the event. It didn't feel forced or rehearsed; it seemed more like a natural reaction, almost like they were genuinely surprised by the question or processing it. And honestly, they didn't seem nervous at all—no fidgeting, no weird pauses, no avoiding eye contact (well, they weren't looking directly at the camera, but that's common for people just thinking, not necessarily lying). The lack of those classic "lie signs" like excessive blinking or touching their face makes me think they're not stressed, which usually happens when someone's hiding something.  

But then I keep second-guessing myself because, yeah, some people are really good at faking calmness when they're lying. Like, maybe they're just practiced or really confident in their story, so the absence of obvious tells doesn't prove anything. And the way they kept their gaze down a bit—maybe that's a sign they're not being direct? I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes look away to avoid scrutiny, but I also know that truth-tellers do that too when they're just trying to recall something. It's hard to say for sure.  

Honestly, though, the raised eyebrows felt like the key. If they were lying, I'd expect them to maybe overcompensate with a smile or a little too much eye contact, but they didn't. It just seemed... real. Like they were actually thinking about the question instead of crafting a lie. So yeah, I'm probably going to go with truth, but I'm not 100% locked in—I'd want to hear more of the conversation to be sure. It's tricky either way, but the way they reacted felt more like someone being honest than someone trying to hide something.

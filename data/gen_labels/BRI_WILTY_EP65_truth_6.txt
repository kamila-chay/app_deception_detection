Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the behavior isn't screaming "liar" or "truth-teller" outright. They're looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—that feels like a good sign, since liars often avoid eye contact, but I know some people just naturally look away while thinking, so it's not definitive. They also have those eyebrows raised a few times, which I've seen people do when they're trying to seem engaged or even a little surprised, but it could just be their normal way of speaking. 

What stands out to me is how calm they seem overall. No fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where they're stuck trying to think of a lie, no forced smiles or nervous blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells—like touching their face or looking around too much—but here, they're mostly still, just shifting their gaze down occasionally while talking. That downcast look sometimes happens when people are being honest and processing what they're saying, but it could also be a sign of discomfort, so I'm not totally sure. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, why would they keep eye contact? Maybe they're trying too hard to seem sincere, but then the down gaze throws me off a bit. I've heard that truth-tellers often have more natural eye movements, and this feels pretty consistent—like they're just having a normal conversation. But I can't rule out that the raised eyebrows might mean they're rehearsing or feeling defensive, which could hint at lying. Still, without any other red flags, it seems more likely they're being honest. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward "truth" just because the lack of nervous energy feels more genuine than the little things that *would* be suspicious if they were lying. But I'm not 100% certain—people are weirdly good at hiding their tells sometimes, and I might be missing something. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context to be sure.

Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because you can't really tell just from one video, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. They're sitting with their palms up—like they're open or trying to show they're not hiding anything—and they're looking directly at whoever they're talking to the whole time. That's usually a good sign for honesty, right? Like, people who are lying sometimes avoid eye contact or look away, but here they're locked in, which feels... genuine? But then there's those raised eyebrows. They keep doing that, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, which makes me pause. Sometimes people do that when they're thinking hard, but I've also heard it can be a sign of deception—like they're trying to "sell" something. 

On the flip side, they're not fidgeting at all. No touching their face, no nervous blinking, no crossing arms or anything. That's actually reassuring. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that physical tension, but here they seem pretty relaxed. Their mouth is closed, but not awkwardly—just calm, like they're just speaking plainly. The palms up gesture especially stands out because it's such a clear "I'm being open" signal. I mean, some people might do that naturally, but paired with the direct eye contact and no other stress signs... it leans toward truth. 

But here's where I'm not 100% sure: maybe the raised eyebrows are just how they talk—like, they always raise them when they're explaining things. And palms up isn't foolproof; some liars use it to seem trustworthy on purpose. Also, the video's short, so I don't know the context. Were they asked a hard question? If it was something easy, their calmness might just mean they're confident, not necessarily truthful. Or maybe they're just used to being straightforward. 

Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think they're probably telling the truth. The lack of classic "lie signs" (like avoiding eyes or fidgeting) and the open gestures feel stronger than the eyebrow thing. But I can't rule out that the eyebrows are a red herring, or that they're just a very calm person. I'd need more to go on, like the actual question they're answering, to be sure. For now, though, it just doesn't *feel* like they're lying—they seem like they're just being themselves. But yeah, I'm not *certain* either. It's one of those cases where the absence of deception cues is the strongest clue, but it's still not absolute.

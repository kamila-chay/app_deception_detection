Watching this video, I'm trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. What stands out to me is how wide they open their mouth when speaking—like they're stretching it out unnaturally, almost like they're trying to emphasize something extra hard. I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes do that to seem more convincing, but I also know people can just talk that way when they're excited or expressive, even when telling the truth. They're also making eye contact most of the time, which usually feels like a good sign for honesty, but they keep looking up and to the side while they talk, and I notice them turning their head sideways a few times. Now, I've read that looking away (like up or sideways) can sometimes signal someone is fabricating a story instead of recalling a memory, which might point to lying. The head turning feels like it could be a sign of discomfort, which might come from lying, but it could also just be them being nervous about the situation—maybe they're in an interview or feel awkward. Honestly, though, the mouth thing really sticks with me. It's so exaggerated that it doesn't seem natural for casual conversation. I'm leaning toward them not being entirely truthful, but I'm not 100% sure because people have all sorts of quirks. Maybe they're just a very animated speaker, or maybe they're genuinely stressed about what they're saying. It's hard to say for sure, but the combination of those cues makes me think deception is possible. Still, I'd hate to jump to conclusions—there are so many ways this could be explained without lying.

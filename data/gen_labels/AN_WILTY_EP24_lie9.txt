Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching the video. So, the person is smiling pretty consistently—lip corners up, not like a full laugh but a steady, maybe a little tight smile—and they're looking right at the camera the whole time, not avoiding eye contact. They also keep glancing up, like they're thinking or recalling something, which I've heard some people say can be a sign of lying because it's where you look when you're constructing a story. But I've also seen people look up naturally when they're trying to remember details, even when they're being honest.  

On the flip side, they don't seem nervous at all. No fidgeting, no blinking a lot, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed like they're struggling for words. In fact, they seem pretty relaxed and engaged—like they're comfortable with what they're saying. That makes me wonder if the smile and the upward gaze are just how they naturally speak, not a mask for lying. I mean, I've known people who smile a lot when they're telling the truth, especially if they're trying to seem friendly or calm.  

But then again, sometimes liars *do* smile to seem relaxed, and the upward gaze might still be a red flag. I guess the thing that's throwing me off is the lack of other "nervous" cues. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe a little more hesitation or a forced smile, but this feels... smooth. Like they've rehearsed it or just genuinely believe what they're saying.  

Honestly, I'm not sure. It's easy to overread things like upward gaze—some people just do that when they think. And the direct eye contact and lack of fidgeting lean toward truth, but I can't rule out that they're just good at hiding it. If I had to guess, I'd lean slightly toward them telling the truth, but I'd want to hear more context or see them in a different situation before being sure. It's just hard to tell from just this clip alone.

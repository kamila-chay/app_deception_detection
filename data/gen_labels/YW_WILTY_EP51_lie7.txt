Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're lying or not, but honestly, it's kind of tricky. They're smiling a little—lip corners up, but not a huge grin or anything, and they're making eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time. That's interesting because I've heard people say liars often avoid eye contact, so that part makes me lean toward them being truthful. But then they keep looking down and sideways a lot, like glancing away from the camera or the other person. I wonder if that's a sign they're uncomfortable or trying to think of what to say next. Sometimes people do that when they're being honest and just thinking, but other times it's a red flag for deception.  

On the flip side, they don't seem stressed at all—no fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no crossed arms or anything. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a bit more tense, right? Like, maybe touching their face or shifting in their seat. But they're just sitting there calm, smiling a bit, and the way they're looking around feels... natural, almost like they're just a little shy or distracted. It doesn't scream "lying" to me.  

But here's where I get stuck: the gaze shifting is weird. If they were telling the truth, why would they look away so much while still making some eye contact? Maybe it's just their normal way of talking—some people don't like staring directly at others. I've seen that a lot in real life, and it's not always about lying. Like, my friend does that all the time when she's explaining something, and she's totally honest.  

So yeah, I'm torn. The smile and lack of stress cues make me think they might be telling the truth, but the way they're looking around keeps me second-guessing. I'd probably say it's ambiguous—maybe they're not lying, but it's hard to tell for sure without more context. Like, if they were answering a question about something personal, the gaze shifts might matter more, but here it feels like they're just being... a bit awkward, not necessarily deceptive. I'd lean toward truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's the kind of thing where you'd need to see more of the conversation to be confident.

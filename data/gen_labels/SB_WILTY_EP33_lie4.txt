Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. There are a few things that make me pause, but honestly, it could just be nerves or them really thinking hard about what to say. They're keeping their mouth closed a lot during pauses—like, they're not smiling or talking smoothly, and it feels a bit stiff. Their lips are actually pushed out a little, which sometimes happens when people are trying to hold back or feel awkward, but I've seen that in people who are just concentrating, not necessarily lying.  

What throws me off is that they're still looking right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels more honest to me—liars often avoid eye contact, but here they're meeting it. Their head is tilted and turned sideways a bit, which seems like they're listening or processing, not like someone trying to hide something. I've seen people do that when they're just thinking through a response, even when they're being truthful.  

On the flip side, the awkward pauses with their mouth shut *could* be a sign they're fabricating something, since liars sometimes hesitate when they're making up details. But then again, I've had conversations where I've paused like that because I was trying to remember something clearly, not because I was lying. The fact that they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact makes me lean away from "lying" a bit—those other cues are pretty common when people are stressed about the topic, not just when they're deceptive.  

Honestly, it's really close. If I had to guess, I'd say it's more likely they're just being careful with their words or nervous about the question, not actively lying. But I wouldn't bet on it—there's no smoking gun here. The video doesn't give me a clear "aha" moment either way. I'd probably ask them to clarify the part they paused on before I'd feel confident. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context to be sure.

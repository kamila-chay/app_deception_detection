Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I have to say I'm leaning towards the possibility that they might be lying, though I can't be entirely sure. There are a few subtle signs that give me pause. For instance, they keep their mouth closed during pauses and don't smile or speak smoothly, which comes off as a bit stiff. Their lips are pushed out slightly, a gesture that can sometimes indicate discomfort or holding something back—although I acknowledge that it can also occur when someone is just concentrating.

What complicates things is their steady eye contact, which usually suggests honesty; liars often avoid looking directly at someone. Their head is tilted and turned sideways, appearing as if they’re listening or processing, which typically isn’t a behavior associated with deception. That seems more natural, like someone carefully considering their words.

However, the awkward silences with their mouth shut might hint at fabrication, since liars often hesitate when crafting a story. While it’s true that people also pause when trying to recall information truthfully, the combination of stiffness, lip movement, and the way they hold their mouth does raise some suspicion. Even though they aren’t fidgeting or avoiding eye contact—which are more overt signs of lying—the subtle cues here make me inclined to doubt their complete truthfulness.

So, while it’s not definitive, and there’s no clear “smoking gun,” I think there’s a reasonable chance they could be withholding or distorting information. I’d need more context or ask for clarification on the moments where they paused before I could be more certain, but right now, I lean toward some level of deception rather than full honesty.

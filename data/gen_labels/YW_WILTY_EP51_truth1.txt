Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, and honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is that they're holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is active, and they're not avoiding it, which usually makes me lean toward truth. Most people who're lying tend to look away or fidget, but here they're locked in, and there's no awkward silence or mouth-closed pauses either. That feels like a good sign.  

Then there's the eyebrow thing—raising eyebrows. It’s not a huge gesture, but it’s there. I’ve heard people say raised eyebrows can signal surprise or skepticism, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they’re genuinely reacting to what’s being said, not trying to cover up something. And their head moving backward? That’s weird—I’d usually associate that with nervousness, but it’s not a classic "lying" tell. Could just be a natural head movement, like leaning back to process a question.  

But here’s where I hesitate: maybe the eyebrow raise is forced? Sometimes people fake surprise when they’re lying to seem engaged. And head movement backward *could* be a subtle avoidance tactic, though it’s not a strong one. I’m also thinking, "Wait, why would they do that if they’re being honest?" But honestly, people get weird with their body language for all sorts of reasons—maybe they’re just tired or the lighting’s bad.  

The other thing that helps me lean truth is that they’re not doing *anything* that screams "lying." No lip biting, no hand rubbing, no fake smiles, no frowning. All those classic "I’m hiding something" cues are absent. If they were lying, I’d expect at least one of those. But absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence, right? Maybe they’re just really good at hiding it, or maybe they’re just not nervous.  

Still, I keep circling back to the eye contact. It’s consistent, not darting or shifty. If they were lying, I’d expect that to crack at some point, but it doesn’t. So yeah, I’m probably leaning toward truth, but I’m not 100% sure. It’s easy to overread body language—people get nervous when telling the truth too, especially if they’re on the spot. I’d say it’s *more likely* truth based on what I’m seeing, but I’d want to hear the actual words before I’d feel confident. Like, "Yeah, that’s probably honest," but I’d still say, "Could be, but I’m not a lie detector."

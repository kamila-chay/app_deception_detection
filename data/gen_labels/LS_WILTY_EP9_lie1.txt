I'm watching this clip now, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. The person is smiling pretty consistently—lip corners up, like they're trying to seem friendly or relaxed—but they keep looking down at the floor instead of making eye contact, which feels a bit off. They're also blinking way more than usual, almost like they're avoiding something or just really nervous. Their head's tilted a little and turned sideways a bit, which sometimes happens when people are thinking hard or trying to seem casual, but it’s not super obvious. I keep wondering if the smile is genuine—maybe they’re just naturally cheerful—but the way they’re avoiding eye contact while smiling, combined with all that blinking, makes me lean toward them not being fully truthful. Like, when people lie, they often try to mask it with a smile but then fidget or look away, and this feels like that.  

But I’m not 100% sure, because it could be something else entirely. Maybe they’re just shy or uncomfortable in general—some people naturally look down when they’re thinking, and the smile might just be their default. The blinking could even be from dry eyes or just how they talk, not nerves. And they’re not doing anything super obvious like covering their mouth or crossing arms, which some people associate with lying. So it’s possible they’re just awkward, not deceptive. I’d say the signs point a bit more toward deception—especially that mix of forced smile and downcast gaze—but it’s not a slam dunk. If I had to guess based on what I’m seeing, I’d lean toward deception, but I’d want to hear more context before I’d be confident. It’s the kind of thing where you’d probably need to see them in a different setting to tell for sure.

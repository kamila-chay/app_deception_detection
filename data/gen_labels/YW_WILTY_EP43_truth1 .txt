Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from watching, but let me walk through what I'm seeing. The person is smiling the whole time—lip corners up, not forced like a fake smile, and they're nodding along while looking right at the person they're talking to. That feels pretty engaged, which usually lines up with someone being truthful, not hiding something. They also have their palms up, which I've heard people say can signal openness, like they're not hiding anything. And they're tilting their head a little, which seems natural, not like they're trying to seem innocent. 

But yeah, the frequent blinking is making me pause a little. I know some people say liars blink more, but honestly, I've seen lots of people blink a lot when they're just nervous or concentrating, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're just really focused on what they're saying, or maybe they have dry eyes. And that chin moving up? I'm not sure what to make of that—it's not a classic sign I've heard about, so I'm not sure if it's relevant. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, I'd expect them to avoid eye contact more, or maybe fidget with their hands, or cross their arms like they're shutting down. But here, they're not doing any of that—hands are still, arms aren't crossed, and they're actually leaning in a bit with that head tilt. The gaze is up too, which some people say means they're thinking, but since they're not avoiding the other person's eyes, it doesn't feel like they're making it up. 

I guess the thing that sticks with me is how relaxed the smile and nod feel. It's not stiff or exaggerated—they're matching the conversation. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in the face or voice, but the video doesn't show that. Still, I can't rule out that the blinking might be a stress sign. Like, maybe they're just really nervous about the topic, not necessarily lying. 

Honestly, after watching it a couple times, it leans toward truthful for me. The cues that usually signal deception aren't there, and the ones that suggest openness are. But I'm not 100% sure—I mean, people can lie while still smiling and nodding if they're practiced. It's just... the way they're engaging feels too natural to be a performance. I'd say it's probably truth, but yeah, it's not impossible to misread. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward truthful, but I'd want to hear the actual words to be sure.

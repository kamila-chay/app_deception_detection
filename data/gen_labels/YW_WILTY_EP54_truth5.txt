Watching the clip, I'm trying to piece together whether this person seems truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't super obvious. What stands out is they don't have any of those classic "nervous" tells—no fidgeting with their hands, no avoiding eye contact (wait, actually, they're not looking directly at the camera, but they're not darting their eyes around either), and no weird facial expressions like frowning or forced smiles. The fact that their palms are up and open feels like it might lean toward honesty, since that gesture often signals openness or sincerity in a lot of contexts. Plus, they're not blinking a lot or seeming tense, which usually makes me think they're not stressed about what they're saying.  

But then I keep circling back to the raised eyebrows—they're definitely lifted, which could mean surprise or skepticism, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're genuinely processing the question, or maybe they're just a person who raises their brows a lot when thinking. And that lack of eye contact... I know some people avoid it naturally, but it's also something liars sometimes do. I'm not sure if it's relevant here though, since they're not shifting around or looking away aggressively.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more signs—like lip biting or nervous gestures—but there's none of that. The absence of those red flags feels heavier to me than the raised eyebrows. Like, if they were trying to hide something, they'd probably seem more on edge. This just feels... calm? Even if they're not making direct eye contact, they're not acting like they're hiding anything.  

I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It's not a slam dunk, though—maybe they're just really good at staying calm when they're lying. But based on what I'm seeing, the lack of stress indicators seems to outweigh the eyebrow thing. It's hard to say for sure without more context, but my gut says it's truth.

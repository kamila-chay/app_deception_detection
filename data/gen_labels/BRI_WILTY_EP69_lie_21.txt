Looking at the clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'll try to break it down. The person seems to be responding to something, and their eyes are doing a few things that stand out. They're raising their eyebrows a couple of times—like, not just a little, but pretty noticeably. And their gaze keeps flicking sideways, not directly at whoever's talking to them. That makes me think they might be uncomfortable or trying to avoid engagement, which sometimes happens when people are being careful with their words. The palms-up gesture they have going on feels a bit odd though; I usually associate that with openness or trying to seem sincere, like "I'm telling you the truth." That part actually works against the "lying" idea for me.

But then again, maybe they're just nervous about the situation, not necessarily lying. Raising eyebrows can be a natural reaction to something surprising or unexpected, not just deception. And the sideways glance? Could be they're just thinking about what to say, or maybe they're distracted by something else in the room—not necessarily hiding something. I've seen people do that when they're genuinely trying to remember details, not when they're lying. The fact that they don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely (just glancing sideways) also makes it feel less like a classic "liar" behavior. Like, if they were really making it up, I'd expect more signs of stress—like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely—but here it's just a little sideways look and those eyebrows.

Honestly, it's really hard to tell. The palms-up thing is throwing me off because it usually signals honesty, but maybe they're trying to fake that to seem trustworthy. Or maybe it's just how they naturally gesture. I don't see any clear signs of deception like forced smiles or nervous blinking, which are more common red flags. But the eyebrow raises and sideways glance... those are the things that stick with me. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward them possibly not being entirely truthful, but I'm not confident at all. It could easily be them just being a little awkward or thoughtful. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation to feel better about it. For now, I'm split—maybe a little "not sure," but the behavior leans slightly toward deception, just barely.

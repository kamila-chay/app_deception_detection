Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit tricky to call either way. The person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually leans toward truth-telling since liars often avoid direct gaze. But then there's that slight frown and raised eyebrows together, which makes me pause. I've heard people say frowning can signal discomfort or lying, but honestly, I've also seen people frown when they're just concentrating hard on remembering something or trying to be careful with their words. The fact that their lip corners are slightly up (like a quiet, soft smile) feels genuine too—not forced or exaggerated, which might rule out some deliberate deception. They're nodding along naturally, and the head side-turning seems like a casual gesture, not something nervous like shaking their head.  

But here's where I get unsure: they keep looking down and sideways a lot, which people sometimes do when they're lying—like they're avoiding the weight of the conversation. But then again, I've also seen people look away when they're just thinking, even when they're being honest. Like, if they're recalling a detail, they might glance down to visualize it. And the raised eyebrows? That could mean they're surprised by the question or just processing it, not necessarily lying. Honestly, the lack of obvious "lie signs" like excessive blinking, lip biting, or avoiding eye contact makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I can't shake that frown. Maybe they're just stressed about the topic, not the truth of what they're saying.  

I mean, I'd want more context—like, are they talking about something emotional? If it's a sad memory, the frown makes sense without any deception. Without that, it's hard to say. My gut says they're probably telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to bet on it. It feels like one of those moments where the behavior is just... normal human hesitation, not a red flag. But yeah, I'm not 100% sure—I'd need to see more of the conversation to feel confident.

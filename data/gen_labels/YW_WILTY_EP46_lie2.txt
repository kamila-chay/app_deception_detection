While it's difficult to be certain based solely on the video, there are several subtle cues that make me lean toward the possibility that the person might be deceptive. Their frequent eyebrow raises could be interpreted as genuine surprise or skepticism, but in some cases, such gestures are used when someone is carefully choosing their words. Additionally, the slight chin lifts and the forward and backward bobbing of the head might suggest an attempt to appear more engaged or may stem from nervousness, which can be associated with deception. 

Although they maintain steady eye contact, which typically signals honesty, some individuals intentionally hold eye contact to seem trustworthy when they’re not. The lack of smiling or laughter and the relatively stiff mouth movements might be a sign of overcontrolled expressions, something people sometimes do when they’re hiding something. It's also possible that the person is simply uncomfortable, which can produce similar behaviors without actual lying.

Their head movements seem thoughtful rather than fidgety or avoidance-driven, and they do lean in, possibly trying to connect, which somewhat counters the idea of deception. Still, deception can be subtle and difficult to detect, especially without knowing the context or what is being said. Overall, while I can’t say for sure, I find myself cautiously leaning toward the idea that they may not be entirely truthful.

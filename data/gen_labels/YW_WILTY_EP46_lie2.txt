Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying here—it's really hard to tell from just the video alone. What stands out to me is how they're raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're genuinely surprised or skeptical about something, which can sometimes happen when people are being careful with their words. But then their chin is moving up and down a bit, almost like a little chin lift, and their head's kind of bobbing forward and back while they're talking. That makes me wonder if they're trying to seem more engaged or maybe just nervous about the topic. They're also keeping steady eye contact with whoever's asking, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—liars often avoid that—but I've heard some people fake it to seem trustworthy. 

On the flip side, the fact that they're not smiling or laughing, and their mouth isn't moving much (like no awkward pauses), could feel a bit stiff. Sometimes when people are lying, they get overly controlled with their expressions, but it could also just be how they naturally talk when they're focused. I keep thinking, "Maybe they're just uncomfortable with the question," not necessarily lying. Like, if I were asked something I didn't want to answer, I might tense up and raise my eyebrows without meaning to. 

The head movements especially—I don't think they're doing it to signal deception; it just looks like they're thinking hard, maybe even trying to emphasize points. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but here they're actually leaning in a bit, which feels like they're trying to connect. Still, I can't rule it out entirely—deception can look subtle, and without knowing what they're talking about, it's tough. Honestly, I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not confident at all. It's just that the cues don't scream "lie" to me like some other videos I've seen where people are clearly avoiding eye contact or overdoing smiles. This feels more like someone who's just... being themselves, maybe a little uneasy. But yeah, I'd need more context to be sure.

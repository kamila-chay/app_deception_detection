Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm actually a bit torn on whether this person is lying or not. Let me walk through what stands out to me. They're definitely making eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that "gaze towards interlocutor" detail jumps out, and it's consistent throughout. That feels like a strong sign they're being honest, because I've noticed when people lie, they often avoid direct eye contact or glance away more frequently. But here, they're holding it, and they even have this slight upward curve at the corners of their mouth—like a gentle, polite smile—not a big fake grin, but not a frown either. And their arms are open, which usually reads as relaxed and approachable, not defensive. That kind of body language often aligns with truth-telling, where people aren't trying to hide or create barriers.

But then I keep wondering: maybe that smile is actually a red herring. Sometimes people force a smile when they're nervous or lying, trying to seem friendly to cover up. And the sideways glance they have now and then—like when they're thinking or answering—could be a sign of discomfort, right? I've seen that in other videos where someone's trying to recall something, whether they're lying or not. It's not a huge thing, but it's there. Also, the fact that they're not doing the usual "liar tells"—like fidgeting, blinking a lot, or avoiding eye contact—makes me lean toward truth, but it's not impossible that they're just really good at hiding it. Some people can stay calm under pressure and not show the classic signs.

Honestly, the most convincing thing for me is the combination of the direct eye contact and the open arms. It feels genuine, like they're trying to connect, not shut down. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like crossing arms or looking away more. But I'm not 100% sure—maybe they're just a very composed person. I'd say I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. There's enough ambiguity that it could go either way, especially since people's baseline behavior varies so much. If I had to guess without any other context, I'd probably say truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to be certain.

Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video, but I'll try to break it down like I'm watching it unfold. So, the person is smiling, which usually feels like a good sign for truthfulness, right? But then their eyebrows are scrunched in a frown and their lips are pulled down at the corners—that's a bit confusing. Like, they're trying to smile but their face is showing stress or discomfort. They're also blinking a lot, which I've heard can be a sign of nervousness, maybe from being filmed or just the situation being tense. 

On the other hand, they're looking directly at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), and they're nodding along while tilting their head sideways a bit—those feel like natural, engaged gestures. Liars often avoid eye contact or have stiff movements, but here they seem to be leaning in and following the conversation. The sideways gaze might just mean they're thinking or processing, not necessarily lying. And the fact that they're not avoiding the camera or fidgeting with their hands (no rubbing or scratching) also seems less like deception. 

But wait—could the smile be fake? Sometimes people force a smile when they're lying to seem friendly, and the frowning eyebrows and downturned lips might be their real feelings slipping through. The frequent blinking could be from that stress. Still, the consistent eye contact and head tilting make me wonder if they're just genuinely anxious about whatever they're talking about, not lying. Like, maybe they're nervous about the topic, not the story itself. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The mixed signals (smiling vs. frowning) are throwing me off, but the way they're engaging with the other person feels more like someone being honest but rattled, not someone spinning a tale. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance or unnatural gestures, but this seems... human. Like they're trying to be calm but aren't. I'd lean toward truth, but I'm not 100%—it could easily be the other way. Nerves can look like lies, and truth can look nervous. Gotta go with the gut here: the engagement feels real.

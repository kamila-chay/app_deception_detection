Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky. At first glance, the sideways glance and raised eyebrows make me pause because sometimes people look away or raise their brows when they're not being straight with you. Like, if they're trying to think of a story or avoid eye contact, that's a common thing people do when lying. But then I notice they're not doing any of the other classic "tells" you'd expect—no frowning, no lip biting, no weird blinking or nervous hands. Actually, their arms are wide open, which usually feels like someone being genuine or trying to seem open, not deceptive. 

I keep wondering if the sideways gaze is just them thinking or maybe distracted by something off-screen, not necessarily lying. Like, if I'm recalling a detail in my head, I might glance away naturally. And the raised eyebrows? Could just be surprise at the question, not guilt. But then again, if they were lying, why wouldn't they at least try to look more "normal" with eye contact? The fact that they're not fidgeting or covering their mouth makes me lean away from "lying," but I'm not totally convinced. Honestly, it's hard to say without more context—maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're actually being truthful and the sideways look is just how they process things. I'd probably say they seem honest, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. There's just not enough clear "lie" behavior here to be sure.

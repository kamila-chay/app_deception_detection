This is a bit tricky. Watching the clip, the person is nodding a few times while speaking, which can seem natural and like they’re agreeing or just keeping the conversation going. They maintain eye contact with the other person most of the time, which is often a positive sign, but they also glance sideways fairly often—not directly at the other person or the camera. That sideways glance can sometimes indicate distraction or thinking, but it’s also a behavior people sometimes show when they’re not being fully truthful.

Their raised eyebrows stand out—this could suggest surprise or skepticism about what they’re saying, but it might also be a nervous habit. The slight upward pull at the corners of their lips looks like a tentative smile, almost like they’re trying to appear friendly or calm, which might hint at them putting on a front. While these signs can be quite subtle and common in polite conversation, combined with the sideways glances and raised brows, they start to look a bit suspicious.

Interestingly, the person doesn’t show classic signs of lying like fidgeting, covering the mouth, or avoiding eye contact completely. They aren’t showing clear stress signals either, like scowling or frowning. This makes it less obvious. Still, the mixture of sideways glances, raised eyebrows, and the slight forced smile could be subtle cues of nervousness or discomfort that sometimes accompany deception.

It’s possible they’re just naturally expressive or uncomfortable rather than outright lying, and the sideways gaze might be caused by something like looking at a note. However, considering the combination of these signals, I lean more towards the idea that they might be less than truthful here. It’s not certain, but the behavior nudges me in that direction more than the opposite.

Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is how they keep looking down instead of making eye contact—like, their gaze is consistently down, not on whoever they're talking to. That feels a bit off, especially in a conversation where you'd expect some natural eye contact. And their head keeps moving backward a little, like they're pulling away, and they're also turning their head sideways a few times. It’s not super dramatic, but it seems like they're avoiding engagement, which sometimes happens when people are uncomfortable or hiding something. The chin moving up a bit too—like they're trying to hold their head steady while they talk—makes me wonder if they're overcompensating.

But here's where I start hesitating. I've seen people do these things without lying all the time. Maybe they're just tired, or maybe they're from a culture where direct eye contact feels rude. Or maybe they're just naturally fidgety—some folks look down when they're thinking hard, not because they're lying. The clip doesn't show any obvious signs like nervous laughter, exaggerated gestures, or avoiding eye contact *completely*, which sometimes makes me think it might not be deception. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more of a "tell," but it's subtle. 

On the flip side, the combination of looking down, head moving back, and that sideways tilt... it does feel a bit like they're trying to create distance, which isn't typical for someone relaxed. But I can't rule out that it's just their normal way of talking. I mean, I've had conversations where I spaced out and looked down without lying about anything. Without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's really hard to say. 

Honestly, I'd lean slightly toward maybe deception just because of the avoidance cues, but I'm not at all sure. It's the kind of thing where if I saw it in real life, I'd probably just shrug and say, "Huh, that feels a bit off, but I don't know for sure." Maybe they're just bad at eye contact, or maybe they're stressed about something unrelated. I'd need more to go on before I'd feel confident either way.

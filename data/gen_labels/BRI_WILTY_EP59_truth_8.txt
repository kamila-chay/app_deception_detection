Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's kind of tricky. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to (which usually feels more honest, right?), and they're raising their eyebrows a few times, like they're genuinely surprised or processing something. But they also keep glancing down occasionally, which sometimes makes me think they're trying to recall details, which could go either way—truthful people do that when they're thinking hard, but liars might look down to avoid eye contact while fabricating something.  

What stands out to me is how calm they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no weird smiles or nervous blinking, no crossing arms or covering their mouth—those are the classic "lying signs" I've heard about, and they're totally absent here. If they were making it up, I'd expect some of that tension, but they just seem... focused. Like they're carefully choosing their words, but not like they're hiding something.  

That said, I shouldn't rule out lying just because they're calm. Some people are really good at lying without showing stress—maybe they're practiced or just not anxious about it. And the eyebrow-raising could even be a bit of a tell for deception, like they're trying to seem innocent, but it's so subtle. Honestly, I'm torn. On one hand, the lack of nervous gestures leans toward truth. On the other, the downcast gaze *could* be a way to avoid detection. But I guess if I had to guess, I'd lean toward them telling the truth because the absence of those obvious "lie cues" feels more consistent with someone being genuine. Still, I wouldn't bet my life on it—people are complicated, and this video doesn't give me the whole story.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from watching, but here's how I'm thinking about it. So, the person in the video seems pretty steady—like, they're looking directly at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which feels like they're engaged, not avoiding eye contact. That's usually a sign of honesty, right? But then their mouth is doing this weird thing—lip corners both up and down at the same time? Like, half-smiling but also kind of frowning? It's not a full smile, and it's not a scowl, so it's hard to read. Maybe they're just reacting to what they're saying, or maybe it's a little nervous tic, but it doesn't scream "lying" to me.  

Then there's the chin thing—they keep moving it up a little, like a tiny lift, and their eyes are down a lot, not darting around. I've heard people say gaze down can mean someone's thinking or being sincere, not hiding something. And no fidgeting—no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed like they're searching for words. That actually feels more like they're comfortable with what they're saying, which leans toward truth. But wait—could it be the opposite? Like, maybe they're *too* calm, or the chin movement is a fake sign of confidence? Or maybe the mixed lip thing is a micro-expression of discomfort they're trying to hide? I mean, some people lie really smoothly, so the lack of obvious tells might not mean anything.  

Honestly, I'm not totally sure. The absence of classic "lie" cues (like looking away, fidgeting, or forced smiles) makes me lean toward truth, but that mixed lip thing throws me off a little. It’s not *definitely* a sign of lying, but it’s not clear either. If I had to guess based on what I’m seeing, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth, but I’d want to hear the actual words they’re saying to be sure. Like, sometimes the context matters way more than the face. It’s just hard to tell from just the video alone.

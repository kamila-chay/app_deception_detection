Honestly, while it's difficult to be certain just from watching this, the person's gaze—looking up and sideways rather than directly at the listener—does raise some suspicion. Since I've heard that liars often avoid eye contact, this behavior might suggest they're hiding something. Although it’s true that people sometimes look away or up when thinking or trying to recall information, the fact that the gaze is so noticeably diverted could lean more towards discomfort or deception. The lack of other typical signs of lying, like fidgeting or nervous gestures, makes the situation less clear-cut, but it also doesn’t rule out the possibility that they’re being untruthful. Given these mixed signals, I suspect there’s a reasonable chance the person might not be telling the truth, even if it's not completely certain.

Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from watching this. The person's gaze is definitely up and sideways—they're not looking directly at whoever they're talking to, which might make some people think they're hiding something. I've heard people say liars often avoid eye contact, so that part could raise a red flag. But then again, I've noticed in real life that people look away or up all the time when they're just thinking, even when they're being completely honest—like when they're trying to remember a detail or organize their thoughts. There's no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or nervous gestures that I'd usually associate with lying. In fact, the absence of those classic "lie signs" feels a bit confusing. Maybe they're just naturally a little distracted or thoughtful, not necessarily deceptive. I mean, I could totally see someone thinking "they're lying" because of the gaze, but I also think it's just as likely they're just processing what they're saying. Honestly, without more context, I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not at all certain—this feels like one of those cases where the behavior is ambiguous enough that it could go either way.

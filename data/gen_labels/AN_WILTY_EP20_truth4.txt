Looking at the clip, I'm trying to piece this together, but honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous blinking. They’re actually making steady eye contact with whoever they’re talking to, which is a bit unusual if they were lying, since many people tend to look away when they’re not being truthful. They also don’t have that "awkward pause" thing where the mouth stays closed or lips are pulled down, which sometimes happens when someone’s scrambling for words. Instead, they’re nodding their head a bit (wait, no—actually, the head shaking is listed as happening, but it’s not clear if it’s "yes" or "no" in context). That head shaking is throwing me off a little; sometimes people do that reflexively, but if they were denying something, it might feel like a red flag. Still, the fact that they’re not doing anything else—like covering their mouth, scratching, or looking down too much—makes me lean toward them being honest. Like, if they were lying, I’d expect at least a hint of tension, but they seem relaxed.  

On the flip side, though, I know head shaking can be ambiguous. Maybe they’re shaking their head in disagreement about something unrelated, and that’s just part of the conversation. Or maybe they’re just a naturally expressive person who shakes their head a lot, even when telling the truth. And yeah, I’ve heard that some liars try to *appear* calm on purpose, so the lack of nervous gestures doesn’t *prove* they’re truthful—it just doesn’t scream "lying." It’s hard to tell without hearing the actual words, but based on what I see, the behavior doesn’t feel like the classic "deception signs" I’ve read about. I’m not 100% confident, but if I had to guess, I’d say they’re probably telling the truth. It’s not a slam dunk, though—I’d want to hear the context to be sure. Like, maybe the head shaking is a "no" to a question they’re answering truthfully, so it’s not even a lie. Ugh, I’m overthinking it. But yeah, based on the video alone, I’d lean toward truth.

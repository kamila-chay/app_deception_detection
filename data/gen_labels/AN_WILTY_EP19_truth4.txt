Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while speaking. They're consistently looking directly at whoever they're talking to—like they're actively listening or sharing something important—and their gaze is actually up, not down or away. That upward gaze often shows someone is recalling something from memory, which usually happens when people are being truthful, not making things up. I also don't see any of the usual nervous tells: no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where they're holding their mouth shut, no raised eyebrows or frowns that might signal discomfort. They're just speaking normally, like they're comfortable with what they're saying.  

That said, I know some really skilled liars can stay calm and even make eye contact without seeming stressed. Maybe they're just practiced at this, or maybe they're not even lying about something that's familiar to them. It's also possible the situation isn't high-stakes—like if they're just describing a routine event, they wouldn't have to act out of character. The lack of nervous gestures *does* lean toward truth, but it's not absolute. I guess if I had to guess, I'd say it seems unlikely they're lying, but I wouldn't bet money on it. There are always exceptions, and without knowing the context, it's hard to be 100% sure. Honestly, the most telling thing is how natural they seem—like they're just sharing a story, not trying to convince someone of something they're making up. But yeah, I'd say truth feels more probable based on what I'm watching.

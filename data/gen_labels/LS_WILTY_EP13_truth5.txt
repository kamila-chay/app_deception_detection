Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. Let me think through what I'm seeing. The person seems pretty animated in their head and facial movements—raised eyebrows, frequent blinking, and that slight chin lift with lips pushed out. Those definitely read as nervous or tense to me at first glance, which makes me wonder if they're hiding something. The sideways glance and head tilting sideways feel a bit like they're trying to avoid direct engagement, and the head moving backward a little could suggest discomfort or defensiveness. If I were just watching this without any context, I might lean toward "they're not being fully honest" because those cues often show up when people are stressed about lying.

But then I keep second-guessing myself. They're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—gaze toward interlocutor is true—and they're nodding while speaking, which usually feels like genuine engagement, not someone rehearsing a lie. The lip corners down and protruded lips don't look like a fake smile either; they seem more like they're just thinking hard or annoyed by the question, not trying to mask deception. And the frequent blinking? Could just be dry eyes or general anxiety about being on camera, not necessarily guilt. I've seen people get super jittery in interviews even when they're telling the truth—maybe they're just really nervous about the topic, not the answer itself. 

Also, the lack of classic "lie signs" stands out. No avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses with mouth closed, no hands covering the face. If they were actively lying, I'd expect more of those. The head tilting sideways might even be a natural gesture for someone trying to recall details, which happens when people are truthful. Honestly, it feels like they're just really stressed about whatever they're discussing, and the tension might be making me *think* they're lying when they're not. I'm not 100% sure, but the way they're maintaining eye contact while fidgeting makes me lean toward "truth" more than "lie"—it’s the nervousness of someone who’s being honest but uncomfortable, not someone who's trying to deceive. Still, it’s hard to say for sure without knowing the context. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person!

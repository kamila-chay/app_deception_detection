Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up for me. On one hand, they seem really tense—like, they're raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking way more than usual, which I've heard can signal stress or even deception. When people are lying, they often fidget or show nervous signs like that, right? And they do glance sideways a couple of times, which might mean they're avoiding eye contact to hide something. I've seen that before in other videos where someone's trying to keep their story straight but it's not adding up.

But then again, they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like the opposite of lying. If they were making it up, I'd expect them to look away more, not keep engaging like that. Maybe the sideways glances are just them thinking or shifting their focus naturally, not because they're hiding anything. And the frequent blinking? Could easily be from the camera lights being bright or just them being nervous about being recorded, not necessarily lying. I mean, I get nervous too when I'm being filmed, even when I'm telling the truth.

So yeah, I'm really not sure. The signs point both ways—nervous ticks could mean deception, but the eye contact leans toward honesty. It's hard to say without knowing the context, like what they're even talking about. Maybe they're just a naturally anxious person, or maybe they're lying. I'd lean toward them telling the truth because of the consistent eye contact, but I wouldn't bet on it. Honestly, I think it's one of those cases where you'd need more to go on, like their tone or the actual content of what they're saying, to be sure.

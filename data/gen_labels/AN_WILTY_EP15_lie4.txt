Looking at this clip, I'm not totally sure if they're lying or not—it's really tricky to tell just from body language alone. The person keeps looking down a lot, which stands out since they're not making eye contact with whoever's talking to them. That kind of downward gaze can sometimes happen when someone's nervous or trying to avoid being caught in a lie, but it could also just mean they're shy, distracted, or even just thinking hard about their answer. I've seen people look down for all sorts of reasons—maybe they're uncomfortable with the camera, or they're trying to remember something without seeming like they're faking it.  

Then there's the bit where they keep touching their head or face—like adjusting their hair or rubbing their neck a few times. That *could* be a nervous habit, which people often do when they're stressed or lying, but honestly, I do that myself when I'm just bored or trying to focus. It's not a dead giveaway. Like, maybe they have an itch, or they're just used to fiddling with their hair when they're in a conversation.  

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the classic "lie signs" people usually point to—no fake smiles, no weird blinking, no avoiding eye contact completely (they're just looking down, not away entirely). If they were trying to hide something, I'd expect more obvious signs, like fidgeting with their hands or shifting in their seat, but they're pretty still otherwise. That makes me wonder if the downward gaze is just a personality thing—maybe they're naturally quiet or introverted.  

Honestly, though, I'm not confident. The behavior isn't screaming "liar," but it's not screaming "truth" either. Without knowing what they're being asked about or the context of the conversation, it's hard to say. If it was a simple question and they're avoiding eye contact like that, I might lean toward "maybe," but if it's a complicated topic, it could just be them processing. I'd need to see more of the clip or hear the actual question to feel any more sure about it. For now, I'd say it's ambiguous—could be nervousness, could be something else entirely.

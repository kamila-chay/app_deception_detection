Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the video, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I'd hesitate to call it 100% certain. What stands out is how natural their movements feel: they're keeping steady eye contact with the person they're talking to (gaze toward interlocutor is true), their arms are open—no crossing or blocking, which usually signals openness—and their chin moves up slightly when they're speaking, like they're trying to emphasize something without seeming defensive. The head moving forward and a slight side-turn feel like typical conversational gestures, not the stiff, rehearsed stuff I've seen when people are hiding something. Plus, there's zero fidgeting—no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses with their mouth closed, nothing that screams "nervous liar."  

But I can see why someone might doubt it. That gaze down happening sometimes—like when they're thinking or hesitating—could raise a red flag for some people. I've heard that liars often avoid eye contact, so seeing them look down might make you think they're hiding something. But honestly? In this clip, they're still mostly looking at the person they're talking to, so the down-gaze feels more like someone processing what they're saying, not avoiding it. And truth-tellers do look down while thinking—they're not constantly staring like they're memorizing a script.  

The other thing is the absence of "tells": no exaggerated expressions, no fake smiles, no lip biting. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those nervous ticks, especially if they're trying hard to seem convincing. The fact that their body language feels relaxed and engaged—arms open, head forward—makes me think they're just being genuine. Like, if they were faking it, they'd probably overdo the "I'm honest" stuff, but here it's all subtle. Still, I know people can be really good at faking calmness, so I'm not ruling out the possibility entirely. But based on what I see, the evidence points more toward truth than deception. It just feels... effortless. Like they're not trying to convince anyone of anything.

Honestly, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but it's really tricky. What stands out most is how often they're blinking—like, a lot more than usual while answering the question. I've heard that frequent blinking can sometimes be a sign of stress or nervousness, which people associate with lying, so that makes me wonder. But then I'm also noticing they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact, not fidgeting, not shifting in their seat, and their facial expressions are pretty neutral—no frowns or forced smiles. That makes me think maybe it's not about deception.  

On the other hand, if they *were* lying, the blinking could just be their natural reaction to being put on the spot, especially if they're trying to control their other cues. Like, maybe they're so focused on keeping their face calm that their eyes just start blinking more. I've seen people do that when they're nervous about something unrelated to lying too—maybe they're just tired, or the lighting is weird, or they have an eye irritation. And honestly, the way they're speaking seems steady, no awkward pauses or stammering, which I'd expect if they were making something up.  

But then again, some people lie really smoothly without obvious tells, so the blinking might be a subtle clue. I'm not sure though—because if they *were* telling the truth, the blinking could just be a coincidence. Like, maybe they're thinking hard about the question, or it's just how they talk. I feel like I'm overthinking it because there's not much else going on in the clip. The lack of other "deception signs" (like avoiding gaze or fidgeting) actually makes me lean a bit toward them being honest, but I can't rule out the blinking entirely. It's just not enough to be certain.  

Honestly, I'd say it's ambiguous. The blinking is noticeable, but without more context—like the question they're answering or their usual behavior—it's hard to tell if it's a red flag or just a habit. I wouldn't bet on it being deception, but I also wouldn't say for sure they're telling the truth. It feels like one of those moments where you just have to shrug and say, "I don't know."

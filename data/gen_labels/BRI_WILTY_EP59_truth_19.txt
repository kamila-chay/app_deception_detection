Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece this together, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely, which makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. They have those raised eyebrows and a slight frown, which I might initially think means they're hiding something, but I've read that people often do that when they're concentrating or even just processing what they're saying, not necessarily lying. Like, if someone's trying to remember a detail, they might scrunch their eyebrows up, and that's totally normal.  

What stands out to me is how they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time—gaze towards interlocutor is true—plus they're tilting their head a bit, which feels like curiosity or engagement, not deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous ticks, like avoiding eye contact entirely or playing with their hands, but they're not doing any of that. The lip corners up thing is interesting—they're not smiling broadly, but there's a tiny hint of a smile, which might just be natural when they're speaking sincerely.  

On the flip side, the gaze down and sideways makes me pause a little. Some people think looking away means they're lying, but I've heard that's not always true—sometimes people look down when they're thinking hard, which happens even when telling the truth. And the frowning eyebrows could easily be misread as discomfort from the topic, not guilt. I mean, if I was explaining something awkward, I might frown too, even if I'm being honest.  

Honestly, I don't think the cues here are strong enough to call it a lie. The absence of classic "lying" signs (like shaky hands or forced smiles) weighs more heavily for me than the few ambiguous ones. But I'm not ruling out the possibility that they're being evasive—maybe they're just not great at expressing themselves. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd want to hear more context before I'd feel confident about it. It's not like there's a smoking gun here, just a few small things that don't quite add up to deception.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're not showing any of the obvious "tells" people usually associate with lying—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that nervous smile. In fact, they're not doing much with their face at all: no scowling, no exaggerated expressions, no lip movements that seem off. The only thing that stands out is how they're moving their eyes—sometimes looking up, sometimes down, but not at the person they're talking to. 

Now, I know some people say that when people lie, they look up to "make things up," but I've also heard that truth-telling can involve looking up when recalling memories. Like, if they're trying to remember something real, their eyes might drift upward. And since they're also looking down at times, it might just be them thinking naturally, not trying to cover anything up. The fact that they're not blinking a lot or shifting in their seat actually makes me lean toward them being honest—lying usually makes people more restless, right? But then again, some people are really good at staying calm when they're lying, so that absence of nervousness could just mean they're practiced. 

I also keep wondering about the lack of eye contact. If they were lying, you might expect them to avoid looking at the person they're talking to, but they're not doing that either—it's just that their gaze is shifting away entirely, not necessarily avoiding. Maybe they're just concentrating on what they're saying, or maybe they're tired. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure because people act differently. The video doesn't show them hesitating or having awkward pauses either, which sometimes happens when someone's making things up, but truth-tellers can be smooth too. 

So yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing—no obvious stress cues, just neutral behavior while their eyes move around—I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it, because you can't really rule out that they're just a really cool-headed liar. It feels like it could go either way, but the lack of red flags makes it seem more likely they're being genuine. Still, I'd want to see more context to be sure.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's actually kind of tricky. They're keeping their arms wide open the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of openness or honesty, not something someone would do if they were hiding something. And they're staring straight at the person they're talking to the whole time, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars often avoid eye contact. But then they keep shaking their head—like, a slow, deliberate "no" motion while they're speaking. That part makes me pause because head shaking can sometimes signal disagreement or even denial, which *could* hint at deception.  

But here's where it gets confusing: they're not doing any of the classic "lying" tells—no fidgeting, no nervous blinking, no fake smiles or lip biting. Their face looks pretty neutral, just focused. I wonder if the head shaking is just a habit they have, like how some people nod when they're thinking, but it's actually a "no" motion. Maybe they're shaking their head to emphasize that they *are* telling the truth, like "No, I'm not lying," but that feels a bit off. Or maybe they're genuinely disagreeing with something else in the conversation, not denying the truth.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, why would they keep their arms open and hold eye contact so steadily? Most of the time, when people are deceptive, they close off their body language—crossing arms, looking away. The fact that they're not doing that makes me lean toward them being honest, even with the head shake. But I can't rule out the head shake entirely—it might just be a nervous tic unrelated to lying. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're actually saying. If they're denying something they *did* do, the head shake might fit, but if they're just confirming something, it could be normal. I'd probably need to hear the words to feel more confident. Right now, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because of the open posture and eye contact, but I wouldn't bet on it—nonverbal cues are so messy.

Okay, so I just watched this clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn. The person seems pretty calm while answering whatever they're being asked. They're definitely looking right at the person talking to them the whole time—no dodging eyes, which I usually associate with lying. And their hands are open, palms up, like they're being transparent. That's the kind of thing people say shows honesty, right? Like, if they were hiding something, you'd expect them to cross their arms or have their hands tucked away. But here, it's just... open. 

At first glance, that makes me lean toward them telling the truth. You know, the "no fidgeting, steady eye contact, palms up" vibe usually feels like someone who's not hiding anything. I mean, I've seen so many "lie detectors" on TV where people get all jittery, but this person's completely still. No blinking like crazy, no awkward pauses where they stop talking—just a smooth flow. 

But then... I keep thinking, "Wait, maybe they're *too* calm?" Like, what if they're really good at controlling themselves? I've heard that some people who lie *on purpose* can suppress those nervous tells, especially if they're practiced. So the fact that they're not showing *any* of the classic "lie" signs might actually be suspicious. Like, if they were nervous, I'd expect *some* sign—maybe a slight shift in posture or a forced smile—but there's nothing. It's almost... too composed. 

And honestly, the open palms are tricky. I know some people do that naturally, but I've also seen it used as a subtle "I'm not hiding anything" gesture. But then again, it could just be how they naturally gesture. Like, maybe they're just a calm person, period. 

So yeah... I'm stuck. On one hand, the behavior screams "truthful" based on what I've read about body language. On the other, the *absence* of any tension or nervousness feels... off for a lie. But I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it. I'd probably ask them to repeat the part about [whatever the topic was] to see if they stay consistent, but just from the clip? I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. There's just too much room for them to be a really good actor. It's hard to say for sure.

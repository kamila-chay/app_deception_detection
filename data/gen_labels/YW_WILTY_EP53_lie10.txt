After watching the clip, I have to admit I'm leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely clear-cut. They remain very calm throughout, maintaining steady eye contact and using open palms, which are typically signs of honesty. However, that very calmness seems almost rehearsed—too controlled, without any of the subtle nervous tells you'd expect if someone were genuinely truthful under pressure. The absence of any visible tension, fidgeting, or hesitation feels a bit suspicious, as if they're intentionally suppressing any signs that might give them away. 

While open palms usually signal transparency, they could also be a deliberate gesture to appear honest. Given how composed they are with no micro-expressions or posture shifts, it makes me wonder if this calmness is a practiced performance rather than a natural state. Although it could simply be a calm personality, the total lack of nervous behavior is unusual enough to raise some doubts. So overall, I’m inclined to think they might be concealing something, even if the evidence isn’t definitive. There’s enough here to question their sincerity more than to fully trust it.

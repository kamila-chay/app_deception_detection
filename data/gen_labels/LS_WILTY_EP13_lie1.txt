Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip now, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. On one hand, the person has this tight, downturned mouth—like they're frowning or holding back something—and their chin is moving up and down a bit, which feels a bit restless. They also keep looking away from the person they're talking to, glancing down or sideways sometimes, and their head tilts and turns a lot. That *could* read as nervousness or trying to avoid direct engagement, which people often associate with lying. I've heard that avoiding eye contact or shifting gaze can be a sign, so that's making me lean toward "maybe lying" for a second.

But then... they're still looking at the person most of the time, which feels more like they're trying to be present, not hiding. And that chin movement? I've seen people do that when they're just thinking hard or feeling stressed about something unrelated—like maybe they're tired or frustrated with the situation, not necessarily lying. The head tilting and side-turning also seem like natural gestures, not the kind of exaggerated "I'm hiding" stuff I've heard about in deception studies. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic "tells" like blinking a lot, covering their mouth, or fidgeting with their hands. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those physical signs, but they're pretty still otherwise.

I guess the real question is, what's the context? If this is someone answering a simple question about their day, that frown might just be them being serious or annoyed. But if it's a high-stakes situation—like denying something they did—the cues might mean more. Without knowing, it's hard to say. Honestly, I'm not convinced they're lying, but I also can't rule it out entirely. It feels more like they're just... uncomfortable or distracted, not actively deceptive. Maybe they're just not a great liar, or maybe they're genuinely upset about whatever they're talking about. I'd say it's probably not deception, but I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd feel confident about it. It's one of those cases where it's easy to misread body language if you're not in their head.

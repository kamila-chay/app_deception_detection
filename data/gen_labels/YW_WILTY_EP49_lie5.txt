Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tricky because they're not showing any of the obvious "tells" people usually expect from liars—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or looking away a lot. Their gaze is actually locked right on the person they're talking to the whole time, which feels like it should be a sign of honesty, not deception. And they've got their palms up, which usually comes across as open and genuine. No nervous gestures at all—no rubbing hands, no scratching, nothing. It’s almost too calm, which makes me wonder if they're really relaxed or if they're just really good at hiding it.

But then again, I've heard that some people who lie *do* manage to stay super still and make steady eye contact—they might even overdo the "open" gestures like palms up to seem trustworthy. So maybe that calmness is actually a tactic. The fact that they're not blinking a lot or making exaggerated facial expressions could also be a sign they're rehearsed or focused on not slipping up. Like, they might be so worried about giving themselves away that they're suppressing natural reactions.

On the flip side, if they *were* telling the truth, this kind of composure makes sense—people who are honest often don't get as jittery. The steady eye contact and open palms feel like they're just being engaged and sincere. I guess the counterargument is that the lack of *any* nervousness is suspicious for a lie, but it could just mean they're confident in what they're saying. I’m not an expert, though—sometimes truth-tellers get nervous too, and sometimes liars don’t show a single sign. Honestly, I’d lean toward them being truthful just because the behavior seems so natural and consistent, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It’s one of those cases where the video doesn’t give me a clear answer, and I’d need more context to feel sure.

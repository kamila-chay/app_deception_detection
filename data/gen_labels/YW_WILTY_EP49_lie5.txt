Based on what I’m observing in the video, I’m inclined to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. They avoid the usual nervous behaviors associated with deception, such as fidgeting or looking away, maintaining steady eye contact and open palms throughout, which typically suggest honesty. However, this very calmness and lack of any nervous gestures strike me as potentially deliberate. Some people who lie do manage to control their behaviors carefully, using steady eye contact and open gestures like palms up to appear trustworthy. The absence of blinking or natural facial expressions could indicate that they’re very focused on not giving themselves away, perhaps rehearsed or consciously suppressing genuine reactions. While such composure could align with truthfulness, the almost too-perfect calmness raises a suspicion that it might be a tactic to mask deception. So, while I’m not completely sure and would need more context to be certain, I tend to suspect that they might be concealing the truth.

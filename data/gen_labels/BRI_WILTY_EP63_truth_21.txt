Hmm, watching this clip, I'm a bit torn. The person's shaking their head a lot—like, really consistently—and that's the first thing that stands out. Normally, I'd think head shaking might mean they're denying something, which could be a red flag for lying, especially if they're saying "no" to a question. But then I notice they're not doing any of the other classic "lying" things people usually do: no fidgeting, no weird blinking, no looking away nervously, and they're actually not making eye contact with the person they're talking to. Wait, that part's confusing—avoiding eye contact is often a sign of deception, right? But they're not sweating it out or shifting around either, which makes me wonder if the eye contact thing is just how they naturally act, maybe from shyness or just how they're used to communicating.  

The head shaking is the weird part. It could be a habit—like some people just do that when they're talking, even when they're being honest. I've seen it before, where someone shakes their head while saying "no" to something that's actually true, and it's just their way of emphasizing it. If they're shaking their head while saying "I didn't do it," and it's true, the gesture matches the truth, so it wouldn't be a lie. But without hearing the words, it's hard to tell. The fact that they're not showing other stress signs—like lips tightening or hands moving—makes me lean toward them being truthful. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more of that nervous energy. But head shaking alone? It's not a solid indicator, and I've read enough about how unreliable those cues are that I shouldn't overthink it.  

Still, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the head shaking is a subconscious tell, or maybe the eye contact thing is a bigger clue than I'm giving it credit for. But honestly, the lack of other behaviors feels more telling than the head shaking. I'd guess they're telling the truth, but I'd be hesitant to say it for sure—there's just too much room for it to be a habit or a cultural thing. It's one of those cases where the absence of "obvious" lies might actually mean they're being honest, even if the head shaking looks a bit off at first glance.

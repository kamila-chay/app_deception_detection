Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% sure, but it feels like they're probably telling the truth. They're smiling a bit and have that slight raised-eyebrow thing going on—like they're genuinely surprised or engaged in the conversation, not like they're trying to hide something. Their eyes are locked on the person they're talking to, which usually feels more natural for someone being honest, and they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting with their hands like I'd expect if they were nervous about lying. The head tilting and that little side-turn seem like normal conversational gestures, not the stiff, rehearsed movements I've seen in people who are trying to cover up something. And that shrug at the end? It just looks like they're saying "I don't know" or "that's just how it is," which fits with being straightforward.

But honestly, I could be wrong. Frequent blinking can sometimes mean someone's stressed or trying to think of what to say, which might happen when they're lying, though it could also just be because they're tired or the lighting's weird. And the head shaking—well, people shake their heads for all sorts of reasons, not just to deny something. If they were lying, I'd maybe expect them to look away more or have that tight-lipped, forced smile, but they're actually smiling naturally and even have their chin moving up a bit like they're leaning into the conversation. Still, it's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're talking about. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe they're genuinely unsure about what they're saying, which wouldn't mean they're lying—it could just mean they're being honest but hesitant. I'd lean toward truth, but I'd want to hear the whole context before I'd feel confident about it.

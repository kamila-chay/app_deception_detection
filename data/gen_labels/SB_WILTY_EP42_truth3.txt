Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't super clear-cut. They're not doing anything that immediately screams "liar" to me—like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting a lot. In fact, they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which often feels more natural when someone's being honest. They're nodding along too, which seems like a normal part of conversation, not something people usually do when they're trying to cover up something.  

But then there are a few things that make me pause. They're raising their eyebrows a lot, which I've heard can sometimes happen when someone's surprised or trying to seem sincere, but I've also seen it in people who are nervous—maybe even lying. And their chin is moving downward a few times, like they're pressing it in or thinking hard, which could be either deep concentration (like recalling a real memory) or just discomfort. They also glance down occasionally while talking, which I've read some people do when they're gathering their thoughts, but others say it's a sign of deception.  

The thing that leans me toward truth, though, is how *calm* they seem overall. No frantic blinking, no lip biting, no hands covering their face—those are the classic "nervous liar" signs, and they're completely missing here. If they were making something up, I'd expect at least a little more physical tension. Plus, the head tilting and side-turning feel natural, like they're just engaged in the conversation, not trying to hide anything.  

That said, I can't be totally sure. Some really skilled liars don't show those physical tells at all, and maybe they're just a naturally expressive person with those eyebrow raises. Or maybe the downward chin is just how they talk, not a sign of anything. I guess I'm leaning toward them being truthful because the absence of obvious deception cues is pretty strong, but I'd want to hear more of the conversation to be certain. It just doesn't *feel* like they're hiding something, even if it's not 100% obvious. Like, if I were talking to them, I'd probably trust them, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's one of those cases where the behavior is just... ordinary, which makes me think it's probably true.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video alone, honestly. The person isn't smiling or laughing, which might make me think they're being serious, but that's not really a tell for lying—truthful people don't always smile, especially if they're nervous or thoughtful. What stands out to me is they're raising their eyebrows a lot and looking down or sideways instead of directly at the camera. At first glance, I thought, "Oh, they're avoiding eye contact—classic liar sign!" But then I remembered that's actually a myth; some people just naturally look away when they're thinking or feeling uncomfortable, even when telling the truth. Like, maybe they're just shy or processing what they're saying. 

The thing is, they're not doing other classic "lying" things—no frowning, no lip biting, no frantic blinking, nothing exaggerated with their mouth. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical tension, like fidgeting or tense shoulders, but their hands are still, and they're not crossing arms or anything. The raised eyebrows could mean they're surprised by the question or skeptical, not necessarily deceptive. Maybe they're just trying to remember something accurately. 

But wait—could the gaze down/sideways be a sign of guilt? I've heard some people say liars look away to avoid scrutiny. But honestly, I've seen so many videos where people look down while being completely truthful, especially in interviews or when they're not used to being filmed. It might just be their natural way of speaking. The lack of other stress cues makes me lean toward them being genuine, but I can't rule out that they're a really good liar who's not showing signs. Like, maybe they're practiced at staying calm. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The behavior doesn't scream "liar" to me, but it also doesn't scream "truth" either. It feels more like someone who's just... present in the moment, maybe a little hesitant, but not necessarily hiding something. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—before I'd feel confident about it. People's body language varies so much; what looks like a "tell" to one person might just be their personality to another.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not—it's pretty ambiguous. On one hand, they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? Like, people who lie often avoid looking directly at you, so that's a point in their favor. They also have their arms open with palms up, which generally reads as open and non-threatening—like they're trying to be transparent. And there's no nervous stuff like fidgeting, covering their mouth, or excessive blinking, which are things I'd expect if they were stressed about lying.  

But then there are some things that make me pause. Their eyebrows are both raised *and* furrowed at the same time? That's kind of odd—it looks like they're confused or caught off guard, not necessarily lying, but it’s not the calm, steady expression I’d associate with someone being completely truthful. And their lip corners are pulled down, which feels like they're genuinely upset or frustrated about whatever they're saying, not necessarily hiding something. The head moving backward a bit could be hesitation, but it’s not a huge, obvious gesture like a sharp head shake.  

The thing that really throws me is the arms—both "arms open" and "arms folded" are marked as true? That seems physically impossible unless it's a quick, confusing movement I'm not catching, but it might just be a misinterpretation in the way the video was analyzed. If it's a mistake, it doesn't help me, but if it's real, it adds to the confusion. Honestly, the lack of classic "lie" signs (like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting) leans me toward them being truthful, but the mixed facial expressions make me wonder if they're just really stressed about the topic, not lying. I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth, but I can't rule out that the nervousness they're showing is because they *are* hiding something. It’s just not clear-cut enough to call it a lie. If I had to guess, I’d say truth, but I’d still be second-guessing it.

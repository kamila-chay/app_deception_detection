Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they're not doing any of the obvious "lying" things people usually expect—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or smiling nervously. They're just sitting there, not smiling, not frowning, not moving much at all. The only thing that stands out is how often they're blinking—like, really frequently. I've heard people say that excessive blinking can be a sign of stress or lying, so at first glance, that makes me pause. But then I think, wait, I blink a lot when I'm tired or just concentrating on something, right? Maybe they're just tired, or the lighting in the room is bothering their eyes. 

On the flip side, they're not avoiding eye contact either—they're actually looking straight ahead, not darting their gaze around or down like some people do when they're hiding something. There's no sign of them crossing their arms, scratching their face, or any of those classic nervous habits. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those tells, but there's nothing like that. It just feels... calm. Like they're just answering a straightforward question without any extra energy. 

But then I second-guess myself because, yeah, the blinking is weird. Maybe it's a habit, or maybe they're just uncomfortable in general. I've seen people with dry eyes blink a lot, and it has nothing to do with lying. Honestly, though, the absence of *any* other signs makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more than just blinking—like maybe a slight shift in posture or a hesitation. Here, it's just... steady. Quiet. So I'm leaning toward "truth" based on how relaxed they seem overall, but I'd be lying if I said I'm 100% sure. It's just that the blinking doesn't feel like a lie to me—it feels more like a minor detail that could have a totally innocent explanation. I guess I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd bet on it.

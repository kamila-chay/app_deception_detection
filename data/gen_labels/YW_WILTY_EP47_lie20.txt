Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person seems a bit... off, but I'm trying not to jump to conclusions. They're raising their eyebrows a lot—like, consistently, even when they're answering the question. And their gaze is mostly down, not really meeting the other person's eyes. That makes me think maybe they're uncomfortable or trying to avoid something, but I know that's not always a sign of lying. Sometimes people look down when they're just thinking hard or feeling shy, right? Like, I do that when I'm trying to remember something.

Then there's the little upturn at the corners of their mouth—almost like a faint smile, but not really a full smile. It feels a bit forced, like they're trying to seem relaxed while they're actually nervous. That's the part that makes me lean toward "maybe they're not being totally honest," because when people are lying, they sometimes fake smiles to seem friendly. But wait—could it just be a reflex? Like, maybe they're just trying to be polite or they're genuinely trying to answer without seeming rude? I mean, I've seen people do that when they're just awkward in the moment.

On the flip side, their eyes aren't darting around, they're not blinking a ton, and they're not fidgeting with their hands or anything. Those are usually bigger red flags for me when I'm trying to spot lies. So if they're not doing those things, maybe it's not about deception. Maybe they're just tired, or the question caught them off guard, or they're from a culture where looking down is normal when listening. I've heard that in some places, avoiding eye contact isn't about lying—it's just respect.

Honestly, I'm stuck between two thoughts. The raised brows and the down gaze feel like they're trying to mask something, but the lack of other classic "lie" cues makes me doubt it. I'd probably ask them a follow-up question to see if their story holds together, but just from the video? I can't say for sure. It's possible they're being truthful but just really uncomfortable, or it's possible they're hiding something. I'd lean toward "maybe" they're not being fully honest, but I'm definitely not confident. Like, I'd need more context before I'd call it a lie.

Honestly, while I'm not completely certain, the cues I'm seeing seem to lean more toward the possibility that the person might be lying. The consistent nodding could be a way to appear agreeable or to buy time rather than a natural habit. Their frequent downward gaze is also notable; although some people look down when thinking or being honest, it's often associated with nervousness or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact when hiding something. The finger-crossing gesture feels deliberate and could be interpreted as a subconscious effort to mask the truth, even though some might just fidget or try to calm themselves. The lack of smiling or laughter in what might be a casual conversation seems unusual, hinting that they might be uncomfortable or guarded. They do glance up at the camera occasionally, which complicates the picture, but overall, the mix of these behaviors suggests a higher likelihood of deception. Still, without more context or understanding of their typical behavior, I can't say for sureâ€”just that the balance of evidence makes me lean toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful.

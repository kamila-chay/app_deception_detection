Looking at the clip, I’m not entirely sure, but there are a few things that stand out. The person’s blinking seems really frequent—like way more than normal—almost like they’re trying to avoid making eye contact, which I’ve heard can be a sign of deception. But I know blinking can also just be from tiredness or bright lights, so that’s not definitive. They’re also looking directly at the person they’re talking to, which is interesting because some people who lie avoid eye contact, but others might overcompensate by staring too hard to seem honest. Then there’s the head shaking—like, they keep shaking it side to side while speaking, which feels a bit odd. If they’re denying something, it might seem like they’re trying to emphasize their point, but it could just be a habitual gesture. They’re nodding a lot too, which might come across as overly agreeable, like they’re trying too hard to seem genuine. But honestly, I’ve seen people do that when they’re just being friendly or thoughtful, not necessarily lying. The thing is, they don’t seem nervous in other ways—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. If they were really stressed about lying, I’d expect more physical signs, but maybe they’re good at hiding it. All in all, the blinking and head movements make me lean toward "maybe deception," but I’m not confident at all because those cues can easily be misread. It’s one of those cases where without knowing the context—like what they’re even talking about—it’s hard to say for sure. I’d probably hesitate to call it lying without more evidence.

Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm actually a bit torn. On one hand, there are some things that make me lean toward them not being entirely truthful. They're making pretty consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's usually a good sign for honesty, right? But then there's this weird combination of the head side-turning and the sideways glance, like they're avoiding direct focus even while looking at the person. That feels off to me. And the way their chin lifts up a bit when they're speaking—like a little defensive chin raise—sometimes I've noticed that when people are trying to seem more confident than they are, especially if they're nervous about what they're saying. The eyebrows raised too, which can look like they're trying to seem surprised or engaged, but it's a bit forced, not natural like when you're genuinely reacting.

On the other hand, they're not doing any of the obvious "lie signs" we often hear about—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact completely, no fake smiles or awkward pauses. They seem pretty composed otherwise, and the direct gaze they maintain most of the time feels genuine. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows, or maybe they're just really nervous about the topic in a way that's not related to lying. I've known people who do the head-turn thing when they're thinking hard, not necessarily when they're hiding something. 

Honestly, it's really hard to call. The head movement and sideways glance are nagging at me, but the steady eye contact and lack of other nervous tells are pulling me the other way. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're being a little evasive, but I'm not 100% sure. It could just be their normal way of talking when they're concentrating. I wouldn't bet the farm on it either way.

Looking closely at this clip, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that the person might not be entirely truthful. While they do maintain fairly consistent eye contact, which often suggests honesty, the subtle head side-turning combined with a sideways glance seems like an attempt to avoid fully engaging with the other person. This behavior feels somewhat indicative of discomfort or evasion. Additionally, the slight lifting of their chin could be a defensive gesture, as if they’re trying to project confidence to cover up nervousness about what they're saying. Their raised eyebrows, which might be an effort to appear surprised or engaged, come across as somewhat forced rather than genuine.

Although they don’t exhibit some of the more blatant signs often linked to deceit—there’s no excessive fidgeting, no outright avoidance of eye contact, no fake smiles or awkward pauses—they do seem to exhibit a subtle mix of cues that don’t quite add up. It’s possible these behaviors stem from natural expressiveness or nervousness unrelated to deception, but given the overall combination and slight incongruence of their actions, I tend to suspect they might be bending the truth a bit. I wouldn’t say I’m certain, but on balance, I lean toward them not being completely honest.

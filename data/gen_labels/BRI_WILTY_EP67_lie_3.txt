Honestly, this is a tricky one because body language alone can be quite ambiguous. At first glance, the person appears fairly calm, with a neutral expression—neither smiling nor frowning—which might not fit the typical image of someone trying to lie by forcing a smile or looking overly serious. Their open hands and palms-up gesture usually suggest honesty or openness, which could argue against deception. 

However, there are some subtle signs that give me pause. The slight backward movement of the head is somewhat unusual for someone giving a straightforward answer; normally, you'd expect someone who is truthful to lean in or maintain more steady posture, whereas pulling away might hint at some discomfort or reluctance. Additionally, their eyes darting down and sideways frequently could be interpreted as evasive, despite the fact that some people naturally look away when thinking or feeling shy. 

The raised eyebrows are genuine and relaxed, not forced, possibly indicating surprise or skepticism rather than deceit. Yet, the overall combination—the head pulling back mixed with the evasive eye movements—leans slightly toward the idea that they might be holding something back or not being entirely forthright. Although their open posture typically suggests honesty, it might also be a deliberate attempt to appear sincere.

Taking all this into account, while there's no definitive proof they're lying, my impression is that deception is a plausible possibility here. I wouldn't be fully confident in declaring them truthful, and I tend to lean toward the idea that they might not be telling the whole truth, even if it’s just a subtle pretense rather than an outright lie.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure—this is tricky because body language alone is such a messy clue. From what I'm seeing in the clip, the person seems pretty calm overall. They're not smiling or frowning, which is interesting because when people lie, they often try to force a smile or look overly serious, but here they're just... neutral. Their hands are open with palms up and arms out, which usually feels like someone trying to seem honest or open, not deceptive. But then, their head is moving backward a bit, like they're pulling away from the camera, and their eyes are darting down and sideways a lot—those are the parts that make me pause. I've heard people say looking away can mean lying, but I've also read that it's not reliable; some people just look down when they're thinking hard, or maybe they're shy or processing the question.  

The thing that sticks with me is the raised eyebrows—they're not fake or forced, just genuinely raised, like they're surprised or skeptical about something. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in their face, but it's relaxed. And the gaze shifts? Could be nervousness, but it could also just be how they naturally talk—some people look down when they're gathering their thoughts, not because they're hiding something.  

On the flip side, the head moving backward feels a bit odd for a straightforward answer. If they were telling the truth, I'd expect them to lean in or stay still, but pulling back might signal discomfort. Still, I don't know the context—maybe they're talking about something heavy, like a personal story, and that's why they're shifting away. And honestly, the open posture (palms up, arms open) is working against the "lying" idea for me. Most people don't do that when they're being deceptive; they tend to cross arms or cover up.  

I guess I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but it's so close. The gestures feel more like someone who's thoughtful or maybe even a little hesitant about the topic, not necessarily lying. But I'd need to hear what they're saying to be sure—without the words, it's just a bunch of signals that could mean a lot of things. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably not deception, but I wouldn't bet my paycheck on it. It's one of those moments where you just have to trust your gut, and mine's saying "maybe not," but I'm definitely not certain.

Based on what I'm watching, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'm not totally convinced—there are a few things that make me pause. The way they're sitting with their arms open and their gaze mostly directed toward the person they're talking to feels pretty genuine to me. Open arms usually signal receptiveness, not defensiveness, and they're not avoiding eye contact like a lot of people do when they're nervous or lying. They also have this slight head tilt while looking sideways, which seems like a natural, engaged thing people do when listening or thinking, not something staged. 

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes really practiced liars *do* mimic that calm, open posture to seem trustworthy. Like, they might know not to fidget or look away, so they just sit there perfectly still. And that sideways glance—while it could be just them processing what they're saying—might also be a subtle way to avoid direct eye contact, which some people do when they're not being honest. I've seen that before in other videos where someone's trying too hard to seem relaxed. 

Also, the fact that they're not showing any of those classic "nervous" signs—no fidgeting, no forced smiles, no rapid blinking—makes me think they're either really comfortable with the situation or really good at hiding it. Honestly, I'm split. If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd say truth, but I'd be wary because lying can look deceptively calm. It's not like they're sweating or looking around frantically, which would be a bigger red flag for lying, but the absence of stress cues isn't a perfect guarantee either. I'd want to hear more of what they're saying to be sure.

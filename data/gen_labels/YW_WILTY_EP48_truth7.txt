Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, the way they're holding themselves feels pretty open—palms up, arms relaxed and open, and they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That usually makes me lean toward them being honest because liars often avoid eye contact or cross their arms. They're also nodding along, which feels natural for someone engaged in a conversation, not like they're trying to force agreement. The raised eyebrows and that slight downturn in their lip corners seem like they're genuinely processing what they're saying, maybe even a little hesitant or thoughtful, which could match someone being truthful about something they care about. The chin moving upward feels confident, not like they're trying to hide something.

But then I keep second-guessing because smiles can be tricky—people sometimes smile to seem friendly or calm when they're nervous, even if they're lying. And while they're not laughing or frowning, that downturned lip might just be their default expression, not a sign of emotion. I've seen people use "open" gestures like palms up when they're trying to seem sincere, even if they're not. The lack of blinking or fidgeting is a good sign, but I've also heard that some liars can be overly calm, so that might not mean much here. 

Honestly, the most convincing part for me is the direct eye contact combined with the open posture—they don't seem like they're trying to create distance or hide. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like avoiding the gaze or shifting in their seat, but they seem settled. Still, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe they're just good at masking it, or maybe they're telling the truth about something that actually makes them feel uneasy, hence the downturned lips. I'm leaning toward truth based on what I'm seeing, but I'd want to hear more context before I'd say for certain. It feels like they're being genuine, but it's hard to rule out the possibility that they're just very practiced at this.

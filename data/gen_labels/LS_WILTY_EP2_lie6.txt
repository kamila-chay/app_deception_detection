Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% certain, but I'm leaning toward this person possibly not being entirely truthful. The way they're moving their chin up and down while speaking feels a bit unnatural to me—like they're trying to emphasize points but it comes across as forced, almost like they're rehearsing. Their eyebrows are raised a lot too, which often happens when someone's trying to seem calm or engaged while actually feeling stressed, but I know raised eyebrows can also just be surprise or curiosity, so that's not definitive. They're also looking down a lot while still keeping their gaze toward the person they're talking to, which feels like they're avoiding direct eye contact but trying to seem attentive at the same time. The head tilting sideways and nodding seem a bit overdone, like they're overcompensating for something.  

But honestly, it's really hard to say for sure. I keep wondering if they're just really nervous about the situation—maybe they're in a high-pressure interview or talking about something personal, and that's why their body language feels off. The chin movements could be a habit they've picked up, or maybe they're just naturally expressive. And the fact that they're nodding and keeping eye contact (even if it's downward) might actually suggest they're trying to be convincing, which could mean they're being truthful but anxious. I've seen people act similarly when they're genuinely upset or confused, not necessarily lying.  

So yeah, I'm leaning toward deception because of the combination of the chin movement, the raised eyebrows, and the downward gaze, but I'm not ruling out nervousness. It's the kind of thing where you'd need more context—like what they're even talking about—to feel confident. If I had to guess without knowing anything else, I'd say maybe, but it's not a slam dunk.

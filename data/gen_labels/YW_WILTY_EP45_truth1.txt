Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I'd need more context to feel confident. The main thing that stands out is their eye contact: they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels pretty natural. But they also glance down occasionally, which is interesting. I've heard people say liars look away, but I think that's not always true—some people look down when they're being honest and thinking carefully, like they're recalling something. And honestly, they don't seem nervous at all. No fidgeting, no weird mouth movements, no over-the-top gestures. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little sign of stress, like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely, but they're just... calm. 

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes people look down when they're lying to seem humble or avoid confrontation, right? Like, maybe they're trying to appear sincere, which could backfire. And it's true—some liars *do* maintain eye contact to seem confident, so the fact that they're looking at the person doesn't *prove* truthfulness. But the combination of steady eye contact *plus* no other nervous tells? That feels more like someone who's just being straightforward. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a little more "off" in their body language, like shifting around or touching their face. But they're just sitting there, talking normally. 

Honestly, I'm not going to call it a slam dunk, but based on what I see, I'd guess they're being truthful. It's not the *most* obvious sign, but it's the strongest thing I've noticed. If I had to bet, I'd say truth, but I'd still want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. Like, maybe they're just really good at staying calm, or maybe they're genuinely thinking about their answer. Either way, the video doesn't show the classic "lying" signs that make me doubt them.

Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because so much of this stuff can be misread. What stands out to me is how often they're blinking—like, really frequently, almost like they're trying to avoid looking at the camera. That makes me lean toward them possibly being stressed or hiding something, since I've heard blinking a lot can be a sign of discomfort when someone's not being straight. But then again, I've seen people blink like that when they're just tired or in a bright room, so it could totally be something else.  

Their eyes also keep drifting sideways a bit, not quite meeting the person they're talking to directly. That feels a bit off—like they're not fully engaged. But I know some people naturally look sideways when they're thinking, especially if they're trying to remember something, so it might not mean they're lying. Then there's the head tilting, which they do a few times. That's usually a sign of curiosity or trying to understand, but I guess it could be a nervous tic if they're faking it.  

On the flip side, their body language seems open—palms up, arms relaxed and spread out, not crossed or closed off. That usually reads as honest to me, like they're trying to seem trustworthy. If they were lying, I'd expect them to be more guarded, like arms folded or hands covering their face. But maybe they're just being overly friendly to cover up the lie? I'm not sure.  

The thing that really throws me is that they're actually looking at the person sometimes—they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact entirely, just glancing away occasionally. So it's not like they're completely avoiding the interaction, which makes me wonder if the blinking and sideways looks are just nerves from the situation, not deception.  

Honestly, I'd be hesitant to call it a definitive sign either way. The blinking and gaze shifts make me think *maybe* they're not being fully truthful, but the open posture and lack of other classic tells (like fidgeting or forced smiles) make me doubt it. Without knowing what they're being asked about or the context, it's really hard to say. I guess I'd lean a tiny bit toward deception just because of the blinking, but I'd definitely want more to go on before I'd be sure. It's one of those cases where it feels like they're holding something back, but it could also just be them being a little awkward.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always straightforward. They're not smiling or laughing, which sometimes people do when they're nervous or trying to seem friendly while lying, but they're also not frowning or scowling, which feels neutral. The thing that stands out to me is how they keep raising their eyebrows—like they're genuinely surprised or processing something the other person said. And they're nodding a lot while looking down at their hands or the table, not making eye contact. 

At first, I thought "looking down" might mean they're hiding something, like they're avoiding eye contact because they're lying. But I've read that people often look down when they're thinking carefully or being sincere, especially if they're not used to being questioned. Like, they might be focusing on their thoughts instead of trying to fake a response. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" stuff—no rapid blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no lip biting. If they were lying, I'd expect them to seem more tense, but they seem pretty calm. The nodding feels like genuine agreement or understanding, not like they're trying to convince someone. 

That said, I can see how someone might think they're lying. If you're used to seeing liars avoid eye contact, the down gaze might trigger that instinct. And raising eyebrows can sometimes happen when someone's trying to remember a lie, but it's not a sure sign. Still, the lack of other stress cues—like the absence of crossed arms, shaky hands, or forced smiles—makes me lean toward them being truthful. It just seems like they're being thoughtful, not deceptive. I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're being honest than not. Maybe it's because they're just the type of person who looks down when they're concentrating, and the eyebrows are just a natural reaction to what's being said. I'd say it's probably truth, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at hiding it.

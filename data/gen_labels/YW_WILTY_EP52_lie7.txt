Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean a little toward them telling the truth, though I can't say for certain. The thing that stands out most is how they keep raising their eyebrows a couple of times while talking—like when they're explaining the part about the meeting getting rescheduled. It feels a bit like they're genuinely surprised or trying to emphasize something, but I know raised eyebrows can sometimes happen when people are stressed, so that *could* be a sign they're not comfortable. But then, they're also looking right at the person asking the question the whole time, which usually makes me think they're trying to seem sincere, not deceptive. I've heard that liars sometimes overdo eye contact to seem honest, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

On the flip side, though, there's nothing else that screams "lying" to me. No fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to find words—they're speaking pretty smoothly. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs like that, like maybe shifting in their seat or looking away when they're making up details. The fact that they're not doing any of those things makes me think maybe they're just nervous about the question, not necessarily lying. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so the raised eyebrows could still be a red herring. Honestly, it's really hard to tell from just this clip alone—maybe they're just a naturally expressive person with a habit of raising their eyebrows when they talk, and the direct eye contact is just how they are. I'd want to see more context or hear the actual conversation to feel more confident, but based on what I'm seeing, I don't have a strong feeling they're lying. It just feels like they're being straightforward, even if they're a bit tense.

Honestly, while it's tricky to be certain, I find myself leaning somewhat toward the possibility that they might not be telling the full truth. The repeated eyebrow raises during their explanation about the meeting rescheduling could suggest genuine surprise or emphasis, but raised eyebrows can also be a subtle sign of discomfort or stress, which sometimes accompanies deception. Their steady eye contact might initially suggest sincerity, but I'm aware that some people intentionally maintain strong eye contact to appear honest, which complicates the interpretation. 

On the other hand, they don’t exhibit more overt signs typically associated with lying—there’s no fidgeting, avoiding gaze, or awkward pauses, and their speech flows smoothly. These factors could indicate nervousness rather than dishonesty. However, considering some individuals are skilled at masking deception, the eyebrow movement might be misleading. Without additional context or more information about the conversation, it’s challenging to draw a firm conclusion, but given the mix of cues, I tend to lean slightly toward the idea that they might be concealing something.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it seems like they're probably telling the truth. The way they're holding their gaze directly toward the person they're talking to—like they're actually engaged and not avoiding eye contact—feels like a strong sign of sincerity. And their gaze being up, not down or sideways, makes me think they're just thinking or recalling something, which is totally normal when answering honestly. I don't see any of the usual "liar tells" either: no nervous blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where they're just staring at the floor, and no fake smiles or scowls. They seem pretty calm and relaxed overall.  

But I guess I can see why someone might second-guess it. Sometimes really practiced liars can keep their composure perfectly, so the absence of stress signs doesn't *prove* truthfulness. And technically, looking up while talking could sometimes be a tactic to seem more "thoughtful" when lying—though that's usually paired with other tells like forced pauses or over-enunciation, which I don't see here. Also, cultural differences in eye contact might play a role; if they're used to avoiding direct gaze, maybe they're just being polite, but the description says they're *maintaining* it, which feels intentional.  

Still, the combination of steady eye contact, no physical anxiety cues, and a straightforward posture makes it feel more likely they're being genuine. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* sign of tension—like fidgeting or a slight shift in their gaze—but everything here seems consistent and natural. It's not a slam-dunk, but based on what I'm watching, I'd lean toward truth. Like, it just *looks* like someone answering honestly without trying too hard to seem convincing.

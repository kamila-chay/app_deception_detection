Watching the clip, I noticed the person is smiling while they talk, which feels a bit off—like they're forcing it to seem friendly, especially since they're also raising their eyebrows a lot, almost like they're trying to look surprised or innocent. Their chin is tucked down a bit, which I've heard can sometimes signal defensiveness or stress when someone's not being truthful. They're also looking up frequently while nodding and keeping eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which is interesting because people often avoid eye contact when lying, but not always. Sometimes people look up when they're trying to remember something, which could be honest. 

On the flip side, though, that smile and the eyebrow raises might just be them being overly polite or nervous about the topic—maybe they're not lying but just uncomfortable. The chin movement could be casual, like they're just adjusting their posture, and the nodding feels natural, not forced. I've seen people do all these things when they're telling the truth but just a bit anxious, like during an interview. Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure. The signs lean a little toward deception, but I keep second-guessing because context matters so much—what are they even talking about? If it's something they're genuinely excited about, the smile might be real. I'd hesitate to call it a lie without more to go on, but I can't shake that feeling they're holding something back. It's probably not a clear-cut case either way.

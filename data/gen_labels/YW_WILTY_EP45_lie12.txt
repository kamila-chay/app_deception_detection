Watching the clip, the person’s smile seems somewhat forced, as if they're trying too hard to appear friendly, especially combined with the frequent eyebrow raises that come across as an attempt to seem surprised or innocent. Their chin is slightly tucked down, which can sometimes indicate defensiveness or stress when someone isn’t being completely truthful. The frequent upward glances, paired with nodding and consistent eye contact, are curious; while people often avoid eye contact if they’re lying, some do look up when fabricating or trying to recall details. 

Although it’s possible that the smile and eyebrow movements are just signs of politeness or nervousness, and the chin movement might simply be a casual adjustment, the combination of these cues leans me toward suspecting some level of deception. The nodding seems natural, but that doesn't necessarily rule out dishonesty. It’s difficult to be certain without more context, and the person’s behavior could also reflect anxiety rather than lying. Still, overall, I’m inclined to think there’s a chance they might not be fully truthful, even if it’s not an obvious or clear-cut case.

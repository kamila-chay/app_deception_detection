Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying—I'm really trying to stay neutral here—but after watching the clip a few times, there are a few things that stick out to me. They're blinking way more than usual, like almost constantly, which often happens when people are stressed or trying to hold back something. Their lips are pulled down at the corners, and they keep looking down instead of meeting the camera, which feels like they're avoiding eye contact. There's also this repeated chin movement upward, like they're trying to push their jaw up a bit, and they're shaking their head while talking, which sometimes happens when people are trying to convince themselves or others.  

That said, I keep second-guessing myself because it could just be them being nervous or uncomfortable about the topic—not necessarily lying. Maybe they're genuinely upset about whatever they're discussing, and that's why their lips are downturned and they're looking away. The frequent blinking might just be from being tired or overthinking, not deception. And the head tilting and nodding could easily be natural reactions to the conversation, not signs of lying. I've seen people act like this in interviews or when they're just not sure how to respond, and it's not always about hiding something.  

If I had to guess based on what I saw, I'd lean toward them not being fully truthful—those avoidance cues and the physical tension feel off—but I'm really not confident. It's so easy to misread stress for deception, and without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to tell. Maybe they're just having a bad day, and the behavior is unrelated to lying. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear their words before I'd feel sure. For now, it's a maybe, but I'd say the signs point a little more toward deception than not, even if it's not a slam dunk.

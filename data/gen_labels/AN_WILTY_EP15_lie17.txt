Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but watching the clip, it's making me lean toward deception, though I'm really not 100% confident. The exaggerated eye opening stood out to me right away—it's not something people usually do when they're relaxed or telling the truth. It feels a bit forced, like they're trying to look extra attentive or maybe even "wide-eyed" in a way that doesn't match their actual emotion. And the lip corners down? That’s kind of unsettling—it’s not a natural smile, just a flat, downturned mouth, which often shows discomfort or tension, not calmness. The head tilting while they’re speaking also feels a bit off; it’s not the casual, curious tilt I’d see in someone being honest, more like they’re trying to appear thoughtful but it’s a little too deliberate.

But here’s where I’m doubting myself: they’re looking directly at the camera the whole time, which usually goes against the "liar avoids eye contact" stereotype. And their palms are up, open and visible—people often do that when they're trying to seem sincere or open, not deceptive. I’ve seen a lot of videos where people with palms up are genuinely trying to be transparent. Plus, the head tilt could just be a nervous habit, not necessarily a lie. Maybe they’re just really stressed about whatever they’re talking about, not lying about it. The downturned lips might mean they’re upset about the situation, not that they’re lying.

I guess the thing that keeps me leaning toward deception is that combination—the exaggerated eyes and the downturned mouth feel like they’re trying to *perform* something, like they’re overcompensating. But honestly, it’s so close. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s probably deception, but I’d want more context—like what they’re actually saying or if they’ve been under stress. It’s easy to misread a single gesture, especially with how expressive some people are. I’d say it’s a maybe, but the cues point more toward deception than truth. Still, I’d hesitate to call it for sure without hearing the words or seeing more of their baseline behavior.

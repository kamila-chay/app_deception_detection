Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to tell right away. The person seems pretty calm overall—they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, and they're actually smiling a little, just the corners of their lips up, not a full grin. That's interesting because sometimes people try to fake a smile when they're lying, but this feels more relaxed, like they're genuinely comfortable. Their arms are open too, which usually suggests they're not defensive or hiding anything, and they're not doing those classic "lying tells" like covering their mouth or blinking a lot. 

But here's where I start doubting myself: the way they're looking around—gazing up and down a few times—could be a sign they're thinking hard about what they're saying. I've heard that people often look up when they're recalling memories, which might actually be truthful, but it could also be a way to avoid direct eye contact while they're making something up. And that slight smile... well, I know some people smile nervously when they're lying, so it's not a perfect indicator. Like, maybe they're just trying to seem friendly, not necessarily being deceptive. 

On the flip side, they're not doing any of the obvious stress signals—no scowling, no awkward pauses with their mouth shut, no head shaking. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like fidgeting or avoiding the camera. The fact that they're just sitting there, arms open, speaking normally... it feels more like someone who's at ease. I mean, if they were lying, wouldn't they be more careful with their body language? Maybe overcompensating? But they don't seem to be. 

Still, I can't be 100% sure. People are weirdly inconsistent—some liars are super calm, others are jumpy. And cultural stuff plays a role too; maybe looking down is normal for them when they're being honest. Honestly, after watching it a couple times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because everything feels... unforced. Like they're not trying too hard to seem sincere, which is usually a good sign. But yeah, I'm not gonna say "definitely," because I've been wrong before. It's just that the absence of red flags feels louder than the few ambiguous things I saw. So, my gut says truth, but I'd want to hear the context too before I'd bet on it.

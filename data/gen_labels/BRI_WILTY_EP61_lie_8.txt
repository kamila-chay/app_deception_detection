Looking at the clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's a bit of a toss-up. The first thing that stands out is that smile they're giving. It's there, but it doesn't feel super natural to me; it's a bit tight, like they're trying to seem friendly or reassuring. And they're raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really frequently—almost as if they're overdoing the "surprise" or "I'm listening" thing. That *could* be a sign they're trying to seem genuine while they're actually hiding something, since people often fake those reactions when they're not being honest.  

But then there's the chin thing—they keep moving it upward, like a little chin lift, and their head's held pretty high the whole time. I've heard that when people are lying, they often have more nervous, fidgety movements, but this feels more like they're trying to project confidence or control. The head up especially—like they're standing tall, not avoiding eye contact or looking down like someone who's uneasy. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like fidgeting with their hands or avoiding looking at the person they're talking to. But here, they're not doing any of that. The description says they're not looking at the interlocutor, but the head position feels more like they're just focused on something else, not like they're hiding.  

The other thing is the lack of other classic "lying" cues—no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no blinking like crazy. If they were nervous about lying, you'd usually see more of that. But maybe they're just really good at hiding it? Or maybe the smile is just part of their natural expression, and the raised eyebrows are just them being animated. I mean, people do smile and raise eyebrows when they're genuinely engaged, right? It's hard to tell if it's forced or not just from the video alone.  

So yeah, I'm leaning a little toward them *not* lying because of how calm and controlled they seem—especially the chin and head movements. But I can't rule out deception either, because that smile and the eyebrow thing *do* feel a bit rehearsed. It's not like there's a clear "aha" moment here. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're being honest, but I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. It's the kind of thing where you'd need to hear the conversation or see more context to feel confident.

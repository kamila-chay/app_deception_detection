Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I wouldn’t say I’m entirely sure. Their smile, for instance, feels somewhat forced—it’s there, but it seems tight, almost as if they’re trying too hard to appear friendly or reassuring. The frequent eyebrow raises stand out as well, coming across as possibly exaggerated attempts to show surprise or engagement, which can sometimes be a sign someone is masking their true feelings.

The way they keep lifting their chin and holding their head high could be interpreted as an effort to project confidence and control, which might be a tactic to cover up deception rather than a sign of genuine ease. While they don’t display the more typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the fact that they aren’t looking directly at the person they’re speaking to but instead appear focused elsewhere raises a question. It doesn’t necessarily scream nervousness, but it could suggest a subtle attempt to avoid too much direct scrutiny.

Also, the absence of other common cues—like awkward pauses, lip biting, or excessive blinking—might mean they’re just good at hiding any dishonesty, rather than being completely truthful. Of course, it’s possible the smile and expressive eyebrows are natural for them, but combined with the controlled head and chin movements, it makes me suspicious.

Overall, I’m inclined to suspect the person might not be entirely honest here, given these subtle but suggestive behaviors, though there’s no definitive proof. The signs don’t conclusively confirm deception, but I do lean toward thinking there’s a good chance they’re not telling the whole truth. More context would definitely help clarify the situation.

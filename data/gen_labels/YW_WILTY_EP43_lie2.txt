Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I find myself leaning towards the idea that the person might be lying, though I'm not entirely certain. While they do maintain consistent eye contact and have open gestures like nodding and showing palms, which are typically associated with honesty, some of their facial expressions raise questions. The exaggerated mouth opening and raised eyebrows stand out as potential signs of overcompensationâ€”people who are deceptive sometimes amplify their expressions to seem more believable. Additionally, the sideways glances, despite overall eye contact, could suggest some internal hesitation or discomfort. Although the absence of classic stress indicators like fidgeting or avoiding gaze might suggest calmness or truthfulness, it could also mean they are skilled at hiding their deception or are not particularly stressed by their falsehood. Given these mixed signals, I would cautiously lean toward thinking they are probably not being entirely truthful, even though it's not definitive, and further context would help clarify the situation.

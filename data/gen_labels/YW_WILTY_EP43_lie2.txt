Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn about whether they're lying or not. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—which usually feels like a sign of honesty, since liars often avoid direct gaze. They're also nodding along and keeping their palms up, which seems open and non-defensive. Those cues make me lean toward them being truthful, especially since there's no frowning, avoiding eyes, or nervous habits like scratching or rubbing hands, which I'd expect if they were hiding something.  

But then there's that exaggerated mouth opening and the raised eyebrows—those feel a bit off. When people are being deceptive, they sometimes overdo expressions to seem more sincere, like opening their mouth wider to "look genuine" or raising eyebrows to seem surprised or earnest. It’s not a classic lie sign, but it sticks out to me because it feels a little forced, like they're trying too hard to appear calm or honest. The sideways glances too—while they're still looking at the person overall—might hint at some internal hesitation, though it's not full avoidance.  

Honestly, I can see both sides. If they were lying, the lack of obvious stress cues (like rapid blinking or fidgeting) is confusing—it makes me wonder if they're just a naturally calm person who's being truthful. But if they *are* lying, they might be really good at masking it, or the lie isn't something they're stressed about. The raised eyebrows especially could just be surprise at a question, not deception. I’d say it’s ambiguous, but I’m leaning slightly toward them telling the truth because the open gestures and eye contact feel more consistent with sincerity than the few odd cues. Still, I wouldn’t bet money on it—there’s enough uncertainty that I’d want to see more context or hear the actual conversation.

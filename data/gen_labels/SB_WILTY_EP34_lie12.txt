Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is how they're holding their face—there's a definite frown, eyebrows knotted together, and their lips are pulled down like they're genuinely annoyed or stressed, not smiling at all. They also keep their mouth shut during pauses, which feels a bit stiff, like they're forcing themselves not to say something. And their eyes keep darting sideways instead of meeting the person talking to them, which makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact because they're not comfortable with what they're saying.

But here's where I start second-guessing myself. That frown and the downward lip corners could just mean they're upset about the question itself—not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're frustrated with the topic or the person asking, not hiding anything. And the sideways glance? I've read that people look away for all sorts of reasons—maybe they're just thinking hard or it's a habit for them, not a sign of deception. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic "nervous" things like fidgeting, touching their face, or blinking a lot, which usually makes me lean toward "truthful" when I see those absent. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those signs, right? Like, if they were making it up, they might seem more tense overall.

The awkward pauses with their mouth closed feel like they're choosing words carefully, which could go either way—either they're being truthful but cautious, or they're trying to fabricate something. But honestly, without knowing what they're actually saying or the context, it's hard to pin down. I keep coming back to the fact that their discomfort seems genuine—like they're not acting, they're just... unhappy about the situation. That makes me lean toward "truthful," but I'm not totally sure. It's the kind of thing where if I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're being honest but stressed, though I can see how someone else might read that frown and sideways glance as a red flag. It’s not clear-cut at all.

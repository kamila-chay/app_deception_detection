Looking at the video, the person seems pretty engaged while talking—smiling a bit, nodding along, and keeping eye contact with whoever they're speaking to. They’re also tilting their head a little, which usually feels like they’re listening or thinking, not like they’re hiding something. Their eyes dart around a bit (gazing up, down, sideways), which I’ve noticed happens when people are just processing what they’re saying, not necessarily when they’re lying. But they’re blinking a lot, which sometimes makes me pause—I’ve heard that can be a sign of stress, which might mean they’re nervous about lying. Still, I’ve seen people blink a lot when they’re just tired or in a bright room, so it’s not a sure thing.  

The chin moving up and down is a bit unusual—I’ve never really seen that as a classic "lie" sign, but it’s not super common either. It feels more like they’re gesturing while they talk, maybe emphasizing points, rather than trying to hide something. And they’re not doing any of the obvious "tell" stuff—no lip biting, no covering their mouth, no avoiding eye contact. In fact, they’re leaning in a bit with the nodding and the head tilt, which usually feels more like someone being genuine.  

On the flip side, the raised eyebrows and the frequent blinking *could* point to some tension, but I’m not convinced. People raise eyebrows when they’re surprised or trying to seem interested, and blinking a lot doesn’t always mean deception—it’s just how some folks talk. Honestly, the smiling and the consistent eye contact (gazing toward the interlocutor the whole time) feel like stronger signs they’re being truthful. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of discomfort, like fidgeting or avoiding the gaze, but they’re not doing that.  

That said, I’m not 100% certain. Without knowing the context—like what they’re even talking about—it’s hard to say for sure. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive, or maybe they’re nervous for a totally innocent reason. But based on what I see, it seems more likely they’re telling the truth than lying. The behaviors feel too consistent with someone who’s just being themselves, not someone trying to pull something. I’d lean toward truth, but I’d want to hear the actual words before I’d feel completely solid about it.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them possibly not being entirely truthful. The way they keep raising their eyebrows while they're talking—like, really consistently, almost like they're trying to seem surprised or genuinely engaged—feels a bit off. And that frequent blinking, especially when they're answering questions directly? That's something I've noticed before when people are stressed or trying to think of something to say. It’s not like they're just nervous in general; it seems tied to their responses.  

But here's where I hesitate: they're keeping their palms up, facing the camera, and they're actually looking right at whoever's asking the questions. Those are usually signs of openness and honesty, right? Like, when people are being truthful, they often keep their hands visible and maintain eye contact to seem sincere. So maybe they're just really nervous about the situation—like maybe they're being questioned about something they're genuinely anxious about, not necessarily lying. I've seen people do that when they're scared of getting in trouble but actually telling the truth.  

Also, the way they're not smiling or frowning makes it harder to read them. If they were lying, I'd expect more "performance" like forced smiles or avoiding eye contact, but they're not doing that. It's almost like they're trying to be too neutral, which could be a sign of deception, but it could also just be them being extra careful. Honestly, the blinking and eyebrow thing is what sticks with me the most—it feels like micro-expressions they can't quite control. But I'm not ruling out that they're just a naturally expressive person or really stressed about the topic.  

So yeah, I'd say it's a maybe—deception is possible, but it's not a slam dunk. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward deception because of those subtle nervous cues, but I'd want more context to be sure. Like, what's the question they're answering? If it's something they'd genuinely be nervous about but not lying about, it could all just be stress. But as it stands, the signs are a little too consistent to ignore.

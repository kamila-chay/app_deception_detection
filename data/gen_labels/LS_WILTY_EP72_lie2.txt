Hmm, I'm watching this clip and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person seems pretty calm at first glance—they're not fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely, which I'd expect if they were lying. Like, they actually look at the person they're talking to a lot, which usually makes me think they're being honest. But then there's this thing where they keep raising their eyebrows—like, really noticeable, almost like they're trying to seem surprised or innocent. I've heard that can happen when people are lying, but I also know it's super common for people to raise their eyebrows naturally when they're thinking or reacting to something. 

And they shrug a few times, which feels more like they're unsure or just being casual, not necessarily deceptive. Like, shrugging usually means "I don't know" or "whatever," not "I'm lying." But then they also glance sideways a couple of times while talking, which I've seen in other clips where people seem a bit off. That part makes me pause because sideways glances can sometimes mean they're not fully engaged or trying to avoid the topic. 

On the flip side, they didn't smile or laugh at all, which I'd think might be a red flag if they were lying (since liars sometimes try to overcompensate with fake smiles), but here they're just... neutral. Like, they're not trying too hard to seem friendly. And no weird blinking or tense body language, which I'd expect if they were stressed about lying. So it's kind of confusing—some cues point to truth (eye contact, no fidgeting), and others point to deception (eyebrows, sideways looks). 

I think I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because the eye contact feels genuine, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person with those raised eyebrows, or maybe the sideways glances are just them thinking. Honestly, it's hard to say without knowing the context of what they're talking about. I'd probably say it's a maybe, but I'd hesitate to call it a lie.

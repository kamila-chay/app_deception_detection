I'm watching this clip, and while the person seems calm and maintains eye contact—which usually suggests honesty—there are a few subtle cues that make me lean toward the possibility they might be deceiving. For instance, the repeated eyebrow raises feel a bit exaggerated, almost as if they're trying to appear surprised or innocent, which can sometimes be a sign of dishonesty. Although eyebrow movements can be natural, in this context they seem somewhat deliberate.

Additionally, the sideways glances caught my attention. They glance away a couple of times, which could indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid fully engaging with the topic. That kind of behavior can be a red flag, even if they're otherwise composed. The shrugging seems casual, maybe expressing uncertainty, but paired with the other cues it adds to my suspicion.

On the other hand, the lack of any forced smiles or overt signs of stress—like tense body language or excessive blinking—doesn't strongly support the idea that they're lying. It's a bit ambiguous. Some things point toward truthfulness, but these minor signals, especially the eyebrow raises and sideways looks, make me lean slightly toward thinking they might not be entirely honest. I wouldn’t say for sure they’re lying, but my gut feeling is tilting that way.

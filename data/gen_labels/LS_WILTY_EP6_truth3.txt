Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly? It's a bit hard to tell. The person seems pretty calm while answering the question—I notice they're actually smiling a little, like their lips are pulled up at the corners, and they're looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which feels like they're engaged. They're also shrugging once, which usually means "I don't know" or "it's not my fault," not something you'd do if you were trying to cover up a lie. But then there's the head shaking—they shake their head once while they're talking, and that part makes me pause for a second. Sometimes people shake their heads when they're denying something, so I wondered if that was a red flag.  

But here's why I'm not totally sure: head shaking can just be a nervous habit or even a way to emphasize "no" in a conversation, not necessarily deception. Like, if they're saying "no, I didn't do it," the head shake might just be natural. And the shrug—they didn't seem defensive, just kind of... relaxed, like they're being straightforward. They also kept their gaze on the person asking, which feels more like honesty than hiding. I mean, when people lie, they often look away or fidget, but here they're looking down sometimes, which could just be shyness or thinking, not guilt.  

The thing is, the smile is a bit confusing—sometimes people fake smiles when lying, but this one looks soft, not forced. Like, they're not grinning like they're hiding something. And no weird blinking or touching their face, which are other classic "lying" cues. But yeah, I know those signs aren't foolproof. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person.  

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth because everything feels... unforced? The shrug and the smile don't scream "deception" to me, even with the head shake. But I'm not 100% sure—like, maybe the head shake was a mistake in context, or maybe I'm just reading too much into it. It's hard to tell from just a clip, especially without knowing the question they're answering. If I had to guess, though, I'd say they're being honest. But I'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure.

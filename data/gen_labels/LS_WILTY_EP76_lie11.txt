Honestly, this one's a bit tricky for me to call. I'm watching the clip, and the main thing that stands out is that the person keeps looking straight up—like they're staring at the ceiling or imagining something. Now, I know some people say looking up is a sign of lying because it's how you "fabricate" things in your head, but I've also heard that it's actually more common when people are trying to *remember* something accurately, which would lean toward truth-telling. Since they're not fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or showing any of those classic "nervous liar" signs like blinking a lot or touching their face, it feels... off-kilter. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of stress, but there's nothing.  

That said, it's possible they're just really good at hiding it. Maybe they've practiced lying before, so they don't show any tells. Or maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure, which wouldn't mean they're truthful—it could just mean they're skilled at deception. The fact that they're not looking at the person they're talking to (gaze up instead of toward the interlocutor) is a bit suspicious, but I've seen people do that when they're deep in thought, whether they're recalling a real memory or making something up.  

What really throws me is how *empty* the rest of the behavior is. No raised eyebrows, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles—just this steady upward gaze. Normally, if someone's lying, even a little, you'd catch *some* micro-expression or shift. But here, it's like they're in a neutral zone. I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just because the absence of tension feels more authentic to me—truth-tellers can be calm too. But I'm not 100% sure. It's not impossible they're lying and just happen to be a very composed liar. Honestly, without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—I'd have to say it's a maybe. I'd probably ask for more info before I'd feel confident either way.

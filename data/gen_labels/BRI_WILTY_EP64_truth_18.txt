Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out just by watching the clip, and it's a bit tricky. The person doesn't seem to be smiling or laughing, which I guess you'd expect if they were relaxed or telling a joke, but they also don't have that classic "nervous" look like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. Their eyebrows are raised and they're frowning at the same time—kind of a confused or skeptical look—and their eyes are looking up, not at the person they're talking to. 

I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but here they're not looking away, they're looking up, which some think means they're thinking hard, not necessarily lying. The frown and raised brows might just mean they're processing what they're saying or disagreeing with something, not that they're being deceptive. I don't see any signs of stress like rapid blinking, lip biting, or hands covering their face, which I've noticed in other videos where people seemed anxious. 

But then again, I'm not an expert—maybe the frown is a sign of lying for some people? I've also read that some liars can look very calm, so the lack of obvious nervousness might not mean anything. And the gaze up... I know some cultures interpret that as dishonest, but I'm not sure if that's actually reliable. It could just be them recalling something. 

Honestly, it feels like they're being straightforward because their body language doesn't scream "I'm hiding something," but I can't rule out that they're just good at hiding it. The way they're speaking doesn't seem forced, and there's no awkward pause. So yeah, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what I'm seeing, it doesn't *feel* like lying to me.

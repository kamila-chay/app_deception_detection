Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the video alone, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person seems to be looking right at whoever they're talking to, which feels like they're trying to connect—liars sometimes avoid eye contact, but not always, so that doesn't really point one way or the other. Their eyebrows are raised, and they're blinking a lot, which could be nerves, but it could also just be them thinking hard or being a bit excited. I noticed their lip corners are slightly up, like they're trying to smile, but not a full smile—so maybe they're being polite or genuinely engaged, not necessarily hiding something.  

The head tilting is interesting—it often feels like someone is listening or processing, which fits with someone telling a story they believe. And they're touching their head or face a few times, but not covering their mouth or anything that screams "I'm lying." Honestly, the lack of other classic "stress" signs—like frowning, crossing arms, or avoiding gaze—makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect more tension in their face or body, like tight lips or stiff posture, but it all seems pretty relaxed.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Frequent blinking *can* happen when people are lying, especially if they're trying to control their expression. And raised eyebrows sometimes show skepticism, but here it might just be them reacting to the question. I've also seen people who are really good at hiding their lies—maybe they're not nervous at all. But the way they're holding eye contact and the subtle smile (even if it's not full) feels more like someone being genuine than someone rehearsing a lie.  

At the end of the day, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, it feels more like they're telling the truth. It’s not a smoking gun, but the absence of obvious deception cues makes it harder to believe they're lying. Still, without hearing what they're actually saying, it’s all just a guess—people can seem calm while lying, and nervous while telling the truth. I’d probably need more context to feel confident, but right now, I’d lean toward truth.

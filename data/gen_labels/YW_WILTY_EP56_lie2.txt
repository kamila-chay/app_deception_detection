Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not sure. The person seems to be looking right at the person they're talking to, which usually feels like someone being engaged or honest—but then their eyes keep darting up, which I've heard people say sometimes happens when they're trying to recall something or make something up. And their hands are constantly rubbing together, like they're really nervous or trying to calm themselves down. That rubbing feels like a classic sign of stress, which could point to deception, especially since they're not smiling or laughing at all—those usually come up when people are relaxed or being playful.

But wait, I should consider other angles too. Maybe they're just naturally fidgety, or maybe they're cold and rubbing their hands to warm up. The gaze up could just mean they're concentrating hard on what they're saying, not necessarily lying—like when you're trying to remember a detail. And they're not avoiding eye contact or acting overly stiff, which sometimes happens with liars. Honestly, it's a toss-up. The hands rubbing is the strongest clue I see, but it's not definitive. I'd lean toward deception just because of that nervous gesture combined with the gaze shift, but I could totally be wrong. Like, maybe they're just really anxious about the situation, not lying about anything specific. I'd want to see more context before I'd be confident either way.

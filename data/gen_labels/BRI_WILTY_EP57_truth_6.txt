Hmm, looking at this video clip, I'm trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't super clear-cut. What stands out to me is that they're actually making eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time—like, they're not avoiding it completely, which usually makes me lean toward them being honest. But then they keep glancing sideways a bit, which sometimes happens when people are thinking or trying to recall details, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're just distracted by something in the room or just naturally shift their gaze when speaking.

On the other hand, their lips are pulled back a little—like a slight grimace or tension—without smiling or frowning. I've heard that when people are stressed or lying, they might do things like that, but I've also seen people do it when they're just concentrating hard, especially if they're nervous about the conversation. And they're not fidgeting at all—no blinking a lot, no hands moving around, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed. That part feels like it leans toward truth because liars often show more physical signs of stress. But then again, some really practiced liars don't show those signs, so it's not a guarantee.

The sideways glances are making me second-guess a bit. If they were lying, I might expect them to avoid eye contact more, but they're still mostly looking at the person, just with those little side looks. Maybe they're just a bit uncomfortable but not deceptive. Or maybe the sideways glance is just how they naturally talk, like they're thinking while they speak. I don't know the context—like, are they being asked something sensitive?—so that could change things. Without more to go on, I'd probably say it feels more like they're telling the truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those cases where the behavior doesn't scream "liar," but it also doesn't scream "truth" either. Just... neutral with a slight tilt toward honest, based on the lack of obvious nervousness. But honestly, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure.

Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one. Watching the clip, the person seems to be really engaged—they're making steady eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which usually feels more natural when someone's being truthful. But then there's that exaggerated eye closing when they're answering, like they're really squinting or shutting their eyes tight for a second. I've seen that before in people who might be trying to "remember" something, but honestly, it could just be a nervous habit or them genuinely thinking hard about the question.  

The raised eyebrows and head tilting feel like they're processing what's being said, not necessarily hiding something. Head tilting is super common when people are listening carefully—it's not like they're avoiding eye contact or fidgeting a lot. And they're touching their head with their hand a couple times, which I've noticed happens to everyone when they're trying to recall details, whether they're lying or not.  

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes when people are lying, they overdo expressions to seem sincere—like that exaggerated eye closing might be an attempt to "look thoughtful" when they're actually fabricating. And the raised eyebrows could read as skepticism, like they're doubting themselves, which might hint at guilt. Still, the lack of other classic signs—no forced smiles, no fidgeting with hands, no avoiding eye contact—makes it feel less like deception.  

I guess my gut says they're probably telling the truth because the behaviors seem more like genuine concentration than the "performance" of lying. But I'm not 100% sure—people can be really good at hiding things, and sometimes natural reactions get misread. It’s the kind of thing where if I heard the actual words they were saying, it might be clearer. For now, I’d lean toward truth, but I’d want to see more context before I’d feel confident.

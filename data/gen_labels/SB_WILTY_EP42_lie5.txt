Looking at the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying, but there are a few things that make me lean toward it being deception. The most noticeable thing is how often they're blinking—way more than normal, like they're trying to avoid eye contact or just really nervous. And their chin keeps moving up and down, almost like they're swallowing something or fidgeting without realizing it. They're also nodding and leaning forward while looking directly at the person they're talking to, which is a bit confusing because I've heard that liars sometimes *do* maintain eye contact to seem honest, but it's not a sure sign. The way they're moving their head forward and nodding could also just be them being engaged, though.

But here's why I'm not totally convinced: the lack of other classic "lying" cues is weird. No frowning, no fake smiles, no awkward pauses or lip movements. If they were really lying, I'd expect more signs of discomfort—like avoiding eye contact or looking away more, but they're actually holding steady eye contact. That makes me wonder if the blinking is just from dry eyes or the camera light, not deception. Also, the chin movements could be a nervous habit unrelated to lying, like how some people tap their fingers when they're thinking. And the fact that they're nodding along while talking might just mean they're trying to seem cooperative, not necessarily deceptive.

Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure. The blinking stands out, but it's not enough on its own, and the other behaviors don't really add up to a clear "lie." I'd probably need more context—like what they're saying or if there's a reason they'd be stressed—to feel confident. Right now, I'm just guessing it *might* be deception because of the blinking, but I could easily be wrong. It feels like they're just a little tense, not necessarily lying.

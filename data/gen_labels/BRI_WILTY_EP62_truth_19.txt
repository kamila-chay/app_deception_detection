Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because they just seem... calm. Like, really calm. They're sitting there, speaking clearly, no fidgeting, no shifting in their seat, and definitely no nervous gestures—no hand rubbing, no avoiding eye contact, nothing. Their face is pretty neutral too, not smiling or scowling, just steady. If I were going by the usual "lie signs" people talk about—like excessive blinking, fidgeting, or looking away—they're not doing any of that. That *does* lean toward them being truthful, because if they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of stress, right? But then I remember: some people are just naturally this composed, especially if they're used to being on camera or if they're really good at hiding their nerves. Like, I've seen people lie while looking completely relaxed—maybe they've practiced it or they're just not the type to show stress.  

Also, the way they're speaking feels consistent, not rushed or overly rehearsed. But wait, that could also be part of a good lie—some liars sound *too* smooth. And honestly, without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to tell. Maybe they're just a calm person, or maybe they're just really good at covering up. I mean, the absence of tells isn't proof of truth—it's just not proof of lying. It's like when someone says, "I'm not nervous," and they're not sweating or shaking, but that doesn't mean they're not lying. They could be hiding it well.  

So yeah, I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because they're not showing any of those classic stress cues, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's possible they're lying and just happen to be the type who stays cool under pressure. I guess the safest thing to say is... I don't *know*, but based on what I see, it feels more like they're being honest than not. But I'd need more to be sure—like, what they're actually saying or if there's any contradiction in their story. Without that, it's just a gut feeling, not a certainty.

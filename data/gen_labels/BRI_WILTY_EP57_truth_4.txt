Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I wouldn't bet the farm on it. They're keeping pretty steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels more natural when someone's being genuine. And they're nodding along a few times, like they're genuinely engaged in the conversation rather than trying to fake it. I also noticed they'd glance up a bit, like when they're thinking or recalling something, which I've heard some people say happens more when people are being truthful—though I've also heard the opposite, so that part's tricky.  

That said, I can see why someone might think they're lying. Nodding can sometimes be a nervous habit, even when people are being honest, and eye contact isn't always a perfect tell—some folks just naturally look at people when they talk, whether they're lying or not. And honestly, the video doesn't show much else to go on: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no obvious signs of stress like avoiding eye contact or covering their mouth. But absence of tells doesn't *prove* truth either—some liars are really good at staying calm.  

I guess what's making me lean truth is that all the little things they're doing seem… consistent. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect them to maybe glance away more or seem a little stiff. But here, they're just talking normally, looking at the other person, nodding like it's a real conversation. It feels like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. Still, I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be sure—without context, it's hard to say for sure. But based on the behavior alone, I'd say it's more likely truth than not, though I'd keep an open mind.

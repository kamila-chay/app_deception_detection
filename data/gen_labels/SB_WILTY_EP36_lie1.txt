Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful. The frequent blinking is noticeably above normal, almost as if they’re struggling to maintain focus, which can be a subtle sign of discomfort linked to deception. Their head movements—tilting, turning sideways, and the slight chin dip—give the impression of someone trying to withdraw or shrink away, possibly indicating unease or an attempt to mask their true feelings. Their eyes frequently dart upwards and sideways instead of staying connected with the person they're speaking to, which often suggests someone is searching for fabricated details or avoiding direct interaction.

While they don’t show the forced smiles or overt facial expressions sometimes associated with lying, their neutral expression paired with these other behaviors feels like a controlled effort to appear calm, maybe to cover up their discomfort. The way they hold their head up tries to project confidence, but the contradictory sideways glances and chin movements hint at underlying stress or deception. Although some of these behaviors could be explained by nervousness or fatigue, the consistent avoidance of eye contact and fidgety head movements make me inclined to suspect they may be withholding the truth. I wouldn’t say this is certain, as people can behave similarly for many reasons, but given the cues, I tend to think deception is more likely than not here.

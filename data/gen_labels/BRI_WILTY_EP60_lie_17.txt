Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky without knowing the context of what they're being asked about. From what I can see, they're doing a few things that make me lean toward deception, but I'm not totally sure.

First off, they've got those eyebrows going—frowning *and* raising them at the same time. That combination feels off to me. Usually, frowning shows tension or negativity, but raising eyebrows often means surprise or skepticism. It's like they're caught between being annoyed and trying to seem surprised, which sometimes happens when people are trying to cover something up. Then there's the gaze—sometimes they're looking right at the person asking the question, but other times they're glancing sideways. That shifting gaze feels like they're not fully engaged or maybe avoiding direct eye contact, which a lot of people associate with lying. Like, if you're trying to remember a lie, you might look away to think, or maybe you're just nervous.

But here's where I hesitate: I've seen people frown and raise their eyebrows when they're just really concentrating on a hard question, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're frustrated with how the question is phrased, or they're genuinely trying to recall something. And the sideways glance? Could be cultural—some people naturally look away when they're thinking, even when they're being honest. I've heard that in some cultures, direct eye contact is seen as rude, so that sideways look might just be normal for them. Also, they're maintaining some eye contact overall, which makes me think they're not *completely* avoiding the person, which sometimes happens when someone's trying to be extra convincing.

The thing that sticks with me is the tension in their face—those frowning eyebrows aren't relaxed, and the raised ones feel forced. It doesn't look natural, like they're holding themselves in a way that's not comfortable. But again, stress from being filmed or just being asked a tough question could cause that. I'm not ruling out truthfulness, but it's making me lean toward deception. Still, I'd want to see more—like the actual question they're answering or their tone of voice—before I'd feel confident. It's one of those cases where the behavior *suggests* something, but it's not definitive. I'd say it's a maybe, leaning toward lying, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to misread these things without more context.

Looking closely at this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be telling the truth, though I can't be entirely certain. Their facial expressions are somewhat contradictory—frowning and raising their eyebrows simultaneously—which seems unusual. Typically, frowning signals tension or negativity, while raised eyebrows suggest surprise or skepticism, so this mix feels like they might be trying to mask something. Additionally, their gaze shifts between direct eye contact and sidelong glances, which often indicates discomfort or an attempt to avoid full engagement, behaviors commonly linked to deception.

That said, it's important to consider that people can frown and raise their eyebrows when concentrating hard or feeling frustrated, and some cultures view direct eye contact differently, meaning the sideways glances might not be suspicious in every context. They do maintain some level of eye contact, which could suggest they’re not entirely closed off, possibly indicating they want to appear honest.

Still, the overall tension in their facial muscles—the combination of the frown and the seemingly forced raised eyebrows—doesn't appear natural and could point to discomfort arising from hiding something. While I can't definitively say they're lying, these cues make me somewhat doubtful about their truthfulness. More context, such as the question being asked or their tone, would be necessary to feel more confident. For now, I’m inclined to suspect deception, but cautiously so.

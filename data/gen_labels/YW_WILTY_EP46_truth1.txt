Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful, but honestly, it's really tough to say for sure. What stands out to me is how they're looking right at the camera the whole time—steady eye contact, no darting around or avoiding it. That usually makes me lean toward them being honest, since people who are lying often get nervous and look away. But I know that's not always true; some liars actually practice keeping eye contact to seem more convincing, so I can't rule that out.  

Their body language seems open too—arms are relaxed and spread out, not crossed or tense, which feels like they're not hiding anything. And they're not fidgeting at all: no hand-rubbing, no awkward pauses, no weird lip movements. That’s a good sign for truthfulness, but again, I’ve heard that skilled liars can control their body language too, so it’s not foolproof.  

The one thing that made me pause was those raised eyebrows—like they’re genuinely surprised or processing something. If they were lying, I’d expect more signs of stress, like frowning or blinking a lot, but they’re not doing any of that. It feels more like they’re just reacting naturally to what they’re saying. Still, raised eyebrows can sometimes mean confusion or even deception in certain contexts, so I’m not 100% sure.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, why would they look so calm and engaged? Most people who’re making things up seem a bit more on edge, even if they try to hide it. The lack of nervous ticks makes me think they’re not rehearsing or hiding something. But yeah, I keep second-guessing because I’ve seen so many videos where people *look* honest but are lying through their teeth.  

Honestly, I’d probably lean toward truth here, but I’m not confident. It’s like they’re just telling a story without any of the "tells" I’ve heard about, and that’s pretty rare if they’re lying. Still, without knowing the context—like what they’re even talking about—it’s hard to say. Maybe they’re just a naturally calm person. I’d say it’s more likely truth, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.

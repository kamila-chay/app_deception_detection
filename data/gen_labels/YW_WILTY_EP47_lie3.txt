Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful here. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the cues aren't super obvious. What stands out to me is how they keep tilting their head to the side a little while speaking—like they're really listening or thinking hard about what to say. Their eyebrows are raised a lot too, which sometimes feels like someone trying to seem extra engaged or maybe a bit nervous. But then their hands are open, palms up, and arms are relaxed and spread out, which usually makes me think someone's being genuine—like they're not hiding anything. And they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels like they're trying to connect, not avoid eye contact.

On the other hand, I keep wondering if that head tilt and raised eyebrows are actually signs of deception. I've heard some people say that when people lie, they might do little things like that to seem more sincere or to buy time while they're making up a story. And yeah, they're looking down sometimes too—like when they're not sure how to answer. But I know looking down can also just mean someone's shy or just thinking, not necessarily lying. The fact that they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, and not crossing their arms makes me lean toward them being honest, but I'm not 100% sure. 

The open palms and arms are really making me second-guess the deception label though. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous gestures—like fiddling with their hands or looking away more. But here, everything feels kind of calm and deliberate. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows and head movements, not trying to hide anything. I guess I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I can see how someone else might read those subtle cues as suspicious. It's not a clear-cut case—just feels like they're being a little extra attentive, which could go either way.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing. They're definitely making eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels a bit unusual if they were being deceptive—most people who lie tend to avoid direct eye contact or look away more. Instead, they're glancing down and sideways a lot, which could mean they're thinking carefully about what they're saying, or maybe just naturally shifting their gaze while speaking. 

The head movements stand out to me—tilting, moving forward and backward, and shaking their head a bit. I've heard that excessive head movement can sometimes signal discomfort or uncertainty, which *might* hint at lying, but I'm not convinced. A lot of people do that when they're just being expressive or nervous about talking, not necessarily when they're hiding something. They're also touching their head/face a few times, which people often do when they're stressed or trying to think, but again, that's super common and not a reliable sign of deception. 

On the flip side, there's no real "classic" lying behavior here—no frowning, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles or laughing. They seem pretty calm overall. If they *were* lying, I'd expect more signs of anxiety, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting with their hands, but they're not doing that. The raised eyebrows feel like they might be reacting to something the other person said, not trying to cover up a lie. 

I guess the thing that keeps me leaning toward "truth" is that their behavior seems consistent with someone who's just being thoughtful or maybe a bit hesitant, not someone trying to pull a fast one. But I'm really not certain—people act differently when they're stressed, and this could just be their normal way of speaking. I'd need way more context to be confident, but based on the video alone, it doesn't *feel* like they're lying. It just feels like someone who's taking their time to answer.

Looking at the clip, I'm leaning slightly toward the idea that the person might be lying, although it's not entirely clear. They maintain steady eye contact, which some believe suggests honesty, but it can also be a tactic used by liars trying to appear trustworthy. Their nodding seems to show agreement or understanding, which typically wouldn’t be expected if they were outright hiding something, but again, it could be part of an act. The most notable factor is their frequent blinking—significantly more than usual—which often indicates stress or discomfort. While this could be due to tiredness or irritation, frequent blinking is known to sometimes correlate with deception. They don’t display other common signs of lying like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, so it’s possible the blinking is unrelated. Still, given the combination of steady yet potentially overdone eye contact, the nodding, and the excessive blinking, I tend to suspect there might be some level of deception involved. However, I wouldn’t say this with full confidence and would want more context to be sure.

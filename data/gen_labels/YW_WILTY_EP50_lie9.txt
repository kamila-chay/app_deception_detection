Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone answering a question, and honestly, the thing that stands out most is how steady their eye contact is—like, they're really looking right at the person asking, no shifting away. And their hands are open, palms up, which usually feels like someone trying to seem sincere or open, not hiding anything. That makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, at least in this moment. I mean, if they were lying, I'd expect maybe more fidgeting or avoiding eyes, but there's none of that—no nervous blinking, no crossed arms, nothing. They seem calm and engaged.

But then again, I know some people who lie really well and deliberately keep eye contact to seem confident, and palms up could even be a way to fake that "I'm being honest" vibe. Maybe they're just naturally calm under pressure, or maybe they're rehearsed, so it doesn't look like they're struggling. Like, I've seen people who are good at this act—like, they don't even realize they're being deceptive because they've practiced it so much. And honestly, without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to tell if they're nervous about the question itself, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just uncomfortable talking about something personal, not that they're making it up.

So yeah, I'm not 100% sure. The cues *feel* more like truthfulness—steady gaze, open hands—but I also know how easy it is to misread that. It's not like they're sweating or avoiding the question, which would be a bigger red flag for lying. But then again, the absence of "tells" isn't proof of truth either. I guess I'd say it's more likely they're being honest, but I'd want to hear the actual question and answer before I'd feel confident about it. Like, if they're saying something that's clearly false, even calm people might slip up, but here it just seems... quiet. Too quiet, maybe? I don't know. It's one of those cases where the lack of obvious signs could go either way.

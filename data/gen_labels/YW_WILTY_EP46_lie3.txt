While I can't be completely certain, I tend to lean toward the idea that this person might not be entirely truthful based on their behavior. They frequently look down and sideways while speaking, even though they do make some eye contact—this inconsistent gaze strikes me as a potential sign of discomfort or evasion. Typically, when someone is relaxed and honest, their eye contact is steadier, so this repeated shifting feels a bit off. Additionally, their constant touching of their head or face, like adjusting their hair or rubbing their temple, aligns with classic nervous gestures often associated with stress about what’s being said.

That said, it’s possible these behaviors stem from natural fidgetiness, nervousness, or fatigue, which complicates drawing any firm conclusions. The palms being up usually signal openness and honesty, somewhat contradicting the nervous cues. Their neutral expression—neither smiling nor frowning—also muddies the waters, since people lying sometimes maintain a calm façade, making it ambiguous.

Overall, the blend of intermittent eye contact and restless hand movements suggests to me that they might be trying to appear engaged but are unsettled underneath. While I wouldn’t be fully confident calling it deception, and more context would be necessary for a definite judgment, these signs do incline me to suspect that they might not be telling the whole truth.

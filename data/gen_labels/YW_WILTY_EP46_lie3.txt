Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them not being entirely truthful based on what I'm seeing. They keep looking down and sideways while talking, even though they're making some eye contact with the other person—that feels a bit off. Like, when people are relaxed or telling the truth, they tend to hold eye contact more consistently, but here they're shifting their gaze a lot, almost like they're avoiding really locking eyes. And their hands are constantly touching their head or face—reaching up to adjust their hair or rub their temple? That's a classic nervous gesture I've seen before when someone's stressed about what they're saying.  

But I'm really not certain, because it could just be them being naturally fidgety or anxious about the situation. Maybe they're just tired or thinking hard about their answer, and the head-touching isn't about lying at all. The palms being up is usually a sign of openness or honesty, which kinda contradicts the other signs. And they're not smiling or frowning, which makes it harder to read—sometimes people who lie *do* try to seem calm, so not showing obvious emotions could go either way.  

I think the biggest thing is that mix of "looking at the person but not really holding it" plus the hand movements. It feels like they're trying to seem engaged but can't quite settle. But honestly, without knowing what they're talking about or if they're just a nervous person, it's really hard to say for sure. I'd be more confident if they'd been avoiding eye contact completely or had that stiff, fake smile, but this feels like maybe they're just uncomfortable, not necessarily lying. Still, the combination of the gaze shifts and the hand gestures makes me wonder if there's something they're not saying. It’s tricky, though—I’d need more context to feel like I had it figured out.

Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, it doesn't seem like they're lying. The person is consistently looking directly at whoever they're talking to—like, their eyes are locked on the other person the whole time—and they're nodding along as if they're genuinely following the conversation. That kind of steady eye contact and natural nodding usually feels more like someone who's engaged and truthful, not someone trying to hide something. I also notice they're moving their chin slightly upward when they're speaking, which isn't a nervous tic or a forced expression—it just looks like a subtle way of emphasizing agreement, like "yeah, that's right." 

But I can see why someone might question it. If they were lying, you'd expect more tells, right? Like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or that stiff "fake smile" people sometimes do when they're being deceptive. Here, though, they're not doing any of that. Their mouth is just closed normally, no awkward pauses, and no signs of tension in their face or hands. It all feels... calm. Like they're just calmly answering a straightforward question. 

That said, I guess you could argue that the chin movement *could* be a little odd—maybe they're trying to seem more confident? But honestly, that feels like stretching it. Most people don't consciously move their chin like that when they're telling the truth, so it's probably just a natural part of their speech. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact or over-nodding (which sometimes happens when people are nervous) makes me lean toward them being genuine. 

I'm not saying I'd bet my life on it, but based on what's happening in the clip, it just doesn't *feel* like deception. It feels like someone who's being straightforward. The absence of all those classic "lying" cues—like fidgeting, forced smiles, or looking away—makes the truth label seem plausible. If I had to guess without knowing the label, I'd say they're probably telling the truth.

Looking at the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not, but I'll try to break it down. They're not smiling or laughing, which is interesting because liars sometimes force smiles to seem friendly, but they're also not frowning or looking away much—those are common deception cues. Instead, they keep raising their eyebrows a few times, and their gaze is mostly looking up, not at me. I've heard that people often look up when they're trying to recall something from memory, which usually happens when they're being truthful. Like, if someone's asking about a past event, they might glance up to "think," whereas liars might look down or avoid eye contact to avoid being caught. 

But then there's the shrug—they shrug once or twice, which is tricky. Shrug can mean "I don't know" or "I'm not sure," which might be honest, but it could also be a way to seem casual while lying. I'm not sure if that's a red flag here. And honestly, they don't seem stressed at all—no fidgeting, no lip biting, no rapid blinking. Liars often have those nervous habits, so the lack of them makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I know some people can lie really smoothly without showing stress, so it's not a guarantee. 

On the flip side, maybe the eyebrow raises are fake—they look a bit exaggerated, like they're trying to seem surprised to cover something up. And the upward gaze... well, I've heard some people say liars *also* look up when they're making things up, so it's not a perfect sign. But the fact that they're not doing *anything* else that screams "deception" (like avoiding eye contact or covering their mouth) makes me think it's less likely they're lying. I'm still not 100% sure, though—human behavior is messy. But based on what I see, I'd guess they're telling the truth, just because the cues don't add up to a classic lie. It's not a slam dunk, but it's the most plausible thing I'm seeing.

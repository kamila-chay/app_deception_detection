Honestly, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tough to tell just from watching, and I know people can get nervous for all sorts of reasons. What stood out to me was how they kept furrowing their eyebrows like they were really concentrating or stressed, and their eyes kept darting down and sideways a few times. That *does* make me lean toward thinking maybe they're not being completely straightforward, because when people are lying, they often seem tense or avoid direct eye contact. But then, they also had this head tilt thing, like they were genuinely trying to listen or figure something out, and their eyebrows were raised a bit too—like they were surprised by the question, not hiding something. That part feels confusing because raised eyebrows usually don't match deception; they're more like "huh, I didn't expect that" energy.  

Also, their gaze stayed mostly on the camera when they were talking, which is actually a sign of honesty in some contexts—liars sometimes look away more. But I've heard that looking down can also mean they're processing or feeling embarrassed, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just really anxious about the situation, like they're worried about getting it wrong or they're not used to being on camera. I mean, I've definitely been in spots where I frown and look away because I'm stressed about answering something, not because I'm lying.  

So yeah, I'm stuck between two ideas: the frown and the shifting eyes *could* point to deception, but the head tilt and the way they were engaging with the camera feels more like someone who's just trying hard to be honest but is nervous. It's really hard to say for sure without knowing the context—like, what were they even talking about? If it was something super personal or high-pressure, the stress might explain it all. I'd say it's a maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it either way. Definitely not 100% convinced they're lying, but I can't rule it out either.

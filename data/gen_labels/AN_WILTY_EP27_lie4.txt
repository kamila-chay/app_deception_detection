Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece this together. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—which usually makes me lean toward them being truthful, since liars often avoid direct gaze. But they're also looking down quite a bit while doing it, which is a bit confusing. I've heard that people sometimes look down when they're being honest, like when they're thinking carefully about their answer, but it could also be a sign they're trying to hide something. Their chin is moving upward a little, like they're lifting it slightly when they speak—maybe that's confidence, or maybe it's just a nervous habit. Honestly, it's hard to tell.  

The thing that sticks out is their fingers crossed. I've seen people do that when they're stressed or trying to "cross their fingers" for luck, but I've also read that it's not a reliable sign of lying—it might just be a tic. Like, maybe they're just restless, not necessarily deceptive. And they're not doing any of the obvious tells: no frowning, no weird blinking, no awkward pauses where they're trying to think of words. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those signs, but there's almost nothing.  

On the flip side, though, crossing fingers *is* something people sometimes do when they're not being truthful, so I can't completely rule it out. But I keep coming back to the eye contact—they're looking right at the person, not darting around, which feels more like someone who's trying to be convincing than someone hiding something. Maybe they're just a little nervous, but that doesn't mean they're lying.  

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. It's a close call, and without more context—like what they're being asked about or the tone of the conversation—it's really hard to pin down. I'd lean toward them being truthful because of the consistent eye contact and lack of other red flags, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. The crossed fingers is nagging at me, but I think it's probably overthinking it. Maybe they just do that when they're talking. So yeah, I'm leaning "truth" but with a lot of "could be wrong" attached.

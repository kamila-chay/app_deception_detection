Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece this together. The person is making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which often suggests truthfulness since liars tend to avoid direct gaze. However, they're also looking down quite a bit while speaking, which complicates things. While some say people look down when being honest as they think carefully, it can also indicate they're trying to hide something. Their chin moves upward slightly, which might be confidence or just a nervous tic—it's hard to be sure.  

What stands out most is their fingers crossed. Although some argue this could be a harmless habit or a sign of stress, it's also a common gesture associated with deception, as people "cross their fingers" hoping their lie will be believed. They aren't showing obvious signs like frowning, awkward pauses, or unusual blinking, which often accompany lying. But the absence of those signs doesn't necessarily mean they're telling the truth.  

Even though they maintain steady eye contact—which often points to honesty—it could also be an attempt to appear convincing and mask deceit. The crossed fingers gesture nags at me; it feels like a subtle clue they might be trying to deceive. Without knowing the context or tone of the conversation, it's difficult to say for certain, but given these mixed signals, I lean toward the possibility that the person is not being entirely truthful. It's not definitive, but there’s enough for me to suspect some level of deception.

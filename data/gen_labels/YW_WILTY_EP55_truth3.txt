Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure, but here's how I'm thinking about it. The person is talking to someone else, and they keep making eye contact—looking right at the person they're talking to, not glancing away or down. That's one thing that stands out. Usually, when people are lying, they might avoid eye contact or look around a lot, but this person seems to be holding it pretty steady. They also have their eyebrows raised a bit, like they're genuinely interested or maybe a little surprised by what they're saying, which doesn't feel like the kind of nervousness I'd expect from someone trying to cover up something.  

But then I'm second-guessing myself because I've heard that some people who lie can actually look you in the eye to seem more convincing—they might practice that. So maybe the steady gaze isn't a sure sign of truth. And the eyebrows raised... well, that could just be their natural way of talking, like they're emphasizing something, not necessarily a clue about honesty. I mean, I've seen people do that when they're being truthful too, so it's not like it's a "tell" for lying.  

What really makes me lean toward them not lying is that they don't seem stressed or fidgety at all. No weird blinking, no covering their mouth, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck. They're just speaking normally, like they're comfortable with what they're saying. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little sign of tension—maybe a forced smile or avoiding eye contact—but there's nothing like that here. It just feels... calm.  

But yeah, I can't rule out the possibility they're just really good at hiding it. Some people don't show the classic "lying" cues at all, especially if they're practiced or just not nervous. And honestly, it's hard to tell without knowing the context—like, what are they even talking about? If it's something they're really sure about, they'd probably act like this even if they were telling the truth.  

So, all in all, I don't see any red flags that make me think they're lying. The behavior seems consistent with someone being straightforward, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like they're being honest, but I'm not 100% certain—there's just not enough to go on to say for sure. I'd probably say they're not lying, but I'd want more info before I'd feel confident.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit tricky to call. The person is sitting with their arms folded, which I guess could look a little defensive at first glance—like they're shutting themselves off or trying to hide something. But what stands out more is that they're actually holding steady eye contact the whole time, looking right at the camera (or whoever they're talking to), and not fidgeting or avoiding the gaze at all. I've heard that when people lie, they often look away or seem distracted, but here they're locked in, which feels more like someone being straightforward.  

That said, I know arms folded isn't always a clear sign of deception—it could just be their natural posture, like they're comfortable or even just cold. And honestly, some people who lie *do* try to look calm and make eye contact to seem believable, so it's not foolproof. If I were to guess, I'd lean toward them telling the truth because the lack of nervous ticks (no blinking, no shifting, no awkward pauses) seems to line up more with someone being relaxed and honest. But I'm not totally sure—I mean, maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe the folded arms are a subtle cue I'm missing. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

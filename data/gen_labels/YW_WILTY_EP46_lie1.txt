Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it’s a bit complicated to make a definitive judgment, but I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive. Their arms are folded, which can sometimes be a defensive gesture, potentially indicating they’re shutting down or hiding something. While it’s notable that they maintain steady eye contact without fidgeting or looking away—which is often interpreted as a sign of honesty—this could also be a deliberate effort to appear convincing. People who lie sometimes try to maintain calm and steady eye contact to avoid suspicion, so this alone isn't a clear indicator of truthfulness.

The folded arms could simply be their natural posture or a sign of discomfort, but taken together with the other cues, there seems to be a subtle disconnect. The absence of nervous ticks might suggest control rather than genuine relaxation, as some liars are skilled at masking typical signs of deceit. Without knowing the full context, I can’t say for certain, but overall, I tend to suspect that the person might not be entirely truthful here.

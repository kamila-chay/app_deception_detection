Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I can't say for sure. They were laughing naturally when they mentioned the part about the project deadline, and it didn't feel forced—like it was a genuine reaction to something they remembered. Their eyebrows were raised a few times too, which often happens when people are being expressive or surprised, not when they're trying to cover up something. They kept making eye contact with whoever they were talking to, which feels like they're being open, and they nodded along while explaining things, like they were genuinely engaged. Also, their palms were facing up when they gestured a couple of times—those are classic signs of someone being relaxed and honest in conversations, not someone trying to hide something.  

But honestly, I'm not 100% certain. Sometimes people laugh nervously when they're lying, especially if they're trying to seem casual about something they're uncomfortable with. And raised eyebrows could just mean they're confused or skeptical about what they're saying, not necessarily truthful. I also wonder if the chin moving down was just a natural habit—like when people think before they speak—and not a sign of deception. It's hard to tell from just the video whether they're just a naturally expressive person or if they're being deceptive, because a lot of these cues overlap. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, but they didn't seem tense at all. Still, I can't rule out that they're just really good at faking it.  

All things considered, it just *feels* like they're being real—no awkward pauses, no fake smiles, and their body language seems aligned with what they're saying. But yeah, I'd want to hear more context or see them in another situation before I'd bet on it. It seems plausible they're telling the truth, but I'd hesitate to call it a certainty.

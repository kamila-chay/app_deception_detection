Watching this clip, I'm really trying to figure out if they're being truthful. Honestly, it's tricky because the cues aren't super clear-cut. On one hand, they're doing a lot of things that *could* signal stress or discomfort—frequent blinking, eyebrows raised and furrowed, and they keep looking down while talking. That downcast gaze and the way they're raising their eyebrows a bit makes me wonder if they're nervous, maybe even a little defensive. The head shaking at the end feels like a strong "no" or disagreement, which sometimes happens when people are trying to push back on a question they don't want to answer directly. If I were guessing based on common "lying" signs, I'd lean toward them being less than fully honest.

But then I keep noticing other things that make me second-guess. They're actually looking *at* the person they're talking to the whole time—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so that feels like engagement, not avoidance. People who lie often look away, so this seems counter to that. The head side-turning and the shaking might just be natural gestures, like when someone's thinking hard or just emphasizing a point, not necessarily deception. And they're not doing anything like covering their mouth, fidgeting, or scowling—those are classic "lie" indicators I'd expect to see if they were hiding something. The frowning could just be concentration, like they're trying to remember something accurately. 

I think the biggest thing is that the stress cues (blinking, eyebrows) could easily be from anxiety about the question itself, not lying. Maybe they're just uncomfortable answering, not lying. And the fact that they're not avoiding eye contact really stands out—it feels more like someone being honest but uneasy, not someone trying to cover up. But I'm not 100% sure. It's possible the blinking and head movements are masking something, but the eye contact makes me doubt it. Honestly, I'd say it's a maybe—leaning toward truth because the behavior doesn't scream deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It just feels more like someone being genuinely stressed about the topic than actively lying.

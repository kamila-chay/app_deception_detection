Hmm, watching this clip... I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest. The person isn't smiling, laughing, or frowning—no obvious emotional cues there. They're not avoiding eye contact either, which I've heard people say liars do, but they're not looking directly at the camera either, just... kind of neutral. The thing that stands out is they're raising their eyebrows a few times. Like, not super exaggerated, but definitely noticeable. 

Now, I know people often think liars have "tells," like fidgeting or weird eye movements, but here there's none of that. No blinking fast, no hands rubbing, no shifting around. If they were lying, I'd expect *something* to feel off, like a nervous tic or a forced expression. But this just seems... calm? Like they're just thinking or processing what they're saying. 

But wait—could raising eyebrows actually be a sign of lying? I've heard some people say it's a "micro-expression" for deception, like when you're trying to seem surprised to cover up a lie. But honestly, I've seen people raise their eyebrows all the time when they're genuinely confused or surprised, not when they're lying. And since there's no other weird behavior, it feels more like a natural reaction to the question they're answering, not a tell. 

The tricky part is, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe they're really good at hiding it, or maybe they're lying but just not nervous. But the *absence* of classic deception cues—like avoiding eyes, fidgeting, or fake smiles—makes me lean toward them being truthful. It’s not that they’re *proving* they’re honest, but it’s not screaming "liar" to me either. Honestly, it feels more like someone answering a straightforward question without any extra drama. I’d say truth, but I’m not totally certain—lying can be quiet, and truth can look quiet too. It’s just... the lack of red flags makes it feel more likely they’re being real.

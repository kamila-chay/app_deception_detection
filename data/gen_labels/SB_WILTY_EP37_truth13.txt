Okay, so I'm watching this clip, and honestly, I'm a bit torn. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or those nervous little tics people often associate with lying. They're actually making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is interesting because I've heard some think liars avoid eye contact, but I know that's not always true. They're looking down a bit, but not like they're avoiding—more like they're thinking or being reflective, which could go either way.

What stands out to me is how their head moves. They're tilting it, and their chin's moving up and down a bit—like they're nodding along or processing something, but not the full head nod. And their head actually leans back a little, which sometimes feels like someone trying to create distance, but it could just be natural posture. The thing that really makes me pause is that they don't have *any* of those classic "lie signs" you'd expect: no raised eyebrows, no exaggerated expressions, no lip biting or frowning. If they were lying, I'd half-expect them to be a little more... tense. But they're not. They seem relaxed, even a bit thoughtful.

On the flip side, though, I'm not 100% sold. Sometimes really skilled liars don't show those signs at all—they're just too practiced. Or maybe they're just a naturally calm person, and lying doesn't make them nervous. Like, what if they're not even lying? Maybe they're just answering a straightforward question without any stress. The lack of "nervous" behavior could actually support truthfulness, but I can't rule out that they're just hiding it well. I mean, I've seen people who lie all the time and never seem flustered. 

Also, the gaze down thing—I've read that people often look down when they're being truthful and recalling memories, but it could also be a way to avoid scrutiny. It's hard to say without knowing the context of the question. If they're being asked something personal, maybe looking down is just how they think. 

Honestly, after watching it a few times, I'd lean toward truth. The absence of stress cues feels more significant here than the head movements alone. But I'm not confident—like, I'd want to hear the actual question and answer to be sure. It's possible they're lying smoothly, but the behavior doesn't scream "deception" to me. It just feels... neutral, maybe even a little engaged. So yeah, I'd probably say they're telling the truth, but I'd still be like, "Well, it's not *proven*, but it's the most likely based on what I see."

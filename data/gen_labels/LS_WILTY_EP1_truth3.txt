Looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, the way they're holding their arms open feels really natural—like they're trying to seem approachable or genuine, which usually lines up with telling the truth. And that subtle lift at the corners of their mouth? It's not a full smile, but it feels like they're trying to be polite or engaged without overdoing it, which could just be them being friendly while answering. They also have this exaggerated eye opening—like they're really emphasizing something—and that made me think they might be stressing a point to make it sound real, which can happen when people are being honest about something important.

But then there's the gaze thing. They're looking down and sideways a lot instead of at the person they're talking to, which *can* be a sign of deception—like they're avoiding eye contact because they're uncomfortable. I've heard that some people do that when lying, but I also know it's super common for people to look away when they're thinking or just being shy, especially if they're not used to being on camera. And the raised eyebrows? That could mean they're surprised or trying to seem attentive, but it's also something people do when they're being careful with their words. It's hard to say if that's a red flag or just nervous energy.

I guess the thing that makes me lean slightly toward them telling the truth is the overall lack of other "lie" cues. No fidgeting, no fake smiles, no obvious signs of stress like rapid blinking or covering their mouth. If they were making it up, I'd expect more of those nervous habits. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so that's not a guarantee. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying and know the context to be safe. But based on what I see, the openness and lack of defensive gestures make me think they're probably being truthful, even if the gaze avoidance threw me off for a second. It's just... hard to tell without more to go on.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward this person telling the truth, but honestly, it's not 100% clear-cut. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that "gaze towards interlocutor" is strong, and it's paired with them looking up and down a bit while speaking. I've read that when people recall real memories, they often look up or away slightly, like they're mentally searching their brain, whereas liars might avoid eye contact or stare too intensely. Here, they're not avoiding it at all, which feels more natural for someone being truthful. 

The raised eyebrows also stand out—they're not fake or forced, just a natural lift, like they're processing something or genuinely surprised by what they're saying. And there's zero fidgeting: no hands rubbing, no lip biting, no awkward pauses. That calmness makes me think they're not stressed about lying. Truth-tellers often seem relaxed if they're confident in their story. 

But I can see why someone might question it. Raised eyebrows *can* sometimes signal deception if they're exaggerated or out of context, though here it seems genuine. And the shifting gaze—up and down—might look nervous to some people, but I think it's just them thinking through their words. Like, "Hmm, let me remember that part." If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like tight lips or sudden head movements, but they're totally still otherwise. 

Still, I wouldn't bet my life on it. Some people are great at hiding lies without moving much, and maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows. But based on what I'm seeing—the eye contact, the lack of physical tells, and that calm energy—I'd say the odds are higher they're being honest. It just doesn't feel like the "performance" of lying. Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect more "tells," but here it's all very... quiet. And that's the thing about truth-telling—it's usually quieter than lying.

Okay, so I just watched this clip, and honestly, it's a bit of a mixed bag. The person is smiling a lot—lip corners up, definitely a smile—and they're raising their eyebrows, which often feels like they're trying to seem engaged or maybe even a little surprised. But then their gaze is mostly down, and they're turning their head sideways a few times. That head turn especially stands out because it feels like they're avoiding direct eye contact, which I've noticed before can happen when people are being careful with what they say. The smile seems a bit... fixed? Like it's there but not really reaching their eyes, though I can't be 100% sure since it's just a clip. 

At the same time, their arms are open, which usually feels like they're trying to seem approachable or honest—like they're not hiding anything. That makes me pause because if they were lying, why would they have open arms? Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe the smile is just a nervous habit. I've known people who smile a lot when they're actually stressed or trying to cover something up, so it’s not foolproof. 

The down gaze is another thing—I think people often look down when they're thinking or recalling something, which could be neutral, but paired with the sideways head turn, it feels like they're not fully present in the conversation. Like they're mentally checking their story instead of just talking. But then again, maybe they're just shy or thoughtful. 

I keep circling back to the mismatch: the smile and open arms suggest openness, but the gaze and head movement feel like they're not fully connecting. It’s not like they’re fidgeting or avoiding eye contact completely, but the combination feels off. I wouldn’t say it’s a smoking gun, but it’s enough that I’d be leaning toward deception in my head. Still, I’m not sure—I’ve seen people smile and look down while being totally honest, especially if they’re just trying to be polite or calm. Maybe it’s just their natural way of talking. 

Honestly, I’d say it’s a maybe. The signals point a little more toward deception, but it’s not clear-cut. If I had to guess based on this alone, I’d say it’s suspicious, but I’d want to see more context before I’d be confident. Like, are they answering a question they’re unsure about? Is there a reason they’d be nervous? Without that, it’s just a hunch. But yeah, the smile feels a bit too consistent with the other subtle avoidance cues. I’d say deception is more likely, but I’d hesitate to call it definite.

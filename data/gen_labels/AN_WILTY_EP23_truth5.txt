Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person is maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're speaking to the whole time—no looking away, no glancing down or sideways. That’s the most noticeable thing. Normally, when people are being evasive or lying, they tend to avoid eye contact, but here they’re locked in, which feels like it could be a sign of honesty. They’re also not fidgeting at all—no hand movements, no shifting in their seat, no nervous ticks like biting their lip or touching their face. The way they’re speaking seems calm and composed, like they’re just calmly sharing something without any tension.

But then I keep thinking, "Wait, though—some people who lie are actually trained to keep eye contact. Like, they know it’s a 'truth' cue so they force themselves to stare, even if they’re lying." And honestly, it’s hard to tell if they’re just naturally good at staying focused or if they’re deliberately trying to seem sincere. There’s no other nervous behavior to hint at stress—no rapid blinking, no awkward pauses where they’re searching for words—so that leans toward truth, but it’s not impossible for a practiced liar to suppress those things. I guess the real question is, what’s the context? If this is a casual conversation where they’d have no reason to lie, the steady gaze makes sense. But if it’s something high-stakes, like a confrontation or a lie they’re trying to cover up, the eye contact might just be part of the performance.

I’m not 100% sure, but right now, the lack of any physical signs of anxiety or deception (which you’d usually see in liars) makes me lean toward them being truthful. It’s not that the eye contact *proves* it, but it’s the only thing I’m seeing that feels consistent with honesty, and there’s nothing contradicting it. Still, I’d want to hear more of the conversation to be really sure—sometimes people can look calm while lying, especially if they’re rehearsed. But based on the behavior alone, I’d say it’s probably truth.

Looking at this clip, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's really hard to tell just from body language alone. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which actually makes me lean a bit toward them being truthful. I've heard a lot about liars avoiding eye contact, but I know that's not always true—some people just naturally hold eye contact even when they're being honest. Plus, they're tilting their head a little while speaking, which often feels like someone is genuinely engaged or thinking about what they're saying, not trying to cover up something. It doesn't seem forced or nervous.  

But then again, I shouldn't rule out deception just because they're looking at the camera. Some people who lie are really good at maintaining eye contact—they might even overdo it to seem sincere. And while they're not fidgeting or doing obvious "tells" like covering their mouth or blinking a lot, the absence of those signs doesn't prove they're telling the truth either. Maybe they're just practiced at staying calm, or maybe they're not actually lying about this specific thing. I also wonder if the context matters—like, if they're answering something really personal, even a calm person might have subtle signs I'm missing.  

Honestly, the most I can say is that based on what I see, they seem relaxed and focused, which feels more like truthfulness than deception. But I wouldn't bet on it—body language is super subjective, and without knowing what they're talking about, it's easy to misread. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably being honest, but I'd still be a little cautious. You know? It's not like they're sweating or avoiding the question, but it's not a slam dunk either. I'd want more context before I'd feel confident either way.

Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm honestly a bit torn. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so that feels like a good sign for truthfulness. People who are lying often avoid direct eye contact or seem to be looking away, but here they're holding it pretty steady. They also don't have any of the classic "nervous" tells like fidgeting with their hands, scratching, or smiling awkwardly. In fact, they're not smiling at all, which is interesting—sometimes liars force smiles, but not here.  

But then there's the exaggerated eye opening and raised eyebrows. At first glance, that might make me think they're trying to seem sincere or emphasize something, but it could also just be genuine surprise or enthusiasm. Like, maybe they're reacting to a real memory or detail. And the gaze down part—sometimes people look down when they're thinking or being humble, not necessarily hiding something. The head side-turning feels a bit odd too, but that's probably just a natural gesture, like they're processing what they're saying.  

I guess the thing that leans me toward truth is how *calm* they seem overall. No fake laughter, no frowning, no lip movements that feel forced. If they were lying, I'd expect more micro-expressions or nervous energy, like the hands rubbing or frequent blinking we don't see here. But I can't rule out the possibility that they're just really good at controlling their reactions—some people lie without seeming flustered.  

Honestly, though, the absence of the usual "lie signs" makes me lean toward them being truthful. It's not 100% clear, but the way they're engaging with the other person without any of those red flags feels more like someone being genuine than someone trying to cover up something. Still, I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. It's hard to tell from just the body language alone, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're telling the truth.

Looking at the clip, I'm honestly not entirely sure. The person seems a bit tense, but it's hard to say if it's deception or just nervousness. What stands out is how often they raise their eyebrows—like, they're doing it a lot while they're talking, almost like they're trying to seem surprised or innocent. And their eyes keep drifting sideways, not really looking at whoever they're talking to. That makes me think maybe they're avoiding eye contact, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. But I've seen people do that even when they're being totally honest—maybe they're just shy, or they're not used to being on camera.  

Then there's the palms up thing—they're holding their hands open like they're trying to show they're being truthful, which is actually a gesture people often use when they *want* to seem trustworthy. That feels a bit contradictory to the other cues. If they were lying, wouldn't they be more likely to cross their arms or hide their hands? Instead, they're just sitting there with palms facing up, relaxed.  

On the flip side, the raised eyebrows could be a sign of stress—like, they might be worried about what they're saying, not necessarily lying. And the sideways glance? Could just mean they're thinking hard or trying to remember something, not that they're making it up. I've definitely done that myself when I'm trying to recall details.  

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The avoidance of direct gaze and the eyebrow thing lean toward deception, but the open palms and lack of other classic "lying" signs (like fidgeting or fake smiles) make me doubt it. Maybe they're just really anxious about the situation, not lying. I'd need more context—like what they're even talking about—to feel confident. Right now, I'd say it's possible they're hiding something, but it's equally possible they're just nervous. I wouldn't bet money on it either way.

Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't be completely certain. The frequent eyebrow raises come across as almost exaggerated, as if they're trying to appear surprised or innocent, which can sometimes be a tactic to persuade others of their truthfulness. Additionally, their eyes drift sideways rather than making steady contact, suggesting they might be avoiding direct eye contactâ€”a behavior often associated with hiding something. While some people do this out of shyness or discomfort on camera, combined with the other cues, it seems more telling here.

Their open palms gesture is interesting; while typically an attempt to appear honest, it can also be used deliberately to create a sense of trust. Rather than naturally relaxed, this stance might be an effort to convince the viewer. Normally, someone lying might show more closed-off body language, but this mismatch between their anxious facial expressions and seemingly open hands feels a bit off. 

The eyebrow raises and sideways glances might indicate stress or the effort to recall information, but when you put it all together, these cues tend to point toward some level of deception. While the absence of more obvious signs like fidgeting or forced smiles leaves some room for doubt, overall, I find myself inclined to suspect they are probably not being fully truthful. Still, without more context, I can't say for sure, but my impression leans toward them hiding something.

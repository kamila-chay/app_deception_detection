Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is that they're looking straight up—like, staring at the ceiling or sky—while they're talking. From what I've read about body language, when people are recalling actual memories (like when they're being truthful), they often look upward because their brain's accessing visual details. It's kind of the opposite of what you'd expect if they were lying, where people usually avoid eye contact by looking down or away. Here, they're not avoiding it—they're actively looking up, which feels like they're thinking hard about something real, not fabricating it.  

But I can see why it's tricky. Maybe they're just nervous or distracted, and the upward gaze is a habit, not a clue. I've seen people look up when they're stressed or just daydreaming, so it's not foolproof. And honestly, the rest of their behavior is super neutral—no fidgeting, no weird smiles, no obvious signs of anxiety like rapid blinking or crossing arms. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* tension, even if it's subtle. The fact that they're just... calm and still while looking up makes me think they're not trying to hide anything.  

Still, I'm not ruling out lying entirely. Some people are really good at lying without showing signs, and maybe this upward gaze is just coincidence. But between the two, the lack of other "lie" cues plus that upward gaze feels more consistent with someone being honest. It's not a slam dunk, but if I had to guess? I'd say truth.

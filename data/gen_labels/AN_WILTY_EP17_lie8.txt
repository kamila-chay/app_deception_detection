Hmm, looking at this video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's tricky because people act differently when they're nervous or just thinking things through. What stands out to me is how they keep their arms folded the whole time—like, they're not moving their hands around much at all. That kind of stillness can sometimes feel like someone's trying to hold themselves together, especially if they're not comfortable. And their chin? It seems to dip down a little when they're speaking, like they're looking down at the floor instead of meeting the camera. I've seen that before when people are trying to avoid eye contact, which some folks associate with lying. They also nod a lot while talking, which might just be them agreeing with themselves or trying to seem engaged, but it could also feel a bit forced if they're rehearsing what to say.

But here's where I get stuck—maybe it's not deception at all. Folding arms is super common; I do it when I'm cold or just relaxed. And that downward gaze? Could be cultural, or maybe they're just really focused on what they're saying, like they're trying to remember details. I've known people who naturally look down when they're thinking, not lying. The nodding too—some people just nod a lot when they're talking, like it's their habit. I mean, I know some studies say liars avoid eye contact, but I've also read that it's not reliable. Maybe they're just shy or the lighting is bad, making their eyes look down. Or maybe they're telling the truth but feel awkward about the question, so they're fidgeting less and looking away. Honestly, it's hard to tell without more context. I'd lean toward maybe they're hiding something, but I'm not confident at all—I could easily be wrong. It feels like they might be nervous, but nervousness doesn't always mean a lie. I'd want to see more of the conversation or hear what they're saying before I'd feel sure.

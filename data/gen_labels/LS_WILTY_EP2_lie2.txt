Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from watching the clip. On one hand, the person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually leans toward truthfulness. They're also got their arms open, which feels like an open, unguarded posture, and they're not avoiding the gaze or fidgeting much. That makes me think they might be comfortable with what they're saying.  

But then there are these little things that throw me off. They're smiling a lot, and their eyebrows are raised high—like, *really* exaggerated. It almost feels like they're trying too hard to seem friendly or relaxed, which sometimes happens when people are nervous about lying. The way they're opening their eyes wide and lifting their chin up also seems a bit over-the-top, like they're consciously trying to look sincere. And they keep glancing down while talking, which I've heard can be a sign of stress or overthinking—could be because they're rehearsing what to say, but it also makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact for a reason.  

I guess the counterargument is that all these "nervous" cues could just be them being naturally expressive or anxious about the situation, not necessarily lying. People get flustered in interviews or casual chats, and it doesn't always mean deception. The arms being open and the direct gaze feel like strong indicators they're being honest, so maybe the exaggerated expressions are just their default when they're trying to be polite.  

Honestly, I'm stuck between two thoughts. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward them *not* lying because the openness in their posture and eye contact feels more consistent with truthfulness than deception. But I wouldn't bet on it—those little over-the-top gestures could be a red flag. It's one of those cases where the cues are mixed, and without more context, it's really tough to say. Maybe they're just a very animated person!

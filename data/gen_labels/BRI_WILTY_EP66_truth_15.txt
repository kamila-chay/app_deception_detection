Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—I think it's pretty ambiguous. The person doesn't seem super tense or fidgety, which is interesting because if they were lying, I'd expect more nervous ticks like fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact *completely*. But here, they're looking sideways a lot, which usually makes me think of someone trying not to be caught in a lie. Like, if they're making up a story, they might glance away to avoid the pressure of holding eye contact. And they're raising their eyebrows a bit, which can sometimes happen when someone's trying to seem innocent or surprised, like "Wait, why would you think that?" 

But then again, I've seen people look sideways all the time when they're just thinking or feeling a little shy—maybe they're not used to being on camera, or they're just processing what they're saying. And the fact that they're not doing *anything* else that screams "nervous liar" is weirdly reassuring. No frowning, no lip-biting, no weird pauses where they seem stuck. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those things to show up, right? Like, even if they're trying to be calm, their body might give them away. Here, it feels... neutral. Almost like they're just answering a question they've thought about before, not scrambling to make something up. 

I guess the sideways gaze is the only thing that sticks out, but I keep wondering if it's just how they naturally talk. I mean, some people just don't like staring straight at people when they're speaking, and that doesn't mean they're hiding anything. It's hard to say for sure though—without more context, like what they're actually saying or the situation, it's tough to pin down. Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just because the rest of their behavior feels calm and consistent, but I wouldn't bet money on it. There's definitely room for doubt.

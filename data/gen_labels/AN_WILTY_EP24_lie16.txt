Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone, but I’ll try to walk through what I’m seeing. The person is definitely smiling and raising their eyebrows a lot while looking right at the person they’re talking to—head tilted slightly, like they’re listening intently. At first glance, the smile and eye contact feel like they’re trying to seem friendly or genuine, which could mean they’re being honest. But then the eyebrow raise sticks out to me—it’s not a casual lift, more like a quick, almost forced flick, which I’ve noticed before in people who are trying to seem surprised or calm while hiding something. And the smile… it’s there, but it doesn’t quite reach their eyes like a real one would, so it feels a bit stiff. That makes me wonder if they’re overcompensating to seem relaxed.  

On the flip side, though, they’re not avoiding eye contact (gaze is locked on the other person), and they’re not fidgeting or blinking a lot—those are classic signs people *think* liars show, but I’ve learned that’s not always true. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive, or maybe they’re genuinely comfortable with the conversation. The head tilt could just be them being engaged, not deceptive. Honestly, without more context—like what they’re actually saying or the situation—it’s hard to tell. I’ve seen people act like this when they’re telling the truth, especially if they’re nervous but trying not to show it.  

But the eyebrow thing keeps bugging me. It’s subtle, but in the few times I’ve seen deception cues, that kind of exaggerated, almost nervous eyebrow movement often pairs with other things, even if it’s not obvious. And since they’re smiling but not with the full expression (lip corners aren’t up, so it’s not a full grin), it feels like they’re trying too hard to seem okay. Still, I’m not 100% sure—I could be reading too much into it. Maybe they’re just excited or a little anxious about the topic, not lying. I’d lean toward deception just based on those little tells, but I’d want to hear the actual conversation before I’d feel confident about it. It’s one of those cases where it’s easy to second-guess yourself.

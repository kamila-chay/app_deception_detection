Watching this clip, the first thing that stands out is how the person's eyes move—they keep glancing up and then down, repeatedly, while they're speaking. I've heard that when people are recalling actual memories, they often look up like that because it's how the brain accesses stored information. It's a bit like when you're trying to remember a phone number—you might look up and to the side. If they were making something up, I'd expect more fidgeting or nervous gestures—like touching their face, avoiding eye contact, or even forced smiles—but they're not doing any of that. They're just sitting there with their eyes shifting, no other movement at all. That calmness feels... genuine? Like they're not stressed about what they're saying.

But then I think, wait—could that gaze pattern actually be a sign of lying? I've read some sources say liars sometimes look up when constructing a story, especially if they're trying to seem convincing. And honestly, the way they're avoiding direct eye contact (gazing up/down instead of at the person they're talking to) might make some people suspicious. Like, "Why aren't they looking at me?" But then I remember that truth-tellers often look away when they're thinking, too—especially if they're being careful with their words. It's not a clear tell. 

What really tips me toward thinking they're being honest is how *still* they are otherwise. No rapid blinking, no lip biting, no awkward pauses where they're struggling to keep it together. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little tension—like hands fidgeting or a tight jaw—but there's nothing. It feels like they're just speaking naturally, processing what they're saying. I mean, I'm not 100% certain, because people can be really good at hiding lies, but the lack of other nervous signs makes the gaze pattern feel less like deception and more like... just someone thinking out loud. So yeah, I'd lean toward truth, but I'd still be a little cautious. It's not like there's a smoking gun, just the absence of the usual red flags.

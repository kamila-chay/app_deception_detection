Looking at the clip, I’m kind of torn on this one. The person seems to be maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they’re talking to—like they’re trying to be really present, which could go either way. But what really caught my eye was how wide they kept opening their eyes, almost like they were trying to look extra innocent or surprised. It felt a little forced, you know? Like when someone’s being overly careful not to blink or look away. And then there’s the finger-crossing thing—they’re doing it subtly under the table, almost like they’re hiding it, but it’s there. I’ve heard that crossing fingers while talking can sometimes be a nervous habit when someone’s not being fully truthful, like a subconscious attempt to "cross their fingers" for luck or to ward off guilt.

But honestly, I’m not totally sure. I mean, maybe they just have naturally expressive eyes, or maybe they’re just really into the conversation and getting animated. Some people do have that wide-eyed look when they’re trying to listen hard. And the finger-crossing… it’s not like they’re doing it constantly or waving their hands around—it’s quiet, so maybe it’s just a nervous tic unrelated to lying. Like, maybe they’re just fidgeting because they’re tired or anxious about something else entirely. 

The fact that they’re not avoiding eye contact makes me lean away from "lying" a bit, since I’ve noticed liars often glance away or look down. But those two things—those exaggerated eyes and the crossed fingers—still stick out. It’s not a huge red flag, but it’s enough to make me wonder if they’re holding back on something. I’d say it’s *possible* they’re being deceptive, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want to see more context or hear the actual words to feel confident. For now, I’d lean toward "maybe," but I’m definitely not ruling out that it’s just their natural way of talking.

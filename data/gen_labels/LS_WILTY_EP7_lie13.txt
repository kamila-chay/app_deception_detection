Looking at the clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're being truthful or not. On one hand, they're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to—which usually feels like a sign of honesty, not deception. They're also nodding along and keeping their arms open, which seems relaxed and engaged, not like someone trying to hide something. But then there's that frequent blinking—like they're doing it way more than normal—and their chin keeps lifting up a bit, almost like they're tensing it. Those little things make me wonder if they're stressed or trying to hold back something.  

But honestly, it's not clear-cut. Frequent blinking can just mean they're tired or the lighting's weird, and chin movements might be a nervous habit unrelated to lying. Plus, they're not avoiding eye contact or fidgeting like people often do when they're deceptive—actually, they're looking around (down and sideways) but also directly at the other person, which feels inconsistent with typical "lying" cues. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of discomfort, like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, but they seem pretty composed otherwise.  

I guess I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I'm not sure. It's easy to overread small gestures, and without more context—like what they're talking about—it's hard to tell. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, or maybe they're being careful with their words. Either way, it doesn't scream "deception" to me like some other videos I've seen. I'd need more to go on before I'd feel confident calling it a lie.

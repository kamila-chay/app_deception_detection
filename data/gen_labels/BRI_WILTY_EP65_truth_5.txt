Hmm, I watched the clip a couple times to be sure. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs of stress like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiling. The only thing that stood out was them raising their eyebrows a couple of times, like they were genuinely surprised or processing something. I noticed they didn't blink much, didn't look away, and didn't have that "awkward pause" where someone might hesitate while lying. 

On the truth side, it feels like they're just speaking naturally—like they're telling a story they actually remember, not trying to hold something back. People who are lying often show more physical tension, even if they're trying to hide it, but this person seemed relaxed. The raised eyebrows could just be a natural reaction to what they're saying, like "Wait, really?" instead of a sign of deception. 

But... I guess you could argue the other way. Maybe they're *too* calm? Like, if they were lying, they might be suppressing all the usual nervous signs to seem believable. And that eyebrow raise—could it be a fake reaction, like they're trying to seem surprised to cover up? I've heard some people say liars do that to seem innocent. But honestly, it didn't feel staged to me. It looked more like a genuine moment of "Oh, right, I forgot about that part." 

I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I saw, it leans more toward them being truthful. The lack of stress cues seems more telling than the single eyebrow raise, which could easily just be a normal reaction. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs—like fidgeting or avoiding the gaze—since they didn't even do that. But yeah, it's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying. Still, my gut says they're telling the truth.

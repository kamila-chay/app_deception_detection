Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, it's a bit tricky to call. The person seems pretty calm the whole time—no fidgeting, no weird smiles or frowns, and they're not avoiding eye contact by looking down or away. In fact, they're actually looking up a lot, and their head is tilted like they're really thinking about what they're saying. I've heard people say that looking up can sometimes be a sign of recalling facts, like when you're trying to remember something, which might suggest they're being truthful. And that head tilt? It feels more like they're engaged or processing, not like they're trying to hide something. 

But then, I keep second-guessing myself because I've also heard that avoiding eye contact is often linked to lying, so looking up might actually be the opposite of what people expect. Like, maybe they're avoiding it on purpose to seem honest? Or maybe they're just naturally like that—some people just look up when they talk. Also, there's no nervous energy at all. No excessive blinking, no hands rubbing, nothing. That makes me lean toward "truth" because liars usually have more physical tells, right? But then again, I know some people are really good at hiding it, so the absence of signs might not mean anything. Maybe they're just really practiced. 

The thing that sticks with me is how relaxed they seem. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little tension—like a forced smile or a slight hesitation—but there's none of that. They're just speaking plainly, with that head tilt like they're genuinely trying to explain something. Still, I can't be 100% sure. It's possible they're lying so smoothly it doesn't show, or maybe they're just naturally calm. Honestly, I'm not going to say they're definitely lying or definitely telling the truth, but based on what I saw—no red flags, just someone thinking and speaking—I'm leaning toward them being truthful. But yeah, it's hard to say for sure. People are complicated.

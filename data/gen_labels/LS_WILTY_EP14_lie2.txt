Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—there are a few cues that make me lean toward deception, but others feel like they could just be nervous or thoughtful. Let me walk through why I'm torn.  

First, they're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to ("gaze towards interlocutor" is true), which usually suggests honesty, right? But they also keep looking down ("gaze down" is true), and that’s a bit confusing. I’ve heard that looking down can sometimes mean someone’s avoiding eye contact because they’re lying, but it could also just mean they’re concentrating or feeling a bit shy—like when you’re trying to remember something and you glance away. Then there’s the head moving forward and the side-turning; leaning in might show they’re engaged, but turning the head sideways feels a little off—like they’re not fully present in the conversation, which could hint at distraction or fabrication.  

On the flip side, their arms are open ("arms open" is true), which is a classic sign of being relaxed and open—usually associated with truth-telling. And they’re not doing any of the obvious "lying" tells: no forced smiles, no fidgeting, no rapid blinking. Their face looks neutral, which might mean they’re trying to keep it poker-faced, but it could also just mean they’re calm. The fact that they’re not covering their mouth or touching their face makes me think they’re not trying to hide something physically, which feels more honest.  

But here’s where I hesitate: the gaze down and the head movements together might be a red flag. If they were just thinking deeply, I’d expect more stillness—not these subtle shifts in head position. And the head moving forward while glancing down feels like they’re trying to "sell" something while avoiding direct eye contact, which is a combo I’ve seen in deceptive behavior before. Still, I can’t rule out that they’re just naturally expressive or that they’re genuinely upset about whatever they’re talking about. Maybe they’re recounting something sad, and that’s why they’re looking down—no deception needed.  

Honestly, without knowing the context of the conversation, it’s hard to say. The open arms and steady eye contact make me think they might be telling the truth, but the gaze down and head movements nudge me toward deception. I’d probably need to hear the actual words they’re saying to feel more confident. Right now, I’m leaning *slightly* toward deception because of how the gaze and head movements seem mismatched with the open posture, but I’d be hesitant to call it for sure. It’s one of those cases where it feels like they’re trying to seem sincere but something’s just… off.

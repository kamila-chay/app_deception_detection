Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. On one hand, they're holding steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me—like they're not avoiding looking at the other person, which sometimes happens when people are being deceptive. Their lips are pulled down a bit, which seems like they might be stressed or uncomfortable, but I've seen people look that way when they're just tired or genuinely upset about something, not necessarily lying. And they've got their arms folded the whole time, which honestly just feels like they're trying to stay warm or maybe just comfortable in their posture—not something I'd automatically read as "lying" behavior. 

But then, that head moving backward a few times catches my eye. It's subtle, but it feels like a bit of a defensive shift, like they're physically pulling away from the conversation a little. And the lip corners down... I wonder if that's because they're trying too hard to look serious or neutral, which sometimes happens when people are nervous about being caught in a lie. Still, it's not like they're smiling or laughing, which would be more suspicious if they were trying to fake it. 

The tricky part is I don't see any of the classic "tells" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that frantic blinking people often talk about. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more of those signs. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just naturally closed-off. Honestly, the arms folded and the steady gaze make me lean toward them being truthful, but that head movement keeps nagging at me. It’s a bit of a toss-up—I’d say it’s possible they’re being deceptive, but it’s also totally plausible they’re just a little stressed about the topic they’re discussing. Without more context, I can’t really say for sure. It’s hard to tell if the head movement is just a habit or if it’s a sign they’re not being fully open. Maybe they’re just not a very expressive person. I’d hesitate to call it deception without seeing more of the conversation.

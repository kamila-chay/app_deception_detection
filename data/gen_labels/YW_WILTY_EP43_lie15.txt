Looking at this clip, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not certain. They maintain steady eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, and their folded arms could simply be a comfortable posture or an attempt to stay warm, not necessarily a defensive or deceptive stance. However, the slight downward pull of their lips combined with the subtle backward movement of their head stands out—it seems like a small but meaningful sign of discomfort or a desire to distance themselves from the conversation. This kind of subtle defensive shift can sometimes indicate someone is being less than truthful, even if it’s not accompanied by classic signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting. While the lack of overt “tells” complicates the picture and could mean they’re just naturally closed-off or stressed genuinely, these minor cues make me inclined to suspect they might not be completely honest. It’s a bit of a gray area, but based on what I see, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance they’re being deceptive, even if it’s not clear-cut.

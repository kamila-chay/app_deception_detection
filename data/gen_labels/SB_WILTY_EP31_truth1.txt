Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video, but I'll try to break it down as I'm watching. So the person seems pretty calm overall—they're not fidgeting, no weird smiles or forced laughter, which is good. They're actually looking at whoever they're talking to most of the time, which usually means they're engaged, not avoiding eye contact like some people think liars do. But wait, they also keep glancing down and sideways a bit, which *could* be a sign they're thinking hard or even rehearsing, but honestly, I've seen truth-tellers do that too when they're recalling details. Like, if they're trying to remember a specific moment, they might look down to focus.  

The chin moving up is interesting—it's not a classic "truth" signal I've heard about, but it feels more like they're nodding along or emphasizing something, not like a nervous tic. And the head side-turning? That's just how some people talk, like they're processing what they're saying. I don't see any of the classic "lying" stuff: no lip-biting, no exaggerated gestures, no awkward pauses where they'd fumble for words. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more tension in the face or hands, but here everything's pretty relaxed.  

That said, I can't rule out lying entirely. Some really practiced liars don't show any signs—they might even look too calm, like they're just reciting a script. And the sideways glances *could* be a way to avoid direct eye contact while still seeming attentive, though that feels like a stretch. Honestly, the most telling thing is how *natural* it all seems—their movements aren't forced, and they're not overcompensating with any "tells." If I had to guess, it feels like they're being truthful, but I'd be lying if I said I was 100% sure. Body language's so messy, and context matters a lot—like, are they in a high-pressure situation? But from what I'm seeing, it just doesn't scream "deception" to me. It’s probably truth, but I’d want to hear the whole conversation to be safe.

I'm not totally sure, but watching this clip, I keep circling back to that smile paired with the head shake. Like, they're smiling while shaking their head "no" – that feels a bit off to me. Normally, when someone genuinely disagrees or says no, they don't smile, especially if it's a serious question. The smile seems a little too fixed, like they're trying to soften the rejection or make it seem less confrontational. And then the head tilting and raised eyebrows... it's like they're trying to appear thoughtful or even surprised, but the head shake is a direct contradiction. It’s hard to read as natural.

On the flip side, though, I could see someone being naturally expressive. Maybe they're just a cheerful person who smiles often, even when they're disagreeing. The palms-up gesture and shrug feel like they're trying to seem open or innocent – "I'm not hiding anything, I'm just telling you the truth." And the gaze is right on the person asking, which usually suggests honesty, not deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoiding of eye contact or fidgeting, but they seem pretty still otherwise. The head shaking might just be a reflexive "no" without any ulterior motive, especially if they're genuinely answering a question they don't want to say yes to.

Still, the combination of the smile *with* the head shake and the raised eyebrows – it just feels like they're overcompensating. Like they're aware it might sound negative, so they add the smile to make it seem friendly. But honestly, it’s tricky. It could easily be just their normal way of communicating. I’m leaning toward deception because the gestures don’t line up with what you’d expect from someone being straightforward, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It’s the kind of thing where if I had more context about the question they were answering, I might feel more confident. For now, I’d say it’s suspicious, but not a slam dunk.

Honestly, I'm a bit torn watching this. On one hand, the person's smiling a lot while they're talking, which feels a little off—like it's not quite matching what they're saying. And they keep raising their eyebrows, which I've noticed sometimes happens when people are trying too hard to seem relaxed or genuine. The way their chin lifts up subtly while they're speaking also stands out to me; it's not a big movement, but it's there, and I've heard that can sometimes signal nervousness or overcompensation. Then there's the gaze—they're looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which you'd expect from someone being honest, but they also keep glancing sideways a few times. That sideways look feels a bit like they're avoiding direct eye contact, which I've read is a common sign of deception when it's inconsistent. The head turning to the side too, like they're shifting their weight while thinking, adds to that feeling.

But here's why I'm not totally convinced they're lying: smiling can just be their natural way of engaging, especially if they're trying to be friendly. Some people genuinely smile while they talk, even when they're telling the truth. And the eyebrow-raising? Could just be them reacting to what they're saying, not necessarily being deceptive. The sideways glance might not mean anything—it could just be how they move their head when they're thinking, like they're not used to being recorded. I mean, I've seen people do that all the time without it meaning they're hiding something. Honestly, it's really hard to tell from just this clip. The cues lean a little toward deception, but they're not super clear-cut, and I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying or how they act in other situations—before I'd feel confident about it. For now, I'm leaning toward "maybe," but I wouldn't bet on it.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty steady—no obvious fidgeting, no shifting eyes away, and they're consistently looking directly at the camera (or whoever they're speaking to). That steady eye contact makes me lean toward them telling the truth, honestly. I've read that truth-tellers often maintain better eye contact than liars, especially if they're not overly nervous, and this feels like that kind of calm, engaged presence. They’re not avoiding the gaze, which is a common thing people do when they’re lying, so that’s a point in their favor.  

But then I keep thinking—wait, some people just naturally look at you when they talk, even when they’re being vague or not entirely honest. Like, maybe they’ve practiced speaking to the camera, or they’re just the type who’s comfortable making eye contact no matter what. I’ve also heard that in some cultures, direct eye contact is seen as rude, so if this person’s background is different, it might not mean anything about truthfulness at all. And honestly, the lack of any other "tells"—like no awkward pauses, no hand movements, no forced smiles—could also mean they’re really rehearsed, which isn’t always about truth.  

Still, I’m not sure. The video doesn’t show any of the classic signs that make people suspicious—no nervous blinking, no looking away when they should, no tense body language. It just feels… relaxed. Like they’re speaking naturally, not trying too hard. If I had to guess right now, I’d say truth, but I’d be hesitant to swear on it. It’s possible they’re just very good at hiding it, or maybe they’re not lying but just not great at expressing emotion. Honestly, it’s hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what’s in front of me, the truth seems more likely than not.

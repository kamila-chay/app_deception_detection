Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it’s pretty ambiguous. They’re smiling, which is a bit confusing because when people are deceptive, their smiles can sometimes look forced or don't quite match their eyes, but here the smile seems pretty natural. They’re also raising their eyebrows a lot, which I’ve noticed before can happen when someone’s trying to seem surprised or innocent, but it could just be them being expressive or genuinely reacting to what they’re saying.  

What stands out to me is how they keep moving their chin upward—like they’re deliberately trying to look confident or "chin up," which sometimes happens when someone’s nervous about lying. And they’re looking straight at the person they’re talking to, which feels like they’re trying to seem sincere, but they’re also glancing up occasionally, which usually means they’re thinking or recalling something, not necessarily lying. The sideways head tilt is interesting too—it’s a common sign of engagement or curiosity, not something I’d immediately associate with deception.  

But here’s where I hesitate: they’re not fidgeting at all. No hands rubbing, no scratching, no avoiding eye contact—actually, they’re maintaining pretty steady eye contact. I’ve heard that liars often fidget more, so the lack of that makes me lean a little toward them telling the truth. Then again, the smile and eyebrow raises could still be nervous tells, especially since they’re not laughing or frowning, which might mean they’re suppressing emotions.  

Honestly, it’s hard to say. The chin movement and the way they’re holding their gaze feel a bit off for someone being completely honest, but the absence of classic "nervous" cues (like blinking a lot or touching their face) makes me think maybe they’re just calm and rehearsed. I’d probably need to hear the actual words they’re saying to be more certain—sometimes the context changes everything. I’m not going to call it deception for sure, but I wouldn’t rule it out either. It feels like they’re being careful, but "careful" could mean truth or lie. I’d say it’s a maybe.

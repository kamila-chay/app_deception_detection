Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because there's no clear "smile" or obvious signs like fidgeting, but a few things stand out that make me lean toward them not being completely relaxed. They're blinking really frequently—way more than normal when someone's just talking casually—and their mouth opens up a bit exaggeratedly, like they're trying to say something but holding back a little. Their lips are pulled up at the corners too, but not in a real smile, more like a tight, forced thing. And their chin is moving up and down a lot, which feels a bit nervous, like they're swallowing or tensing up. They keep looking down and sideways instead of meeting the person's eyes directly, and their head's tilting and turning a bit, like they're trying to avoid being too focused on the conversation. 

But here's where I hesitate: I've seen people get really nervous on camera even when they're telling the truth—maybe they're just shy or stressed about being filmed. That frequent blinking could just be dry eyes or general anxiety, not deception. And the head movements? Sometimes people do that when they're thinking hard about what to say, not necessarily lying. The fact that they're not covering their mouth or fidgeting with their hands actually makes me wonder if they're *too* calm for a lie, which some people do when they're practiced at hiding it. Plus, the lip corners up might just be their natural expression when they're concentrating, not a fake smile. 

I guess what's really throwing me off is the lack of "classic" lie signs—no scowling, no obvious avoidance, no crossed arms. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical tension or those "tells" we hear about. But the blinking and the way their mouth opens... it feels off-kilter for someone who's completely comfortable. Still, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're just bad at controlling their face when they're anxious, or maybe they're telling the truth about something that makes them genuinely uneasy. Without knowing what they're talking about, it's hard to say if the behavior fits a lie or just general nerves. I'd say it's *possible* they're not being fully truthful, but it's not a slam dunk—I'd need more context to feel confident either way.

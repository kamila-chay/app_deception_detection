Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning a little toward them not being entirely truthful. The thing that stands out most is how often they're blinking—like, *really* frequently. I've heard people say that's a sign of stress or trying to control your thoughts when lying, but I know it's not foolproof. They could just be tired, or maybe the room is bright, or even have an eye irritation. 

What makes me hesitate is that they're actually making pretty steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, and they're nodding along like they're engaged. That usually feels like someone being open, not deceptive. Plus, their arms are wide open—like, really relaxed and inviting—which people often do when they're trying to seem trustworthy. If they were lying, I'd expect them to cross their arms or seem more closed off, not the opposite. 

But then there's the head shaking—they keep shaking it side-to-side while nodding. It’s a little confusing; like they're saying "no" to something while also agreeing. That inconsistency could be a red flag for me, but it might just be how they naturally gesture when they're thinking. Like, maybe they're disagreeing with a point but still trying to be polite. 

On the flip side, I keep thinking, "Maybe they're just nervous about the situation, not lying." People get anxious in interviews or when they're being recorded, and that can make them blink a lot or fidget. The fact that they're not smiling or frowning feels neutral, which could just mean they're focused, not deceptive. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The frequent blinking *makes me wonder*, but all the other cues—eye contact, open posture, nodding—feel like they're trying to seem genuine. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe they're stressed about the topic, but not necessarily lying. But I wouldn't bet on it either way. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need more context to be sure.

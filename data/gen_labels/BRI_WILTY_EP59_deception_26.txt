Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from what I'm seeing. The person seems pretty steady while talking—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're speaking to, which usually makes me lean toward them being truthful. Like, when people are hiding something, they often avoid looking directly at you, right? But here, they're holding that gaze, and they're also glancing up occasionally. I've heard that when people recall actual memories, they tend to look up and to the side a bit, like their brain's processing the visual part of the memory. That feels like it could be natural, not forced.

But then again, I've also seen people who lie really well, especially if they've practiced it, and they'll *force* themselves to make eye contact to seem honest. So that steady gaze might not mean much—it could just be them being careful. And the fact that they're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, not touching their face... that's the opposite of what I'd expect from someone stressed about lying. Usually, when people are deceptive, they have all these little nervous habits, but here it's all very calm. It's almost *too* calm, which sometimes makes me wonder if they're overcompensating.

The "gaze up" detail is the thing that sticks with me though. If they were making it up, I'd expect them to look down or away more often, like they're fabricating something. But looking up feels like they're actually trying to remember something real. Still, I'm not 100% sure—maybe they're just used to looking up when they talk, regardless of whether it's true. It's hard to tell without knowing the context of the conversation. Like, were they answering a simple question or something that might require thinking? If it was a simple "yes/no," the gaze up might not mean much, but if it was a detailed story... well, that's where it gets interesting.

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth just based on how relaxed they seem, but I'd want to see more of the clip or hear the actual question to be sure. The absence of classic "lie cues" is pretty strong, but I've learned not to trust that too much because some liars are really good at hiding it. So yeah, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd hesitate to say it's definite. It feels like they're being genuine, but I can't rule out the possibility they're just very skilled at it.

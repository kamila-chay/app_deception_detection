Honestly, watching this clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I can't say for sure. The way they're sitting with arms open and head up, looking directly at whoever they're talking to—that feels like natural engagement to me. When people are being truthful, especially in a conversation, they often keep their body language open like that, not crossed or closed off. The fact that they're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, and not showing any of those little nervous tells like frequent blinking or lip biting makes it seem less like they're trying to hide something. 

But here's where I hesitate: raising eyebrows can sometimes happen when someone's thinking hard, which *could* be part of constructing a lie. And "gaze up" might mean they're recalling something, which isn't always a lie sign—it could just be them gathering their thoughts. I mean, I've seen people look up when they're being honest too, like when they're trying to remember a detail. The lack of other "lie cues" is strong though—no awkward pauses, no scowling, no hands covering their mouth. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those subtle signs to pop up, especially if they're not super practiced at hiding it. 

Still, I know people can be really calm under pressure, so maybe they're just good at staying composed. But overall, the open posture and direct gaze feel more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying. It's not 100% definitive, but based on what I see, I'd guess they're being truthful. It just doesn't *feel* like the behavior of someone who's trying to pull one over on someone else.

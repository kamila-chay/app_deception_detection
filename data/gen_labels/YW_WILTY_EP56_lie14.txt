I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. What stands out to me is that they keep raising their eyebrows a few times during the conversation—like when they're responding to a question. I've read that people sometimes do that when they're trying to seem innocent or to buy a second to think, which could be a sign of lying. But then again, I've also seen people raise their eyebrows naturally when they're genuinely surprised or emphasizing a point, especially when they're trying to be clear. They're also making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which I've heard is often associated with truthfulness because liars sometimes avoid looking directly at people. But I know that's not a hard rule—some people who lie deliberately make more eye contact to seem honest. And they're nodding along too, which feels like they're engaged, but that could just be them being polite or trying to seem cooperative, whether they're lying or not. 

What's making me lean a little toward them being truthful is that I don't see any of the classic "deception tells" I've learned about, like fidgeting, avoiding the gaze, or forced smiles. They're not shifting around, not looking down or away, and their mouth isn't tense or closed off like it often is when people are nervous. If they were lying, I'd expect to see more of those signs, but they're just... calm. Still, I'm not sure. Some people are really good at lying without showing stress—maybe they're practiced, or maybe they're just not the type to get flustered. It's also possible that the eyebrow-raising is just a habit for them, not a cue at all. 

Honestly, it's tricky. The eye contact and lack of other stress behaviors make me think they might be telling the truth, but I can't say for certain. I'd hesitate to call it a definite "truth" because deception is so nuanced, and sometimes the absence of cues doesn't mean anything. I'd say it's a maybe—leaning toward truthful, but I wouldn't bet on it. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably being honest, but I'd want to see more context or talk to them directly to be sure.

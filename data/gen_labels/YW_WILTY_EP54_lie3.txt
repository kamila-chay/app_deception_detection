Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really trying to figure it out. On the surface, they seem pretty engaged—smiling, raising their eyebrows like they're genuinely surprised or interested, and mostly keeping eye contact with whoever they're talking to. That direct gaze and the smile (lip corners up, not forced-looking) usually make me think they're being straightforward. Like, when people are comfortable, they often do that natural "oh, that's interesting!" face with the eyebrows up and a soft smile. 

But then there's that sideways glance they keep making—gaze sideways is listed as true. That's throwing me off. I've heard that when people are lying, they sometimes look away or shift their gaze sideways to avoid direct eye contact, like they're trying to not get caught. But I also know that sideways glances can happen for other reasons—maybe they're just scanning the room, or they're nervous and fidgeting with their thoughts, not necessarily lying. And the smile... it's a bit tricky. If it were a real smile, their eyes might crinkle a little, but the description doesn't say that. It could be a polite or practiced smile, which sometimes happens when people are being careful with what they say. 

I'm leaning a little toward deception because of that sideways glance paired with the smile—it feels a bit off, like they're trying to seem friendly while actually holding back something. But honestly, I'm not sure. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're talking about something that makes them a little anxious but not dishonest. The fact that they're not avoiding eye contact entirely (gaze toward interlocutor is true) makes me think they're trying to be honest, but the sideways thing keeps nagging at me. Like, if they were fully comfortable, would they keep glancing away like that? I guess it's possible they're just not used to being on camera or something. 

At the end of the day, I can't say for sure. It's one of those cases where the cues are mixed—not clearly lying, but not clearly truthful either. I'd probably ask them to clarify the part they looked away from, but based on the video alone? I'd say it's a maybe, leaning toward deception, but I'd need more context to feel confident. It's easy to misread these things, especially when someone's being careful to seem normal.

This one is a bit tricky to call from the video alone, but I’m leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive. They maintain steady eye contact and nod consistently, which might initially suggest engagement and truthfulness since liars often look away or appear distracted. However, that same behavior could also be interpreted as overcompensation—someone trying too hard to seem trustworthy by holding unwavering gaze and excessive nodding. The lack of typical stress signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact might mean they are experienced at hiding deception.

The raised eyebrows add another layer of ambiguity. While raised eyebrows can indicate surprise or sincerity, they could also be a subtle sign of tension as the person tries to maintain their story. It’s hard to say definitively because people raise their eyebrows for many reasons, including genuine thought or confusion, not just lying.

Overall, the calm and engaged demeanor might mask something, and the absence of obvious stress signals doesn’t necessarily rule out deception. Given these nuances, I’m inclined to lean toward the person possibly lying, though it’s far from certain. More context or hearing what they actually say would be needed for a stronger judgment.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the video, and the person seems pretty calm overall. The only thing that stands out to me is that they raised their eyebrows a couple of times while answering—like when they were explaining the part about the meeting being rescheduled. It wasn't super exaggerated, just a natural lift, maybe like they were surprised the question came up. 

Now, I'm not sure if that means they're lying or not. On one hand, raised eyebrows can sometimes happen when someone's being truthful—they're processing the question, maybe genuinely recalling details, and that little lift is just their natural reaction. I've seen people do that when they're telling the truth about something unexpected. Plus, they never looked away from the person asking the question, which I've heard is a sign of honesty sometimes, though I know that's not always reliable. They also didn't fidget or blink a lot, which are things I've heard people do when they're nervous or lying. 

But then again, I've also seen people raise their eyebrows on purpose when they're trying to seem sincere or to cover up a lie. Like, they might do it to look "surprised" or "honest" even if they're not. And honestly, it's hard to tell if that eyebrow lift was genuine or just a habit. They didn't seem stressed or rushed either—just calm and straightforward. 

I guess the thing that leans me toward them being truthful is that there's just... nothing else. No signs of deception popping up—no avoiding eye contact, no shaky hands, no weird pauses. Usually, if someone's lying, you'd see *something*, right? But here, it's just a normal conversation with that one eyebrow thing. Maybe they were just being genuinely surprised about the question, and that's why they raised their eyebrows. 

Still, I can't be 100% sure. It's possible they're really good at hiding it, or maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows. Like, maybe they do that all the time, even when they're telling the truth. I'd want to hear more of the context or see the whole conversation to be better sure. But based on what I'm seeing here, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—not because of the eyebrows alone, but because there's no other red flags. It just feels... unforced. But yeah, I'm not totally confident. It's one of those cases where the absence of lies feels like it might mean truth, but you never really know.

Honestly, watching the clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I can't say for sure. The way they're holding their hands with palms up and arms open feels really open and unguarded—like they're not trying to hide anything or create physical barriers. Their head is tilted slightly while looking directly at the person they're talking to, which usually reads as engaged and sincere, not like they're dodging eye contact or faking it. I don't see any of those classic nervous tells either: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses with their mouth shut, no raised eyebrows or scowling. It just seems... relaxed. Like they're genuinely sharing something, not rehearsing a lie.  

But I'll admit, I'm not 100% certain. Some people are just naturally calm under pressure—they might not show physical signs of lying even if they're being deceptive, especially if they've practiced it before. And head tilting could sometimes just be a habit, not a sign of honesty. Maybe they're just good at staying cool, or maybe they're so confident in their story that they don't feel the need to hide. I also wonder if the cultural context matters—palms up is often seen as honest, but could it mean something else here? Like, maybe it's a gesture they always use, not tied to truthfulness.  

Still, the absence of deception cues feels stronger than the counterarguments here. If they were lying, I'd expect *some* sign of tension—like avoiding eye contact, touching their face, or that stiff "mouth closed" pause people do when they're fabricating. But there's none of that. It just looks like a normal, calm conversation. So yeah, based on what I'm seeing, I'd guess they're telling the truth, but I'd want to hear the full context before I'd be totally sure. It's not a slam dunk, but the behavior lines up with honesty more than deception.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because people can act all sorts of ways, and I don't want to jump to conclusions. What stands out to me is how relaxed they seem—they're smiling, laughing naturally (not forced, like it feels like they're genuinely amused), and they keep making eye contact with the person they're talking to. Their body language is open too: arms wide open, nodding along like they're fully engaged, and even tilting their head a bit like they're listening closely. Those are all things I'd usually associate with someone being honest, not hiding something. The raised eyebrows too—they look like they're reacting to what's being said, not trying to fake surprise.  

But then I think, "Wait, could they be faking all this?" I've heard that some people lie by smiling more or laughing to seem friendly, so maybe that's what's happening here. And the head shaking—like when they say "no" to something—could be a bit confusing. If they're denying something, that might hint at deception, but it's paired with all the other positive cues, so it feels less like a lie and more like they're just disagreeing with a point, not hiding the truth.  

Still, I don't feel 100% sure. Maybe they're just a really expressive person who laughs easily, or maybe they're nervous but covering it with smiles. The lack of fidgeting or avoiding eye contact (which I'd expect if they were lying) makes me lean toward truth, but I know those signs aren't foolproof—some liars are super calm. Honestly, the more I watch, the more it feels like they're just being themselves, not putting on a show. So yeah, I'd guess they're telling the truth, but I'd definitely want to see more context before I'd say it for sure. It just doesn't *feel* like lying, even if I can't rule it out entirely.

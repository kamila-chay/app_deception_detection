Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I can see why someone might second-guess it. The way they're sitting with their arms open and actually looking at the person they're talking to feels pretty genuine. Like, when people are being deceptive, they often avoid eye contact or cross their arms, but here they're keeping their arms wide open and their gaze directed at the other person, even if it's a bit downward. That downward gaze could make someone think they're hiding something, but it might just mean they're thinking carefully or feeling a little shy, not lying.  

Then there's the head stuff—tilting, turning, and moving back a bit. At first glance, that might seem nervous, like someone who's uncomfortable, but I've noticed that people often do that when they're really trying to listen or process what they're saying, not when they're lying. The chin moving down is a bit odd too, but it could just be a natural gesture while they're speaking, not a sign of deception. I've seen people do that when they're being earnest, like when they're trying to emphasize a point.  

On the flip side, I get why someone might think they're lying. The head moving backward and the downward gaze *can* sometimes signal discomfort or evasion, especially if it's paired with other signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. But here, they're not fidgeting at all—they're pretty still except for those head movements. And the lack of any "telling" signs like fake smiles, exaggerated expressions, or lip biting really stands out. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those micro-expressions, like trying too hard to smile or looking away a lot.  

Honestly, the open arms and consistent eye contact (even if it's a little down) feel more like someone who's just being thoughtful or maybe a bit awkward, not someone trying to cover up a lie. I'm not 100% certain, though—human behavior is messy. Maybe they're just naturally a quiet person, or maybe they're genuinely upset about something, and that's why they're looking down. But based on what I see, I'd say the truth feels more likely than the lie. It's not a slam-dunk, but it's the best I can tell from the video alone.

Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. Honestly, it's not super clear-cut. What stands out to me is that they're raising their eyebrows a lot while they're talking—that kind of "wait, what?" look—and they're nodding a lot, like they're really trying to emphasize agreement. Then there's the palms-up thing, which feels a bit odd because it's not something I usually see people do casually. In my experience, when someone's palms are up like that while speaking, it can sometimes feel like they're trying to seem open or innocent, but it also makes me wonder if they're overcompensating because they're nervous.

On the flip side, though, I'm not totally convinced. Maybe they're just naturally expressive with their eyebrows—some people do that when they're thinking or trying to be friendly. And the nodding? Could be they're genuinely agreeing with whatever they're saying, not trying to fake it. The palms-up gesture might just be a habit or how they gesture when they're talking, especially if they're trying to be extra clear. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic "lying" stuff like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or looking away a lot—actually, the description says they're not looking at the person they're talking to, but that could just mean they're thinking or focused on their own words, not necessarily deceptive. 

I keep going back to the eyebrow-raising and the palms-up together—they feel a bit forced, like they're trying to seem engaged or honest, but it's not matching the rest of their behavior. Like, if they were really telling the truth, I'd expect the gestures to feel more natural, not so... deliberate. But I could totally be wrong. Maybe they're just a very animated speaker, or this is a cultural thing where palms-up is normal. I'm leaning toward deception because of how those three things stack up, but I'd need to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. It's one of those cases where the behavior feels off, but it's not screaming "liar" at me, so I'm really on the fence.

Looking closely at this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. What catches my attention is the repeated raising of their eyebrows, which gives off a kind of "wait, what?" expression, paired with frequent nodding that seems almost overly emphatic. Then there’s the palms-up gesture, which strikes me as somewhat unusual in a casual setting. From my experience, when someone uses that gesture while talking, it can come across as an attempt to appear open or innocent, but it might also suggest overcompensation due to nervousness.

While there are reasons to doubt, such as the possibility that the eyebrow raising is just a natural way they express themselves or that the nodding truly reflects agreement, the combination of these gestures seems a bit forced. They don’t show typical signs of lying like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, though the fact that they aren’t looking at the person they're speaking to could hint at them focusing internally, which doesn’t necessarily mean deception but is worth noting.

The mismatch between the seemingly deliberate gestures and the rest of their behavior feels somewhat off. If they were straightforward, I would expect their actions to feel more effortless and genuine rather than intentional. Though I can’t be completely sure and there could be cultural or personal quirks at play, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful, even if it’s not definitive. This feels like a situation where the behavior is suspicious enough to raise doubts, but not quite enough to say with confidence that they’re lying.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because some of their actions seem to contradict each other. On one hand, they're smiling (lip corners up) and nodding while looking right at the person they're talking to—those usually feel like signs of being engaged or truthful, like they're trying to seem cooperative. But then there's this weird mix of frowning eyebrows *and* raised eyebrows at the same time, which just looks tense. Like, they're trying to look calm but it's not quite working. And the way they keep covering their mouth with their hand? That's the part that sticks out to me. I've heard that covering your mouth can be a nervous habit, like you're trying to stop yourself from saying something you shouldn't, or just hiding how you're feeling. It's not the most obvious sign, but it's one I've noticed in other videos where people seem off.

But wait—could it just be them being naturally expressive? Like, maybe they're just a little anxious about the situation and that's why they're frowning and covering their mouth, not because they're lying. I mean, they're smiling too, so it's not like they're scowling or anything. Sometimes people smile while they're stressed, especially if they're trying to hide it. And they're looking at the other person the whole time, which usually goes against the "liars avoid eye contact" idea. So maybe they're just nervous about the interview or whatever this is, but telling the truth. 

Still, the hand covering the mouth feels heavier to me. It's a subtle thing, but when combined with the mismatched facial expressions (smiling but frowning?), it just doesn't feel *right*. Like, if they were just nervous, I'd expect more fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, but they're doing the opposite. Maybe they're trying too hard to seem calm, and the hand covering is giving it away. I'm not totally sure though—people are complicated, and I don't want to jump to conclusions. It's definitely leaning toward deception, but I'd need more context to be confident. Like, what's the situation? If they're talking about something that would make them nervous to lie about, that'd make me lean harder toward "deception," but if it's just small talk, maybe it's just nerves. Yeah, I think I'm going to say deception, but with a lot of "maybe" and "could be." It's not 100%, but the hand thing feels like a red flag.

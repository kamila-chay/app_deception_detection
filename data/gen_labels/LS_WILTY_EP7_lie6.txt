Looking at the clip, it seems like they might be lying, although I'm not completely certain. Their behavior is a bit conflicting—on one hand, they’re smiling and maintaining eye contact, which usually suggests honesty or engagement. But then, there’s this strange combination of frowning and raised eyebrows at the same time, which comes across as tense or uneasy. What really stands out is the way they keep covering their mouth with their hand. That gesture often indicates nervousness or an attempt to hide something, which can be a subtle sign of deception.

Now, it’s possible they’re just naturally expressive or anxious about the situation, which might explain the mixed facial signals and the hand covering. People sometimes smile when they’re stressed, and they might keep eye contact even if they’re uncomfortable, so this doesn’t definitively prove they’re lying. However, when you put together the inconsistent facial expressions with the hand-over-mouth gesture, it does raise some doubts. If they were simply nervous but truthful, you might expect more fidgeting or avoidance of eye contact, yet here they seem to be trying too hard to appear calm.

While I can’t say for sure, the signs lean more toward them being deceptive. The hand covering their mouth feels like a small but meaningful red flag, suggesting they could be hiding their true feelings or facts. Without more context, it’s hard to be definitive, but overall, I would lean toward thinking they might not be fully honest.

This situation is somewhat ambiguous, but I find myself leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying. While they maintain eye contact for the most part—which often suggests honesty—they also glance down and tilt their head sideways occasionally, behaviors that could indicate discomfort or an attempt to mask the truth. The absence of classic nervous signs like fidgeting or forced smiles might seem reassuring at first, but it’s important to remember that some individuals who lie deliberately appear calm and maintain steady eye contact to project sincerity. Those subtle gaze shifts downward could be a sign of inner conflict or hesitation, even if they can also occur when someone is simply thinking. Overall, while there aren’t overt signs of deception, the combination of these subtle cues makes me inclined to suspect they may not be completely truthful, though I wouldn’t say this with absolute certainty. More context or information would be needed to be more confident in this judgment.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I noticed they kept eye contact with the person they were talking to most of the time—which usually makes me think they're being straightforward, since liars often avoid direct gaze. But then they'd glance down occasionally and tilt their head while turning it sideways a bit, which made me wonder if they were thinking or maybe trying to seem more engaged. I didn't see any of the classic nervous tells—no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no excessive blinking or lip-pulling like I'd expect if they were hiding something. That part actually leans toward them being truthful.  

But here's where I'm second-guessing: sometimes people who lie *do* try to look calm and make eye contact to seem honest, so maybe the lack of obvious stress cues is actually a red herring. And those gaze shifts down and sideways—could that be a subtle way of avoiding the truth while still seeming attentive? I've heard some people say that when people look down while answering, it's a sign of discomfort, but I also know it's super common for people to glance away when they're just thinking through an answer, especially in a casual conversation.  

Honestly, the more I watch, the less convinced I am they're lying. The absence of those physical "deception markers" feels more significant than the head tilts or sideways glances, which seem like normal conversational habits. But I'm not 100% sure—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying or see more context before I'd feel confident. It's possible they're just a naturally calm person, or maybe they're rehearsed enough that it doesn't show. So yeah, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd still be a little hesitant to say for sure.

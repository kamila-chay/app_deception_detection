Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but after watching this clip a few times, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The thing that stands out most is how they're covering their mouth with their hands while talking—that feels really natural, like they're just trying to hold it together or maybe feel a bit nervous about the question. I've seen people do that when they're genuinely thinking hard about an answer, not just when they're lying. Like, if they were making something up, they might seem more tense or stiff, but here they're just... fidgeting a bit, touching their head, and their eyes keep darting down and sideways. 

That sideways glance and looking down? Yeah, that could *sound* like they're avoiding eye contact, which people sometimes associate with lying. But I've also seen lots of people look away when they're trying to remember something or feel awkward, even when they're being honest. Like, maybe they're just shy or the question caught them off guard. The raised eyebrows too—they're not fake or exaggerated, just a little surprised or thoughtful, which feels real. 

But I get why someone might think they're lying. Covering the mouth *is* a common "tell" people point to, and the sideways gaze could seem evasive. If I were in a hurry or didn't have context, I might second-guess. But the more I watch, the less it feels like deception and more like someone who's just... human—maybe tired, maybe a little stressed about the situation, but not hiding anything. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs: fidgeting with hands *more*, maybe avoiding eye contact entirely, or that stiff, fake smile they don't have. Here, it's all just subtle, quiet stuff. Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I see, I'd guess they're being truthful. It just doesn't *feel* like a lie.

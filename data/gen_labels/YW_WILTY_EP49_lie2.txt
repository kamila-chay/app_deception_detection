Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not, and honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. What stands out to me is how much they're blinking—like, way more than normal. I've noticed that when people are stressed or trying to think of something, they blink faster, so that makes me wonder if they're uncomfortable with the question. But then, I also see them making steady eye contact and nodding along while answering. To me, that feels like someone who's engaged and trying to be clear, not someone dodging the truth. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more or maybe fidget, but they're not doing any of that—no hands rubbing, no shifting in their seat. The nodding especially feels natural, like they're agreeing with their own thoughts while answering, which seems genuine.

But here's where I get stuck: I've also read that some people who lie *overcompensate* with extra eye contact and nodding to seem trustworthy. So maybe that's exactly what's happening here—trying too hard to look sincere. The blinking could just be nerves from being on camera, though, not necessarily deception. Like, I get that way myself when I'm being recorded, even when I'm telling the truth. And the fact that they're not doing *anything* else weird—no lip biting, no awkward pauses—makes it feel less like a lie. It just feels like someone who's a bit anxious but being straightforward. 

Honestly, I'm not sure. The blinking is the only thing that makes me lean toward "maybe lying," but the eye contact and nodding make me doubt it. If I had to guess, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'd be really uneasy about it. It's the kind of thing where if I saw it once, I'd want to hear more context or see them in a different situation before I'd feel confident. Like, it's not *clearly* a lie, but it's not totally innocent either. I think I'd keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions.

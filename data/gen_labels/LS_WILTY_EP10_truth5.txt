Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though it's really hard to say for certain. They're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty, not deception. Their head is tilted slightly and they're looking sideways at times, but that just seems like natural engagement—like they're really listening or thinking about what they're saying, not avoiding eye contact like some might associate with lying.  

That said, there are some things that make me pause. Their lips are pulled back (retracted) and the corners are down, which often shows tension or discomfort—like they might be stressed about the topic, not necessarily lying. And they're blinking a lot, which people sometimes point to as a "lie sign," though I know that's not super reliable; it could just be nervous energy or even dry eyes. Their chin moves up and down a bit too, which feels like subtle fidgeting, but again, that could just be them processing thoughts.  

I keep wondering if the lip tension is making me second-guess. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs like forced smiles or avoiding eye contact entirely—but they're not doing that. The raised eyebrows and head tilting actually seem like they're genuinely reacting to something, maybe even surprised by a question. It’s possible they’re just a little anxious about the situation, not lying. But then again, some people get really tense when they’re hiding something, so I can’t rule that out entirely.  

Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think the cues point to them being truthful—especially the steady gaze and head movements that feel engaged. But I wouldn’t bet money on it. It’s one of those cases where the behavior is ambiguous enough that it could go either way, depending on context. If I had to guess, I’d say truth, but I’d want to see more of the conversation before I was sure.

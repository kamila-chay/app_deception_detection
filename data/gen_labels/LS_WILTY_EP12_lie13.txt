Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to the whole time—which usually makes me lean toward them being honest, since liars often avoid direct gaze. But they're also blinking really frequently, which I've heard can be a sign of stress or discomfort. I wonder if they're just nervous about the situation—maybe they're being interviewed about something personal or they're not used to being on camera. The sideways glances they make might just be them looking at something in the room or just naturally shifting their focus while thinking, not necessarily because they're lying. 

On the flip side, the frequent blinking *could* point to deception, especially if they're trying to hide something. But I keep thinking: why would they look directly at the other person while doing it? If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance of eye contact, like looking down or away consistently. Instead, they're glancing sideways *while still mostly looking at the interlocutor*—that feels more like distraction or overthinking than deliberate deception. There's no fidgeting, no fake smiles, no awkward pauses, which are all things I'd watch for if I suspected lying. 

I'm not totally sure though. Maybe they're just a naturally fast-blinker, or maybe they're genuinely anxious about the topic. It's hard to tell without knowing the context—like, what are they even talking about? If it's a high-pressure question, the blinking might be stress from that, not lying. But if it's a simple question they're avoiding, it could be something else. Honestly, I'd probably say they seem more like they're just nervous than deceptive, but I'm not 100% certain. It's the kind of thing where you'd need to see more of the conversation to be sure.

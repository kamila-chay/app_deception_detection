Looking at the clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'm leaning toward them possibly not being entirely truthful. The way they're smiling and raising their eyebrows feels a bit... off, like they're trying too hard to seem friendly or engaged. Especially that exaggerated eye opening—they kept doing it a lot, like they were widening their eyes way more than normal during the conversation. I've heard that when people lie, they sometimes overdo expressions to seem sincere, so that stood out to me. And their lip corners were consistently pulled up in a smile, even when the topic seemed a bit serious, which made me wonder if it was forced.

But honestly, I'm second-guessing myself because there are other things that seem like they'd point to truthfulness. They kept making direct eye contact with the person they were talking to, and they were nodding along like they were really listening—those usually feel like signs of someone being honest, not deceptive. Also, they didn't seem nervous at all: no fidgeting, no blinking a lot, no awkward pauses where they'd stop talking. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those "nervous" signs, right? Like, people who are faking it often seem tense, but this person seemed calm and even a bit animated.

The tricky part is that some people just naturally smile a lot or have expressive eyes—they might be genuinely excited or just a very expressive person. Maybe they're not lying, but just really invested in the conversation. And the lack of other "deception markers" (like avoiding eye contact or covering their mouth) makes me think it could be a false alarm. But then again, I've read that skilled liars *don't* show those obvious signs—they just seem too smooth. So maybe the exaggerated eyes and forced smile are exactly what they'd do to seem convincing.

I guess I'm torn. On one hand, the over-the-top eye stuff feels suspicious. On the other, the steady eye contact and nodding don't fit the classic "liar" profile. If I had to guess without knowing the context, I'd say it's ambiguous—but if I had to lean toward one, I'd say maybe deception, just because the exaggerated expressions feel unnatural for how they're acting otherwise. But I'd be really hesitant to say for sure. It's so easy to misread this stuff—people are complicated, and video alone doesn't tell the whole story.

Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. While they are smiling and maintaining eye contact with a natural head tilt, which can indicate engagement and friendliness, these behaviors can also be deliberately used to mask deception. The smile seems calm and genuine at first glance, but sometimes liars smile to appear relaxed and trustworthy, using social cues strategically. The steady eye contact might not necessarily be a sign of truthfulness; it could be an intentional effort to avoid suspicion rather than a reflection of honesty. The absence of more obvious nervous signs, like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, might suggest they are skilled at concealing their true feelings rather than genuinely truthful. Given these observations, although I can't be completely certain, I tend to suspect that there is some deception involved here.

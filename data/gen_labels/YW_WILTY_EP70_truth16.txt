Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from watching, but here's how I'm reading it. The person seems pretty composed overall—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which usually feels more natural when someone's being truthful. They're also looking up a lot while speaking (gaze up), and I've heard that people often look up when they're recalling actual memories, not making things up. That feels like a good sign.  

But then there are a few things that make me pause. They're raising their eyebrows a lot, which can sometimes signal hesitation or skepticism—like they're questioning themselves or the question being asked. And they're blinking really frequently, which people often do when they're nervous. I know blinking alone isn't a solid tell, but paired with the eyebrow thing, it makes me wonder if they're stressed about the situation, even if they're not lying.  

The arms folded is another one—I see that a lot when people are just comfortable or thinking, but sometimes it's seen as defensive. Still, it doesn't scream "lying" to me. They're not avoiding eye contact, not fidgeting, not smiling awkwardly—those are the classic "lie" cues I'd expect to see if they were being deceptive, but they're missing.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, I'd expect more of those nervous habits, like avoiding gaze or fidgeting. The fact that they're holding eye contact while looking up actually leans toward truthfulness. Maybe the frequent blinking is just them being tired or focused, and the raised eyebrows are just their natural expression when they're concentrating.  

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I can't be 100% sure. The cues are mixed—some might point to nervousness, but the overall calmness and eye contact feel more like someone who's just being honest but maybe a bit stressed about the situation. It's not a clear "lie" to me, but it's not a slam-dunk "truth" either. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to see more context to be confident.

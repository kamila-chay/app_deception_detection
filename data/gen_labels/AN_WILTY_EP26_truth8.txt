Hmm, looking at the video, it's a bit tricky to say for sure, but I'm leaning toward them telling the truth based on what I'm seeing. The way they're holding their gaze directly at the person they're talking to feels natural—like they're engaged and not avoiding eye contact, which often happens when people are being deceptive. And those palms up? That's a big one for me. When people genuinely open their hands like that, it usually signals honesty or openness, not the kind of nervous gesture you'd see if they were lying. Plus, they don't have any of those classic "tells" like fidgeting, forced smiles, or looking away a lot—no raised eyebrows, no lip biting, nothing. It just seems calm and steady.

But I can see why someone might question it too. That head shaking is a bit confusing. If they're shaking their head while saying something, it might look like they're disagreeing or trying to emphasize a point, which could feel off if it's not matching their words. Like, if they're saying "I didn't do it" while shaking their head "no," it might seem contradictory at first glance. I wonder if it's just a natural habit of theirs, though—some people shake their head while they're talking, even when they're being truthful. And the chin moving up? That could just be a subtle way they're leaning in to listen or stress a point, not necessarily a sign of deception. 

Honestly, the lack of nervous energy really stands out to me. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little involuntary signs—like biting their lip or avoiding eye contact—but here, everything feels... relaxed? Like they're just speaking plainly. The head shake is the only thing that gives me a tiny pause, but it doesn't feel like a strong enough clue to override the rest. I mean, people lie with calm faces all the time, but this just doesn't *feel* like that. It’s not perfect, but based on what I’m seeing, I’d probably say truth. Still, I’d want to watch it again to be sure—sometimes those head movements can be tricky.

Hmm, this is tricky. So I'm watching this clip, and the person seems pretty calm at first glance. They're looking directly at whoever's asking them the question—no avoiding eye contact, which is interesting because I've heard some people say liars look away, but I know that's not always true. They've got their arms wide open, like they're not hiding anything, which usually feels like openness. But then... their eyebrows are raised *a lot*, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem extra sincere. I've seen that before when people are nervous about what they're saying, like they're overcompensating.  

On the other hand, if they were telling the truth, why would they raise their eyebrows so much? Maybe they genuinely didn't expect the question, or they're just a naturally expressive person. The arms open also feels like it could be a sign of honesty—like they're trying to show they're not hiding anything. But then again, sometimes people do that *when* they're lying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure.  

The thing that sticks with me is that they don't have any other obvious signs of stress—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles. But the eyebrow thing... it feels a little forced. Like they're trying to "act" calm, but the eyebrows give it away. I mean, if they were relaxed and truthful, their eyebrows might just be neutral, right? But they're stuck up high the whole time.  

Still, I could be wrong. Maybe they're just really into the conversation, or maybe they have a habit of raising their eyebrows when they're thinking. Without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to tell. If they were lying about something small, like "Did you eat the last cookie?" the eyebrows might not mean much. But if it's something serious, like "Did you see the accident?" then it feels more suspicious.  

Honestly? I'm leaning toward deception just because of that eyebrow thing combined with the lack of other nervous habits. But I'm not 100% sure—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more confident. It's not a clear-cut "liar" moment, but it's enough to make me pause and wonder. Like, "Hmm, they seem too calm, but why are their eyebrows doing that?" Yeah, I'd probably say they're probably not telling the full truth, but I'd still be second-guessing it.

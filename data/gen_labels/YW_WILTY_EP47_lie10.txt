Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I keep circling back to why that feels a bit off. They're maintaining steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which is interesting because I've heard that avoiding eye contact is a common deception cue. Here, they're actually looking right at the interlocutor the whole time, and they're nodding along like they're genuinely following the conversation. That feels more like someone engaged and sincere, not someone trying to cover up something. 

But then there's the raised eyebrows—they happen a few times, especially when answering certain questions. I've read that raised eyebrows can sometimes signal hesitation or even skepticism, not just surprise. Maybe they're unconsciously doubting their own answer? Or maybe they're just trying to seem attentive, like they're emphasizing points. It’s hard to tell if that’s a red flag or just natural expression. 

The thing that really stands out is how *calm* they seem. No fidgeting, no lip-biting, no awkward pauses—they’re speaking smoothly with their mouth closed but not forced. If they were lying, I’d expect more nervous tells, like touching their face or blinking a lot, but none of that’s happening. Still, I know some people are really good at hiding deception—they might be practiced or just naturally unflappable. 

On the flip side, maybe the lack of any nervousness *is* the clue. If someone’s lying and they’re *too* composed, it could feel unnatural. But honestly, the way they’re nodding and holding eye contact seems genuine to me. It’s not like they’re overdoing it to seem convincing—it feels relaxed. I guess I’m torn because the classic signs of lying aren’t there, but I’m also aware that deception can look like normal behavior. I’d say it’s more likely they’re being truthful, but I’d need more context to be sure. It’s tricky—sometimes the quietest people are the ones hiding something, but this doesn’t *feel* like that.

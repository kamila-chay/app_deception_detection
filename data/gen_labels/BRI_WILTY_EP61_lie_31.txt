Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because the only thing that stands out to me is that they keep raising their eyebrows—like, really lifting them up, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem extra attentive. On the one hand, I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes be a sign of deception, like when someone's stressed or trying to appear innocent while lying. It feels a little forced, especially since they don't do anything else that screams "I'm hiding something," like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. But then again, I've seen people raise their eyebrows all the time when they're just genuinely confused or listening closely to a question—maybe they're trying to process what's being asked, not necessarily lying.  

The thing is, there's no other obvious signs here. They're not blinking a lot, not smiling nervously, not fidgeting with their hands, and they're not avoiding eye contact at all. If this were a classic "lying" moment, I'd expect more of those little stress cues, but it's really just the eyebrows. It could also be that they're just a naturally expressive person—some folks do that as a habit, especially if they're used to engaging with others. Without knowing what they're actually saying or the context of the conversation, it's hard to tell if the eyebrow raise is a reaction to a question they're uncomfortable with, or just how they talk.  

I'm leaning a little toward deception just because of that repeated eyebrow lift—it feels a bit too deliberate for a casual conversation—but I'm not at all sure. It could easily be a red herring. Like, maybe they're just really trying to understand the question, or it's a cultural thing they do when they're listening. I'd want to see more of the video, or hear what they're saying, before I'd feel confident about this. Right now, it's one of those moments where it's almost too ambiguous to call either way.

This situation feels a bit ambiguous, but leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive. They do maintain consistent eye contact and open body language, which typically suggests honesty. However, those brief glances downward stand out—they seem like moments of avoidance rather than natural pauses, which can sometimes be a sign of lying. The nodding and wide gestures might actually be an attempt to appear sincere, almost as if they're overcompensating because they're nervous or trying to convince. The absence of more obvious nervous habits like fidgeting or forced smiles makes it less clear, but sometimes skilled deceivers can mask those signs. Overall, while the open posture suggests truthfulness, the subtle cues like the downward glances and possibly exaggerated gestures make me lean slightly toward thinking they might not be fully truthful. Without further context or information, though, it’s hard to be certain.

Hmm, this is tricky. From what I can see in the video, the person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels intentional. They're nodding along a lot, and their arms are open wide, which usually reads as receptive or honest. But there's this one thing that sticks out: they keep glancing down, like they're avoiding eye contact for a second here and there. I've heard that sometimes people look down when they're lying, but I also know that can happen when someone's just thinking or feeling uncomfortable, not necessarily being deceptive.  

On the flip side, the fact that they're nodding and keeping their arms open makes me wonder if they're trying *too* hard to seem genuine—like maybe they're nervous about being accused of lying, so they're overcompensating with all that nodding and open posture. But then again, the lack of other classic "deception tells" is confusing. No fidgeting, no fake smiles, no weird blinking... it's almost too calm for someone who's lying. If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy, like fiddling with their hands or avoiding eye contact completely.  

Honestly, though, I'm not sure. People get really good at hiding lies, or maybe they're just naturally reserved and the down-glances are just them processing what they're saying. I'd lean toward them being truthful because the open body language feels genuine, but I can't rule out the down-glances as a red flag. It's one of those cases where without more context—like what they're even talking about—it's really hard to tell. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd feel confident.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest. Their eyes don't really meet the person they're talking to—they keep looking down or off to the side, which makes me wonder if they're avoiding eye contact because they're lying. But then I notice they're not doing any of the classic "tells" people often associate with lying: no frowning, no weird blinking, no touching their face or hands, no awkward pauses. They seem pretty calm overall. 

If they were lying, I'd expect them to be a bit more tense—maybe shifting in their seat or fidgeting—but they're just sitting there with that steady gaze down and sideways. It feels more like they're just not super comfortable making eye contact, maybe because they're shy or just focused on what they're saying. Like, sometimes people naturally look away when they're thinking or being thoughtful, not necessarily hiding something. 

But I'm not totally sure. Could they be lying *and* just really good at staying calm? Maybe. Some people don't show physical signs of lying at all. Or maybe they're just used to the camera and don't like staring at people. The fact that they're not doing anything *extra*—like forced smiles or nervous gestures—makes me lean toward them being honest. It doesn't feel like they're trying to hide anything; it feels like they're just... being themselves while they talk. 

Honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up, but the lack of stress cues makes me think they're probably telling the truth. I wouldn't bet money on it, but based on what I see, it seems like they're not lying.

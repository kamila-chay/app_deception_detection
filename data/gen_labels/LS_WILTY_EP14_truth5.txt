Watching this clip, I'm honestly a bit torn on whether they're being truthful. On one hand, they've got that constant raised eyebrow thing going on and are blinking way more than usual—like, I'd notice that even if I wasn't looking for it. That kind of nervous energy often makes people think someone's hiding something, especially since people tend to over-blink when they're stressed or lying. And the way they're crossing their fingers while talking? That's the kind of habit I'd associate with someone trying to "hope" they're not caught in a lie. 

But then there's the arms being open and their gaze staying fixed on the person they're talking to—no looking away or down, which usually happens when someone's making things up. The head touching seems like they're just thinking hard, not necessarily being deceptive. And honestly, the open arms feel like a sign they're trying to seem approachable, not defensive. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect them to cross their arms or look away more. 

Still, I can't shake that frequent blinking. It *could* just be they're tired or the lighting's bothering their eyes. And maybe the finger-crossing is just a nervous tic, not a "lie signal." Without hearing what they're actually saying, it's hard to tell if the nervousness is about the topic or just the camera. I'd lean toward them being truthful because the openness in their posture and eye contact feels more consistent with honesty, but I'm not 100% sure—nervousness can look like lying even when it's not. It's one of those cases where the cues kind of cancel each other out.

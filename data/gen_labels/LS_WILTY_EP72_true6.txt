Honestly, I'm not 100% certain, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—not because it's obvious, but because the cues seem to align more with genuine engagement than deception. The person has their gaze directed right at the person they're talking to, and they're looking up occasionally, which often happens when someone's recalling something or being thoughtful, not when they're fabricating. I also notice they're raising their eyebrows a few times while listening, which feels more like surprise or active processing than nervousness. And their chin is moving upward slightly—like they're holding their head up with some confidence or focus—without any of the classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiles.  

That said, I can see why someone might question it. Raised eyebrows can sometimes signal skepticism or even deception in certain contexts, especially if they're paired with other cues like averted gaze, but here their eyes stay on the speaker, which weakens that angle. The chin movement upward might also be misread as defensiveness, but it doesn't feel aggressive—it's subtle, almost like they're leaning in to listen. And the absence of things like rapid blinking or lip movements (which people often do when lying) really stands out; if they were making it up, I'd expect more of those nervous tells.  

But I won't pretend it's a slam dunk. Gaze up *can* be a lie indicator for some people, and the eyebrow raises *might* just be a habit. Maybe they're just naturally expressive, or maybe they're genuinely surprised by what they're saying. Without more context—like the topic or their usual behavior—it's hard to be sure. Honestly, I'd say the weight of what I'm seeing points toward truth, but I'd still want to hear the full context before I'd feel completely confident. It’s the lack of red flags that makes me think it’s likely true, not any single "proof" of honesty.

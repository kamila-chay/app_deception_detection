Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty calm and engaged while talking. They're smiling consistently, which usually feels like a natural reaction to being comfortable or being truthful—especially since there's no sign of them frowning, looking away, or fidgeting. The way they're holding their head steady and not doing any of those little nervous gestures people sometimes do when they're lying, like touching their face or rubbing their hands, makes it feel like they're not stressed about what they're saying. The smile doesn't look forced to me—it's relaxed, and they're making eye contact without darting around, which usually aligns with being honest.  

But honestly, it's tricky to say for sure. I know some people fake smiles when they're lying to seem friendly, so that smile could just be a cover. Maybe they're just really good at staying calm under pressure, or they've rehearsed their answer so much it feels natural. The absence of classic "lying" signs like avoiding eye contact or excessive blinking is definitely leaning toward truth, but I've also heard that some habitual liars don't show those signs at all—they're just practiced. And since I don't know what they're actually talking about, it's hard to tell if the topic would make someone nervous. If they were denying something big, like a crime, a calm smile might actually be more suspicious, but if it's a simple "yes" to a harmless question, it probably is just genuine.  

All in all, the lack of stress cues and the consistent, relaxed smile makes me lean toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like the kind of behavior where if they *were* lying, they'd be doing a really good job of hiding it—which is possible, but the video doesn't give me any red flags. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but it's definitely not a slam dunk. Like, if I had to put a number on it, maybe 60-70% truth? But I'd want to hear the actual question and answer to feel more confident.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, honestly. I can see the person isn't smiling, laughing, or frowning much—which is interesting because if they were lying, I'd expect maybe more forced expressions or signs of stress. But then they're looking sideways a lot, and their head is tilting and moving back a bit. I've read that people sometimes look sideways when they're recalling something or thinking, not necessarily lying—like when they're trying to remember a detail. But I've also heard that avoiding direct eye contact *can* be a sign of deception, so that sideways gaze makes me pause.  

On the other hand, they're not fidgeting, rubbing their hands, or avoiding eye contact completely (they're not *looking* at the person, but they're not ducking their head either). The head tilting actually seems kind of relaxed or curious, like they're listening intently, not nervous. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "stress" tells—like shaky hands or a tight jaw—but none of that's happening here. The lack of those signs makes me think they might actually be calm, which could mean they're telling the truth.  

But I'm not sure. Maybe the sideways look is just their normal way of talking, or maybe they're uncomfortable in general, not necessarily lying. And the head moving back... could that be a nervous habit? It's hard to say without more context. Honestly, the video doesn't scream "liar" to me, but it also doesn't scream "truth" super clearly. The absence of obvious stress cues feels more telling than the sideways gaze alone. I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because they seem so... unflustered? But I wouldn't bet money on it. It's just a gut feeling based on what I'm seeing.

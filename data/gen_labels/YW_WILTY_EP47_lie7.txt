Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn about whether this person is lying or not. On one hand, the head shaking stands out—every time they respond, they shake their head side-to-side, almost like a quick "no" even when the question might not call for it. That feels a little off, especially since it's not just a casual nod but a deliberate, repeated motion. And then there's that exaggerated eye closing—they shut their eyes really tight for a second while speaking, which isn't something I see people do naturally when they're just answering a question. It almost looks like they're trying to "block out" the moment, which sometimes happens when someone's preparing a story.  

But here's why I'm not sure: they're actually looking directly at the person asking the question most of the time, which feels like a sign of honesty—people who lie often look away more. And their gaze flickering sideways? Could just mean they're thinking or processing, not necessarily hiding something. Also, they're not fidgeting, not smiling unnaturally, and there's no awkward silence—those are usually bigger red flags for deception. Maybe they're just nervous about the question, and the head shake and eye closing are just their way of reacting to stress, not deception.  

I keep circling back to the eye closing though—it's so exaggerated. If they were telling the truth, why would they do that? But then again, I've seen people do weird little tics when they're trying to sound calm. Like, maybe they're just tired or have an eye thing. And the head shaking... could be a habit, or maybe they're disagreeing with themselves internally without meaning to.  

Honestly, I'd lean toward *maybe* deception because of those two cues, but I'm not confident at all. It's easy to misread nervousness as lying, and this could just be someone who's anxious about the situation. If I had to guess without knowing the context, I'd say it's ambiguous—there's enough to raise a question, but not enough to say for sure. I'd want to hear the actual question and answer before I'd feel comfortable calling it a lie.

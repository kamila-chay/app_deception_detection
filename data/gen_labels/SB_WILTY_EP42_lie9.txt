Looking at this clip, I'm a bit torn on whether they're lying or not. Honestly, it's hard to tell just from body language alone, but there are some things that stick out. They seem really tense—like, their eyes kept darting down and they were blinking way more than usual, which I've heard can signal stress or discomfort. Their eyebrows were raised a lot, almost like they were surprised, but that felt off because they weren't smiling or laughing. And when they talked, their chin kept moving downward, like they were pulling it in, and their head tilted sideways a bit while they leaned back a little. It's not the typical "I'm being honest" vibe—usually, people who are relaxed might lean in or keep steady eye contact, but here they seemed to be creating a bit of space, like they were trying to distance themselves. The arms being open could be a red herring though; sometimes people do that to seem friendly, even when they're nervous.  

But then I keep thinking, maybe they're just naturally fidgety or really anxious about being on camera. I've seen people with dry eyes blink a ton, or they might just be thinking hard about what to say—like, if they're recalling something, they might look down. The fact that they were still making eye contact (gaze toward the interlocutor) makes me wonder if they're trying to seem sincere, which could actually be a sign they're nervous about being caught. Still, the frequent blinking and head movements feel too consistent to just be coincidence.  

On the flip side, if they were lying, you'd expect more obvious signs like avoiding eye contact entirely or smiling to soften the lie, but they didn't do any of that. They were actually pretty still otherwise—no lip movements or hand gestures. That makes me question it a bit. Maybe they're just a quiet person who gets flustered easily, and the stress is making them act like this, not because they're deceiving anyone.  

Honestly, I'd lean toward deception based on the blinking, the chin movement, and the way they seemed to pull back physically, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. People are complicated, and without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's easy to misread. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's not a slam dunk. It just feels like they're not fully at ease, which often happens when someone's holding something back. But yeah, I'm not 100% sure—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying to be more confident.

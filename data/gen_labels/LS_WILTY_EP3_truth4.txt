Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not based on what I'm seeing. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because some of the cues seem mixed. On one hand, they're keeping their arms open, which usually feels like someone being genuine or open to the conversation—like they're not trying to shut anyone out. And they're actually looking toward the person they're talking to, which is a good sign; liars often avoid direct eye contact, but here they're not doing that. The head tilting and side-turning also seem like they're engaged, maybe even a bit curious, which doesn't scream "lying" to me.

But then there's the frequent blinking and the lip corners pulled down—those feel a little off. I've seen people blink a lot when they're stressed or trying to think, which could happen even when telling the truth, like if they're recalling something hard. And the lip corners down might just mean they're concentrating or feeling a bit uneasy about the question, not necessarily lying. The chin moving up too—like they're trying to hold it together—could be nervousness, but again, I've been nervous while being honest before. 

I keep going back to the arms being open and the gaze toward the person as the strongest points. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of defensiveness—like crossing arms or avoiding eye contact—but they're not doing any of that. The raised eyebrows and gaze down might make me pause for a second, but those could just be natural reactions to being asked a question, not deliberate deception. Like, maybe they're thinking hard or feeling a bit uncomfortable about the topic, but that doesn't automatically mean they're lying. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the lack of classic "lie tells" (like covering their mouth or fidgeting with hands) is confusing. Most people I've seen lie tend to have *some* physical tells, but here it's mostly subtle stuff like blinking. Still, I know people can be really good at hiding it, so I can't rule it out entirely. But overall, the openness and engagement feel more consistent with someone being truthful than deceptive. It's not 100% clear-cut—human behavior is messy—but based on what I'm seeing, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. It just doesn't *feel* like the nervous, guarded energy I'd expect from someone lying.

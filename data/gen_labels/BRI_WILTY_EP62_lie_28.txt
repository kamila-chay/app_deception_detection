Looking at the video, the person seems really calm and composed the whole time—no obvious fidgeting, no shifting in their seat, and they're not making any sudden movements or facial expressions. They're just sitting there, speaking directly to the camera with a neutral expression, and their eyes stay mostly steady on the camera. Honestly, it’s kind of hard to tell if they’re lying because they don’t seem nervous at all. Most of the time, when people are deceptive, they might avoid eye contact, fiddle with their hands, or seem tense, but here they’re the opposite: relaxed and steady. That makes me lean toward thinking they might be telling the truth, just because their body language doesn’t match what I’d expect from someone hiding something.

But then I think, maybe they’re just really good at hiding it? Like, some people practice lying so much that they don’t show any physical tells—they might even be trying *too* hard to seem calm. Or maybe the situation itself is just not stressful for them, so they’re genuinely relaxed regardless of whether they’re being truthful. I mean, if I were in a room with someone who seemed this collected while answering a tough question, I’d probably assume they were being honest, but I’d also wonder if there’s more context I’m missing—like, what exactly are they being asked about? If the question was super easy or they’d rehearsed their answer, that could explain the lack of nervousness too. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the absence of tells might actually be suspicious in a way—like, why isn’t there *any* reaction? But I don’t think that’s how it usually works. Most people don’t have zero physical responses when lying, so maybe the lack of movement is a good sign. Still, I can’t be 100% sure. I’d probably want to hear the actual content of what they’re saying or see how they react to follow-up questions before I’d feel confident either way. Right now, based just on the video, I’d say it *looks* like they’re being truthful, but I’d hesitate to call it a definite "no lie" because deception can be subtle. It’s just... really quiet, and that’s making it hard to read.

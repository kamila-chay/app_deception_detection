Watching the clip, the person seems to be frowning quite noticeably—like they're genuinely troubled or confused by whatever they're saying. I don't see any other classic "lie signs" jumping out at me: no awkward pauses, no fidgeting with their hands, no avoiding eye contact (though they're not really looking at the camera either, just kind of staring off to the side), and definitely no nervous laughter or forced smiles. In fact, they seem pretty still, which makes me think they're not trying to hide anything. Most people who are lying tend to have more physical tells—like touching their face, blinking a lot, or shifting around—but here, they're just sitting there with that frown, like they're actually processing the question.  

But honestly, I'm not totally sure. Frowning alone could mean a lot of things—not just lying. Maybe they're just frustrated with the question, or genuinely upset about the topic, or even just have a habit of frowning when they're concentrating. I've seen people frown while being completely truthful, especially if they're trying to remember something or feel uncomfortable. And since they're not doing anything else that screams "deception," like crossing arms or avoiding the camera, it feels more like they're just... annoyed or thoughtful, not deceptive.  

Still, I can see why someone might second-guess it. If I were just judging on the frown alone, I might wonder if it's a sign of guilt, but the rest of their behavior doesn't back that up. Like, if they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—maybe more blinking or shifting, but there's none of that. So yeah, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just... the frown feels like it's coming from a real emotion, not a performance. Maybe they're just having a bad day, and that's why they're scowling. Either way, the lack of other tells makes it feel more honest than not.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's really tricky to tell just from watching. On one hand, I noticed a lot of nervous habits that make me lean toward deception: their eyebrows were raised pretty consistently, like they were trying to seem surprised or maybe just stressed, and they blinked way more than normal, almost like they couldn't hold eye contact. The exaggerated eye closing too—like they were shutting out something uncomfortable—felt off, and that chin moving upward? That's not something I see often; it kind of looked like they were trying to appear tough or defensive while answering. Plus, the head tilting and side-turning made them seem a bit distracted, like they were searching for words instead of being fully present.  

But then there's the other side: they kept making direct eye contact with the person they were talking to, which usually suggests honesty, and they were nodding along like they were genuinely engaging. Their arms were open the whole time, which feels welcoming, not closed-off like someone trying to hide something. And they didn't fidget with their hands or avoid the question—no rubbing, scratching, or covering their mouth, which are common signs of lying. Honestly, the open arms and steady gaze make me wonder if the nervousness was just from being in an awkward situation, not necessarily lying. Maybe they're just a naturally anxious person, or the question was really tough, and the "deception" cues are just their default behavior when stressed.  

I guess I'm split. The blinking and raised brows are red flags, but the engagement and open posture are counter-signs. If I had to guess, I'd say *maybe* they're not being completely truthful, but it's so ambiguous—could easily be a nervous truth-teller. I'd want to hear more context before I'd feel confident either way. It's one of those cases where the video doesn't give me a clear answer, just a lot of "hmm, I'm not sure."

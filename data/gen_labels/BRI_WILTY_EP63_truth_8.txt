Honestly, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure it out, but I'm not 100% sure either way. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious fidgeting, no nervous blinking, and they're not trying to cover their mouth or look away a lot. That *feels* like it might lean toward truth because when people are lying, they often show more physical tension, like touching their face or avoiding eye contact. Here, they're actually looking *up* a bit, which I've read can sometimes happen when people are recalling real memories, not making things up. They also have their lips slightly pushed out, which I think some people do when they're concentrating on what they're saying, not necessarily lying.

But then, I keep thinking—maybe they're just a really calm person, or maybe they're good at hiding it. I've heard that some people who lie don't show the classic "signs" because they're practiced or just not nervous. Like, the fact that they're not smiling or frowning could just mean they're being neutral, not that they're truthful. And that "lips protruded" thing... I'm not even sure if that's a big clue—I've seen people do that while just thinking, not lying. It's possible they're just naturally expressive with their mouth.

Also, the lack of "gaze towards interlocutor" is interesting. If they were lying, you'd think they might avoid eye contact, but they're looking up instead. That doesn't *feel* like a liar's behavior to me, but I know it's not a hard rule. Truth-tellers sometimes look up too when they're remembering something. Honestly, the more I watch, the more the *absence* of nervous cues stands out to me—no twitching, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles. That makes me lean toward "truth," but I'm still not confident. It's possible they're just really good at controlling themselves, or maybe they're not lying but they're just... not very animated. I'd say it's more likely they're telling the truth based on what I'm seeing, but I'd need more context to be sure. Like, if they were describing something specific and it matched what I already know, that'd help. Without that, it's just this quiet, steady delivery that doesn't scream "lie" to me. But yeah, I'm not ruling out the other possibility either. It's just... the way they're sitting there, not reacting much, feels like they're just telling the story they know.

Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The way they're moving their head a lot—shaking it "no," tilting it sideways, and leaning forward while looking down and sideways—makes me pause. On one hand, the head shaking and side-turning feel like natural reactions to denying something, which could fit with someone being honest about not doing whatever they're being asked about. The exaggerated mouth opening when they're speaking also seems like they're emphasizing their point, maybe trying to make sure they're clear, which often happens when people are being genuine. Their chin moving down and gaze shifting away from the camera might just mean they're thinking hard or feeling a bit uncomfortable, not necessarily lying—lots of people look down when they're processing a question, even if they're telling the truth.  

But then there's the frowning eyebrows and raised eyebrows together, which feels a bit tense. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely, but they're actually looking at the person they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor) while still glancing down and sideways. That mixed gaze makes me wonder—sometimes liars look away to avoid detection, but others do it when they're trying to remember the truth. The lack of smiling or laughing stands out too; if they were being playful or trying to seem innocent, I might expect more of that, but they're dead serious.  

The thing that keeps me from being sure is how common these cues are in everyday conversation. That head movement forward and the chin going down could just be them getting emotionally invested in what they're saying, not hiding something. And head shaking "no" is pretty straightforward—if they're denying something, it fits. But I can't shake the thought that maybe the frowning and eyebrow raises are a subtle sign of stress, like they're worried about being caught in a lie. Still, the absence of classic "lie" tells (like lip biting, excessive blinking, or hands covering the face) makes me lean away from deception. Honestly, it feels more like someone who's being honest but maybe a bit frustrated or defensive about the situation. I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I'm not 100% certain—there's always room for doubt with body language, especially when it's not super extreme. It's not a clear-cut "lie" to me, but it's not a slam-dunk "truth" either.

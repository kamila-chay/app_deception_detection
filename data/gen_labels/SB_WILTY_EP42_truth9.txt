Okay, so I watched the clip, and honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up. Let me walk through what I saw because it's not super clear-cut. The person seems pretty engaged—they're making eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is a good sign for truthfulness, right? And they're nodding along while they speak, like they're really listening or agreeing with themselves. Their head's tilted slightly, which usually feels like they're trying to connect or be thoughtful, not like they're hiding something. They also keep looking up a bit while they talk, which I've heard can be a sign of thinking, but I'm not sure if that's linked to lying or just how people process things.

But then there are these little things that make me pause. They're blinking way more than usual—like, constantly. I've read that frequent blinking can be a stress response, and sometimes that's tied to lying, but honestly, I've also seen people blink a lot when they're just nervous about being on camera, not necessarily because they're being dishonest. And their chin... it kept moving downward, like they were pushing it down a bit, almost like they were trying to hold something in or seem more serious. That felt a little off, but it could just be a habit or a natural movement while they're concentrating.

Then there's the hand scratching—like, they kept scratching their arm or neck a few times. That's another one people point to as a "nervous tell," but I know that can happen if you're just itchy or fidgety for no reason. It doesn't *have* to mean they're lying. And the fact that they're not smiling or laughing at all? That's interesting. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more forced smiles or trying to seem friendly, but they just seem... calm? Or maybe just focused. It's hard to tell.

On the flip side, the truth-tellers I've seen sometimes act like this too—they're not overly animated, they make eye contact, they nod. The frequent blinking and the chin thing could just be them being a little anxious about the situation, not about the story they're telling. Like, maybe they're just not used to being recorded, or they're tired. I mean, I've definitely fidgeted like that when I was trying to remember something clearly, and I wasn't lying.

So yeah, I'm really not sure. The "nervous" signs are there, but they're not overwhelming, and the "truth" signs (eye contact, nodding, engagement) are pretty strong. It feels more like they're just a bit stressed about the moment rather than actively trying to deceive. But I can't rule out the possibility that the blinking and scratching are hiding something. It's the kind of thing where if I heard the actual words, I might feel more confident, but based on the body language alone? I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but I'd say it's a maybe. Like, they're probably not lying, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just... not screaming "lie" to me.

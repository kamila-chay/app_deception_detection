Looking at the video, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. They're making direct eye contact the whole time—gaze towards the interlocutor is true, so they're not avoiding looking at the person they're talking to, which usually leans toward truth-telling. They're nodding along and tilting their head a bit, which feels like they're genuinely engaged, not trying to fake it. But then there's this frown and raised eyebrows going on—like they're really concentrating or maybe even a little skeptical about what they're saying? That part makes me pause because sometimes people frown when they're lying, trying to "think" of a story.  

On the flip side, they're not doing any classic nervous tells: no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no hands fidgeting, no excessive blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect at least *some* of those signs, right? Like, people who are deceptive often have these little physical tells they can't control. Here, everything feels... calm, even with the frown. Maybe the frown is just them processing a hard question, not deception. And the head tilting and side-turning—those often happen when someone's listening or thinking, not when they're lying.  

I guess the biggest thing that makes me lean toward truth is how *consistent* their behavior is. They're not switching between open and closed body language, and the eye contact stays steady. If they were making something up, I'd expect more inconsistency—like glancing away when they say something specific. But here, it's all pretty smooth. Still, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe the frown is a red herring for something else entirely, like they're just tired or stressed about the topic.  

Honestly, after watching it a few times, I'd say it *feels* more like truth than lying, but I'm not gonna claim I know for sure. It's the lack of those nervous habits that sticks with me more than the frown. But yeah, it's one of those cases where you just have to go with the overall vibe—no glaring signs of deception, and the engagement feels real. So, my gut says truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd bet on it.

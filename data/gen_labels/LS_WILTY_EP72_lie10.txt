Watching the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful here. Honestly, it's tricky. What stands out to me is how they're shaking their head "no" a few times while talking—like they're really emphasizing that point. And they've got those eyebrows knitted together in a pretty tight frown the whole time, which feels... tense? Like they're concentrating hard on what they're saying, maybe even trying to convince themselves. Then there's the crossing fingers thing—they do it a couple times while answering, which I've noticed before can be a nervous habit, like they're trying to "cross their fingers" for luck or to feel better about what they're saying. Their eyes stay locked on the person they're talking to, which is interesting because sometimes people avoid eye contact when lying, but not always—maybe they're trying to seem honest by looking directly at them.

But wait, I'm second-guessing myself. That head shaking could just be a natural "no" to a question they're answering, not necessarily deception. Like, maybe they're saying "no, that didn't happen," and the head shake is just part of their speech rhythm. And the frowning... I've seen people frown when they're just trying to remember something or feel frustrated with the question, not because they're lying. The finger crossing might be totally unrelated—maybe they just have a habit of doing that when they talk, like twisting their ring or something. I mean, it's easy to read too much into small gestures, right?

Honestly, I'd lean toward them maybe not being fully truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. It feels like the combination of the tense frown, the head shake, and the finger crossing adds up to something off, but it's not a smoking gun. It could easily be them just being really serious or nervous about the topic. If I had to guess based on what I saw, I'd say it's possible they're lying, but it's also totally plausible they're just stressed or confused. Hard to say for sure without more context. I'd want to see more of the conversation to be confident.

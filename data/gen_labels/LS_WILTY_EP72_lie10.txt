Watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their repeated head shaking "no" seems a bit exaggerated, almost as if they're trying too hard to emphasize their point. The tightly knitted eyebrows create a sustained frown that feels more like tension or discomfort than simple concentration. The fact that they cross their fingers a couple of times while answering strikes me as a possible nervous gesture, something people sometimes do when they're uneasy or unsure about what they're saying. Their steady eye contact is interesting; while it can suggest honesty, it might also be a deliberate effort to appear trustworthy.

On the other hand, it’s worth considering that the head shake could just be a natural response to a negative question, and the frown might reflect frustration or concentration rather than deceit. The finger crossing could simply be a habitual gesture unrelated to the truthfulness of their statements. It’s easy to overinterpret small behavioral cues.

Still, taken together—the insistence of the head shake, the tense frown, and the finger crossing—I tend to suspect there’s something off about their account. While it’s not definitive proof of lying, these signs lean me toward thinking they might be stretching the truth or holding something back. Without more context, I can’t be certain, but my inclination is to view their behavior as suggestive of possible deception.

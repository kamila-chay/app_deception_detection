Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because some of the cues are mixed, but I'll walk through what stands out to me. First off, they had their palms up the whole time—that's usually a sign of openness, like they're not hiding anything, which feels like a good sign for truthfulness. And they kept making eye contact with whoever they were talking to, which also usually suggests engagement and honesty. But then there's this exaggerated eye opening they did a couple times—like their eyes got really wide—and raised eyebrows, which I've heard can sometimes be a sign of surprise or even overacting. I'm not sure if that's genuine excitement about what they're saying or if they're trying too hard to seem sincere.  

On the other hand, there's nothing that screams "lying" to me. No frowning, no awkward pauses, no avoiding eye contact entirely, and they weren't fidgeting with their hands or covering their mouth. Those are all classic red flags for deception, so the absence of those makes me lean toward them being honest. But I can see how someone might argue the opposite: maybe the raised eyebrows and wide eyes are a tell, like they're rehearsing a story and overdoing the "surprise" part to seem convincing. I've read that people who lie sometimes try to amplify expressions to seem more believable, so that could be a counterpoint.  

The gaze down thing is confusing me a little too—like, they were looking down occasionally while still facing the person. I've heard that people might glance down when they're thinking or being careful with their words, but since they were still engaging (gaze toward interlocutor), it doesn't feel like nervousness. It might just be how they naturally speak.  

All in all, I'm not 100% sure, but the lack of deception cues and the open palms make me think they're probably telling the truth. But I'd hesitate to say it's definite—like, maybe they're just really calm and expressive, or maybe I'm missing something subtle. It's hard to tell without more context, but based on what I see, I'd guess truth over deception, just because the positive signs outweigh the ambiguous ones.

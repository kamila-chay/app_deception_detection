Hmm, this is actually a bit tough to call just from the video alone. I'm watching someone who seems to be in a conversation, and what stands out most is how they're holding their gaze—they're definitely looking at the person they're talking to, which feels intentional, but then they keep glancing down a bit, like they're avoiding eye contact for a second before snapping back. Their eyebrows are raised pretty noticeably too, almost like they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical, but it doesn't quite match what they're saying.  

On one hand, if they were lying, those raised eyebrows and the down-glances might make sense—they could be nervous or trying to seem innocent while they're fabricating something. People often look away or tense up when they're not being truthful, and the raised brows might be a subconscious reaction to the stress of lying. The fact that they're not smiling or fidgeting much is interesting too; some liars try too hard to seem calm, so the lack of obvious "lie signs" might actually be a red flag.  

But then, on the flip side, maybe they're just naturally expressive. I've seen people raise their eyebrows when they're thinking hard or trying to process a question, not because they're lying. And glancing down? That could just be how they think—some people do that when they're concentrating or recalling details, whether they're telling the truth or not. They're not avoiding eye contact entirely, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something, and they're not doing anything like touching their face or scratching, which are more classic "nervous" tells.  

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The raised eyebrows are the thing that keeps bugging me—I keep wondering if it's a genuine reaction or a cover-up. But without knowing the context of what they're saying or how they usually act, it's easy to misread. If I had to guess based on what I see here, I'd lean toward them being truthful, just because the lack of other stress cues feels more consistent with someone being honest but maybe a bit cautious. But I'd be totally wrong if I'm missing something obvious, and I wouldn't bet my lunch money on it. It's one of those clips where you just have to hear the words to really tell.

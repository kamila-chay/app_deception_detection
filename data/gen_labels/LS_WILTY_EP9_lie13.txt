This is a bit complicated, but based on what I’m seeing, I tend to lean toward the idea that this person might be lying. They show signs of tension—no smiling, lots of raised eyebrows, and very frequent blinking—which could suggest nervousness tied to deception. The way they hold their chin stiffly and tilt their head back slightly seems like an attempt to create distance, which might be a subtle defensive gesture. 

They do maintain direct eye contact, which often is a sign of honesty, but that could just as well be them forcing it to appear truthful. The lack of typical nervous habits like fidgeting or fake smiles is somewhat unexpected if they were lying, but it could also mean they are particularly good at hiding it. When people are trying to construct a story or cover something up, these kinds of subtle stress signals often show up, even if more obvious tells don’t.

Of course, there’s always the possibility they’re just naturally anxious or stressed about whatever they’re discussing, and that could explain these behaviors without deception. Since I don’t know the full context, it’s hard to be sure. Still, given the combination of cues—especially the frequent blinking and chin tension—I find myself more inclined to think they might be hiding something rather than fully truthful. It’s not a confident conclusion, just a leaning in that direction based on the available signs.

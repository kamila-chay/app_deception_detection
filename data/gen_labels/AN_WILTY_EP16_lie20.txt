Watching the clip, my first thought is that this person seems pretty composed on the surface—they're making eye contact, smiling, and their head movements look natural. The way they're nodding their head side-to-side when they say "no" feels like a common gesture people use when denying something, almost like they're physically pushing the question away. And that little smile? It's there, but it doesn't feel forced—it's more like they're trying to seem friendly while answering, which honestly makes me wonder if they're just being polite or if they're actually hiding something.  

But then I keep circling back to the eye contact. They're looking right at the person asking the question the whole time, which usually leans toward truthfulness—liars often avoid direct gaze, right? And their head isn't darting around or looking down like someone who's nervous. The head shaking is definitely there, but I've seen people do that all the time without lying—like when they're just emphasizing a point.  

On the other hand, the smile is a bit of a red flag for me. When people are lying, they sometimes smile to seem relaxed, but it’s usually a bit stiff or doesn't reach their eyes. Here, it’s subtle, but it’s there *while* they’re saying something that feels like a direct denial. And the head tilting—like they’re weighing the question—could be genuine thought, but it also sometimes happens when someone’s trying to craft a response.  

Honestly, I’m torn. It’s hard to say for sure. The eye contact and calm posture lean toward "truthful," but the smile and head shake make me think they might be trying too hard to seem okay. Maybe they’re just nervous about the topic, not lying. I’d want to hear the actual question they’re answering to be more sure—like, if they’re denying something they *did* do, the cues might point one way, but if it’s a neutral question, it’s probably just them being polite.  

Right now, I’d lean toward *maybe* deception, but I wouldn’t bet money on it. People’s behavior is so context-dependent, and without knowing what they’re saying, it’s easy to misread. It feels like they’re trying to be convincing, but that could just be their natural way of speaking. I’d say it’s ambiguous—could go either way depending on what’s actually being discussed.

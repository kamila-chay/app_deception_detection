Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the behavior alone. Let me think through what I'm seeing. The person is definitely scowling and has furrowed eyebrows—that feels like they're really focused, maybe even a bit frustrated or stressed about what they're saying. But they're also looking directly at whoever's talking to them, which usually suggests they're trying to be honest or engaged, not avoiding eye contact like some might expect if they were lying. And their palms are up, which is a classic open-hand gesture people use when they're being truthful, right? Like they're not hiding anything.

But then there's the sideways glance and the head shaking. I've heard that when people look sideways, it can sometimes mean they're not fully present or might be thinking hard about what to say—like they're constructing a story. And head shaking... well, it could be a nervous tic, or maybe they're just disagreeing with something, but it doesn't feel like it's tied to the conversation in a way that screams "lying." The lip corners are up, but it's not a full smile—just a slight lift, which might mean they're trying to seem calm while they're actually tense. That mixed signal is confusing.

On the other hand, they're not doing any of the classic "lie" tells: no frequent blinking, no lip biting, no hands covering their face or rubbing their neck. Those are usually red flags, so their lack of those might actually point toward truth. And the direct gaze toward the person they're talking to feels more like they're trying to connect or be clear, not like they're dodging.

I guess the biggest question is why they're scowling. Maybe they're upset about the question being asked, not about lying. Like, if someone's accusing them of something they didn't do, they might scowl out of frustration but still be telling the truth. The sideways glance might just be them processing what they're saying, not hiding something. I'm leaning toward truth because of the open palms and direct eye contact, but I'm not 100% sure—the scowl and sideways look are making me second-guess a bit. It's hard to say without knowing the context of the conversation, but based on the cues alone, it feels more like they're being honest but annoyed, not deceptive. Still, I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's one of those cases where the behavior is a little messy, so I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel confident.

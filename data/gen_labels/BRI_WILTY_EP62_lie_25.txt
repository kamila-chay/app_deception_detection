Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but after watching the clip a couple times, I don't see any obvious signs that would make me think they're lying—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that nervous energy people sometimes show. They're just sitting there calmly, not blinking a lot, not shifting in their seat, and their face looks pretty neutral the whole time. It's almost like they're really relaxed, which makes me wonder if they're being truthful because they don't seem stressed. But then I keep thinking, *wait, what if they're just really good at hiding it?* I've heard that some people who lie a lot can control their body language so well that they don't give themselves away, especially if they're practiced or not even nervous about getting caught.  

On the other hand, if they were telling the truth, it makes sense they wouldn't have those little tells—like if they're just answering a straightforward question about something they actually did, they wouldn't need to fake anything. But then again, truth-tellers can get nervous too, right? So the fact that they're calm *could* mean they're lying, or it could mean they're just chill. I guess the thing that's throwing me off is that the video feels... empty? Like, no micro-expressions, no awkward pauses—just steady. But I know from what I've read that absence of those signs doesn't prove honesty. It's like trying to read a book with no punctuation; it's hard to tell if the silence means "I'm telling the truth" or "I'm not even trying to hide it."  

Honestly, I'd probably need to hear what they're saying first. If they're describing something super specific and detailed with no hesitation, that might lean toward truthful, but if it's vague or inconsistent, that'd be a red flag. Since I can't hear the words, I'm stuck with just the body language, and it's not giving me much to go on. So yeah, I'm leaning a little toward "maybe not lying," but I'd feel way more confident if I had more context. It's definitely one of those cases where it's easy to jump to conclusions, but I think I'd hesitate before calling it either way.

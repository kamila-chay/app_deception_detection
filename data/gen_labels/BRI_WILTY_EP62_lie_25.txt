Honestly, after watching the clip a few times, I have to admit that while there aren't any classic signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the overall calmness and neutral expression almost feel a bit too controlled. It's as if they're deliberately maintaining a steady demeanor, which makes me wonder if they're trying to hide something. Sometimes, people who lie frequently can become very skilled at managing their body language, so the absence of obvious tells might actually be a sign they're practiced at deception, rather than genuinely relaxed.

The fact that there are no micro-expressions or subtle emotional cues—no shifts or pauses—feels a little suspicious to me. It’s almost like the video is intentionally empty of those natural signs that usually accompany truthful responses. I know that lack of these signs doesn’t automatically mean someone’s lying, but it does make me lean in that direction, especially because the emotional flatness could indicate a conscious effort to control what they’re revealing.

Without hearing what they’re saying, it’s tough to be certain, but just based on the body language, I’d say there’s a decent chance they might not be completely honest. I’m not entirely convinced they’re lying, but I do lean toward thinking deception is a possibility here given the unusually steady and neutral presentation.

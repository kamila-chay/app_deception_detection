Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person is doing something that stands out—there's this really noticeable, almost forced wide-eyed look where their eyes open way more than normal, like they're trying to emphasize something or show they're being sincere. But here's the thing: they're not doing any of the other classic "nervous" stuff people usually associate with lying—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no avoiding eye contact, no raised eyebrows or lip biting. In fact, they seem pretty still otherwise, just holding that exaggerated eye opening for a bit.  

Now, I'd be cautious about jumping to conclusions because eye expressions can be tricky. Maybe they're just reacting to something surprising in the scene—like they genuinely got startled or are trying to convey strong emotion, not necessarily lying. Sometimes people naturally widen their eyes when they're telling the truth and want to seem earnest, especially if they're trying to be convincing. But then again, if they *were* lying, you'd expect more signs of stress—like fidgeting, looking away, or those little tells people often miss. The fact that they're not showing *any* of that makes me lean toward them being truthful, but honestly, it's not 100% clear.  

I guess the counterargument is: could that exaggerated eye opening actually be a *fake* sign of sincerity? Like, maybe they're overdoing it because they know people think wide eyes mean truth? But that feels like a stretch—it’s not the kind of thing you’d fake without other nervous habits popping up. And since they’re not doing anything else unusual, it kind of feels like that eye thing is just their natural reaction, not a deliberate lie tactic.  

So yeah, based on just this clip, I’d probably guess they’re telling the truth. But I’d still say it’s not a slam dunk—without hearing what they’re saying or seeing more context, it’s hard to be sure. Like, maybe they’re being honest about something they’re actually shocked by, which would explain the eyes. But I’d definitely want to check if the story they’re telling matches up with other facts before I’d feel totally confident. For now, though, the lack of other "lie" cues makes the truth feel more likely to me.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being honest or not. What stands out is how they're interacting—they're making direct eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels more genuine than avoiding it. They've got a natural-looking smile on their face, not forced or stiff, and their eyebrows are raised a bit like they're genuinely engaged or surprised by what they're saying. No fidgeting either—no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses where they seem stuck for words. That kind of calm, steady behavior often lines up with someone telling the truth, especially since there's no sign of nervous tells like excessive blinking or lip biting.

But I'm not totally sold on it, just because people can fake some of that stuff. Like, someone might practice a "relaxed" smile or force eye contact to seem credible, even if they're lying. And raised eyebrows could sometimes be a sign of uncertainty, not just openness—though here it seems more like they're reacting to something real. Honestly, though, the lack of other red flags (no scowling, no tense body language) makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they *were* lying, I'd expect more signs of stress, like shifting in their seat or avoiding eye contact, but they're just sitting there calm and focused. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—there are always exceptions. It just feels... consistent, you know? Like they're not trying to hide anything.

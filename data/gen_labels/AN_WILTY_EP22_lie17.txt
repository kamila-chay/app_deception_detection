While it’s difficult to be certain just from the video, there are some subtle signs that make me lean toward the possibility that the person might not be entirely truthful. They maintain consistent eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, but the repeated glances sideways combined with frequent eyebrow raises seem somewhat unusual. These behaviors could indicate hesitation or an attempt to appear calm while masking uncertainty. 

They don’t show more obvious signs of nervousness, like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which complicates things. It might be that they’re simply anxious about being recorded and trying to be cautious with their words, but the combination of maintaining connection through eye contact while simultaneously diverting their gaze sideways suggests a certain disconnect. This pattern could imply they’re rehearsing or carefully crafting their story, which aligns with deceptive behavior.

Though none of the cues definitively prove lying, and they might just be naturally expressive or uneasy on camera, the overall impression leans slightly toward deception. Without additional context about what’s being said or the situation, it’s hard to be sure, but I would cautiously suggest that there’s a reasonable chance they might not be fully truthful.

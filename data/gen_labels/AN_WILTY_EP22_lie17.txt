Honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure just from the video alone. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is true—so they're not avoiding looking at the person, which sometimes happens when someone's nervous about lying. But then they keep glancing sideways (gaze sideways true) and raising their eyebrows a lot (raising eyebrows true), which feels a bit off. I've noticed people do that when they're trying to seem calm or processing something, but it could also be a sign of hesitation.  

On the other hand, they don't seem to be fidgeting or avoiding eye contact entirely—no head shaking, no hands rubbing, no awkward pauses where the mouth stays closed. That makes me wonder if they're actually just nervous about being recorded, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're trying to be extra careful with their words because they know they're being watched, so the raised eyebrows might just be stress, not deception.  

But then again, the sideways glance and the eyebrow raises together... I've seen people do that when they're rehearsing a story or trying to sound convincing. It’s not a classic "lie" tell like lying with a smile, but it’s not completely innocent either. The fact that they’re looking at the person but then shifting their gaze sideways feels like a little disconnect—like they’re trying to maintain connection while secretly not fully engaging.  

I guess I’m leaning a bit toward it being deception, but I’m not 100% sure. It could easily be just someone who’s naturally expressive or anxious in front of a camera. Without more context—like what they’re actually saying or the situation—it’s hard to rule out either possibility. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s *plausible* they’re not being fully truthful, but it’s not obvious enough to call it a clear lie. It’s one of those cases where you’d probably want to hear the rest of the conversation to be sure.

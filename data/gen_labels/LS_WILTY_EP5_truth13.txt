Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's a bit tricky to say for sure if they're lying or not—I'm really trying to weigh the cues without jumping to conclusions. The person seems pretty calm overall, which is interesting because I'd expect more signs of stress if they were being deceptive. They're maintaining eye contact with whoever they're talking to (gaze towards interlocutor), which usually suggests honesty—people often avoid eye contact when lying, so that feels like a positive sign. There's also a subtle upturn at the corners of their lips, like a quiet, maybe even genuine smile, which doesn't feel forced. And they're not fidgeting at all—no hands rubbing, no scratching, no crossed arms—so their body language is pretty relaxed, which makes me lean toward truthfulness.  

But then there's the frequent blinking. That's the part that gives me pause. I've heard that people blink more when they're stressed or lying, so it's a red flag I can't ignore. Maybe they're just tired or the room's bright, but it's hard to rule out. I also notice they're looking down and sideways sometimes while talking—some might say that's a sign of deception, like they're trying to recall a lie, but it could just be them thinking or being thoughtful. Honestly, I've seen people look down while telling the truth all the time, especially if they're trying to remember details.  

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, you'd expect more obvious tells—like avoiding eye contact entirely, frowning, or nervous gestures. But here, they're not doing any of that. The lack of those classic "lie cues" is actually pretty convincing for truth. The lip corners up and steady gaze feel more like someone who's comfortable, not someone trying to cover something up. Still, I'm not 100% sure because blinking can be so ambiguous—it's not like a clear "yes" or "no" sign. Maybe they're just naturally a fast-blinker.  

All in all, I'd say the weight of the cues points more toward them telling the truth. The absence of stress signs and the calm engagement feels stronger to me than the blinking. But I'd be really hesitant to say "definitely" because it's not like they're giving a textbook honest performance—there's just enough uncertainty to keep me from being certain. If I had to guess, I'd lean truth, but I'd want to see more context to be sure.

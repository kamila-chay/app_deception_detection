Watching the clip, I'm trying to piece it together. The person seems pretty calm while talking—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or that nervous "I'm lying" energy you sometimes see. Their face is mostly neutral, no scowling or forced smiles, and they're not blinking a lot or touching their face. They keep a steady gaze on whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like someone being direct. Honestly, it *looks* like they're just being straightforward, not trying to hide anything.  

But here's where I hesitate: I've heard that some people don't show the classic "lying" tells at all, especially if they're practiced or just naturally cool under pressure. Maybe they're not nervous because they're telling the truth, but maybe they're just really good at hiding it. Like, I've seen people who lie smoothly without any of those little tells—no twitching, no awkward pauses. So it could be that they're lying, but they're just not the type to give themselves away physically.  

Also, the context matters a lot. If they're talking about something they've rehearsed or something they're super confident about, even a lie might feel natural to them. I'd want to know what they're actually saying before I'd feel sure. Without hearing the words, it's hard to tell if the *content* matches the calm delivery. Maybe they're being honest, but maybe they're just good at not sweating it.  

Honestly, I'd lean toward "truthful" just based on what I see—no red flags—but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's the kind of thing where if I saw it on a news clip, I'd think, "Hmm, seems legit," but I'd still wonder if there's more to it. Like, "Yeah, they seem relaxed, but could they be faking it?" It's tricky either way. I guess I'd say it *looks* truthful, but I'm not 100% sure.

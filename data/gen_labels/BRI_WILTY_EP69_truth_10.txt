Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth—though I'd be hesitant to say for certain. The person is nodding a couple of times while they're talking, which feels like a natural gesture of agreement or emphasis, not something that seems forced or rehearsed. And they're looking sideways, not down or away from the camera, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but sideways glances can just mean they're thinking or distracted, not necessarily hiding something. What stands out to me is how calm they seem—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses where their mouth's shut tight, no signs of the usual "tells" like frowning or excessive blinking. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more nervous energy, but they just seem... focused on whatever they're saying.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sideways gaze *could* be a way to avoid direct eye contact while lying, right? Like, they're trying to seem engaged but not actually meeting your eyes. And the nodding—maybe they're just being polite or trying to seem cooperative, not because they're being truthful. I've also read that some people lie really well without any physical signs, so the lack of "red flags" doesn't *prove* they're honest. It's tricky because lying and truthfulness can both look calm, especially if someone's practiced.  

But honestly, between the two, the absence of nervous behavior tips it for me. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a tiny bit of tension—like a quick frown or a hand movement. Here, it's just steady, calm, and the nod feels genuine. So yeah, I'd say truth, but I wouldn't bet my paycheck on it. It just feels... effortless, you know? Like they're not trying too hard to convince anyone.

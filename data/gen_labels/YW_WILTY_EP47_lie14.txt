Hmm, looking at this clip, it's somewhat difficult to be certain, but there are subtle signs that make me lean toward the person possibly not being entirely truthful. They seem calm and maintain direct eye contact, which often suggests honesty. They’re not avoiding gaze or fidgeting, behaviors commonly linked with deception. However, their eyebrows are raised consistently, almost as if surprised or skeptical, and raised eyebrows can sometimes indicate someone is trying to appear innocent while being evasive. While it's true that such expressions might just show confusion or surprise, the persistence of this gesture feels a bit off.

Additionally, the palms-up gesture usually signals openness and cooperation, which could argue against lying. Yet, the overall neutrality of their facial expressions—no smiles, laughs, or frowns—combined with that eyebrow raise suggests there might be some internal hesitation or disbelief about what they’re saying. Though classic tells like avoiding eye contact or nervous gestures aren’t present, it’s worth noting that some people who lie are skilled at maintaining calm and steady eye contact as a way to mask deceit.

Given the mix of signals here, I wouldn't say it definitively points to lying, but I do find myself leaning slightly toward the possibility that the person might be bending the truth. It doesn’t scream deception outright, but the eyebrow behavior and overall demeanor raise enough questions to make me somewhat skeptical.

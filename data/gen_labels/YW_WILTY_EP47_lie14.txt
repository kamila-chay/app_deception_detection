Hmm, looking at this clip, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. The person seems pretty calm overall—I notice they're making direct eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which usually feels more natural when someone's being straightforward. They're not avoiding gaze or fidgeting a lot, which sometimes happens when people are stressed about lying. But there's this one thing that stands out: their eyebrows are raised pretty consistently, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying. I've heard that raised eyebrows can sometimes be a sign of deception, like when someone's trying to seem innocent while actually being evasive. But honestly, people raise their eyebrows all the time when they're genuinely confused or reacting to something unexpected—it doesn't always mean they're lying.  

Then there's the palms-up gesture, which feels like a strong counterpoint. That open-hand thing usually comes off as honest or trying to seem cooperative, not deceptive. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or maybe a forced smile—but none of that's here. They're not smiling, not laughing, not even frowning, which is actually pretty neutral. It's like they're just calmly stating something, which could go either way.  

On the flip side, maybe the raised eyebrows are just a reaction to the question being asked—like, "Wait, are you serious about this?"—and not related to lying at all. And since they're not showing any of the classic "tells" (like excessive blinking or nervous gestures), it feels more like they're just being a bit thoughtful than hiding something. But I can't rule out deception entirely, because sometimes liars are really good at staying calm and keeping eye contact. It's just that the behavior here doesn't scream "lying" to me. I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure—these things are so context-dependent. If I had to guess without knowing the label, I'd say probably not lying, but it's definitely not a slam dunk.

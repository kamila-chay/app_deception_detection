Looking at the clip, I'm really trying to piece this together. The person seems pretty still overall—arms crossed the whole time, which often signals defensiveness or being closed off, but I've seen people do that when they're just comfortable or thoughtful. They're definitely looking at the person they're talking to, which usually leans toward honesty, but they're also glancing down a lot, which can sometimes mean they're avoiding eye contact or thinking hard. 

What stands out to me is how they're moving their lips—protruding and retracting them like they're chewing something or just nervous. And those raised eyebrows? That's a classic sign of surprise or skepticism, but it could also just be them reacting to the question. The awkward pauses with their mouth closed feel a bit off too—when people lie, they often fumble with words or pause more, but it's also possible they're just gathering their thoughts carefully. 

On the flip side, they don't have any obvious "lie signs" like frowning, laughing, or over-the-top gestures. No frequent blinking or avoiding eye contact entirely, which usually makes me lean toward truth. The head tilting and side-turning feels more like they're processing what's being said rather than hiding something. 

Honestly, it's a tough call. The crossed arms and lip movements make me wonder if they're stressed or uncomfortable about the topic, which *could* hint at dishonesty, but it's just as likely they're just a naturally expressive person or the situation is tense for a different reason. I don't see anything screaming "liar," but I also don't feel 100% convinced it's all straightforward truth. Without knowing what they're being asked about, it's hard to say if those pauses and lip quirks are nervousness or just how they talk. I'd probably say it's *more likely* truthful than not, but I'd want to see more context before I'd feel confident. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the actual conversation to be sure.

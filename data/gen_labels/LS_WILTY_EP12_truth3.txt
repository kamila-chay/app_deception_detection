Looking at the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—it's really hard to tell just from body language alone. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to and nodding along, which usually feels like someone being engaged and truthful. They're also looking up occasionally, which people often do when recalling something, and that can happen both when lying and when being honest. The head moving backward a bit seems a little odd—like maybe they're slightly pulling away, which sometimes happens when someone's uncomfortable—but it could just be a natural head movement while thinking.  

But then there's the frequent blinking. That's the part that sticks out to me because it's pretty noticeable. People often blink more when they're stressed or trying to remember something, which could lean toward deception. However, I've seen people blink a lot for totally harmless reasons—like if the room is bright or their eyes are dry—so it might not mean anything. The chin moving down a tiny bit also feels a little off, like they're tensing up, but again, it could just be a nervous habit or even a reflex.  

What makes me lean toward "truth" a bit more is that they don't have any of the classic "lie signs" like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting with their hands, or looking away a lot. They're actually pretty still otherwise—no crossed arms, no lip biting, no obvious signs of anxiety. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those tells, especially since the video seems to be a straightforward conversation. But honestly, I'm not confident either way. People are all different—some get really flustered when they're telling the truth, and some stay calm when they're lying. Without knowing the context or what they're talking about, it's just a guess. I'd say it's probably truthful, but I wouldn't bet on it. It’s the kind of thing where you’d want more info to be sure.

Watching this clip, I'd have to say I'm leaning toward them possibly not being fully truthful, but honestly, it's really hard to be sure. The first thing that stands out is how they keep raising their eyebrows—like, they're not just casually doing it, but it's a noticeable, almost repeated lift. That feels off, especially when paired with them looking down a lot instead of making direct eye contact, even though they're facing the person they're talking to. I've heard that people often look down when they're trying to fabricate something or avoid scrutiny, so that's a red flag for me. 

Then there's the hand stuff—scratching their head and touching their face or neck a couple of times. That's classic nervous energy, right? Like, when people are stressed or lying, they tend to fidget more. I've seen that in a lot of "truth or lie" videos before, so it adds to the suspicion. But here's where I start doubting myself: maybe they're just tired or anxious about the whole situation, not necessarily lying. I mean, if I were in an interview or something high-pressure, I'd probably be scratching my head too, even if I was being honest. And that raised eyebrow thing—sometimes people do that when they're genuinely surprised or skeptical, not when they're hiding something. Like, if the other person said something unexpected, it might just be a reaction, not deception. 

Also, they're actually looking at the person they're talking to most of the time, which feels a bit contradictory. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance of eye contact, but they're not completely avoiding it—they're just glancing down. Maybe they're trying to seem sincere while still being uncomfortable. The thing is, humans are messy. Nervousness doesn't always mean lying, and lying doesn't always look the same. I've seen people who lie with zero fidgeting, and others who fidget like crazy but are totally honest. 

So yeah, I'd say the signs point a bit toward deception—the raised brows, the downward gaze, the hand movements—but it's not a slam dunk. It could easily be just someone who's naturally anxious or in a weird headspace. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but if I had to guess? I'd lean toward "not telling the whole truth," but with a lot of hesitation. Like, I'd say "maybe" more than "yes."

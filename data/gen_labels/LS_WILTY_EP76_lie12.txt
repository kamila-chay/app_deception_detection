Hmm, that's a bit of a head-scratcher. So I'm watching this person talk, and honestly, it's not super clear-cut. At first glance, they're looking right at the person they're talking to—that usually makes me think they're being honest, like they're trying to be open. But then there's this weird sideways glance they keep doing while still kind of facing the camera. I've heard that when people are lying, they sometimes look away or shift their gaze like that, like they're avoiding direct contact. But it could also just be them being nervous or just naturally glancing around while thinking. 

Then there's that slight upturn at the corners of their mouth—like they're trying to smile, but it's not a full smile, just the edges of their lips lifting. The description says "smile" is false, so it's not a real smile, but it feels a bit forced. Sometimes people fake a smile when they're uncomfortable, which could be a sign of lying, but it could also just be them trying to seem friendly or polite. I mean, not everyone smiles when they're telling the truth, right? And they don't have any other classic "lie" tells—no fidgeting, no raised eyebrows in a surprised way, no avoiding eye contact completely. The raised eyebrows are just there, but not like a "wait, what?" reaction. 

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth, why the sideways look? Maybe they're just not used to being on camera and are a bit distracted. Or maybe they're genuinely thinking about the question, which would make the sideways glance natural. I keep going back and forth: the direct gaze feels like truth, but the sideways one feels like maybe they're hiding something. But honestly, it's so subtle—like, is that glance a sign of deception, or just someone who's not great at staring straight ahead? I'm not sure. I'd lean toward it being a lie because of that sideways thing, but I wouldn't bet money on it. There's just too much room for it to be something else. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably not a lie, but I can see why someone might think it is. It's one of those things where you just can't tell for sure from the video alone.

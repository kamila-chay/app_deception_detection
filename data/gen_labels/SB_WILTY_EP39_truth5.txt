Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not 100% sure, but the behavior here doesn't strike me as typical of someone lying. The person is consistently looking at the person they're talking to—like, they're not avoiding eye contact at all, which is interesting because I've heard people say liars often look away. Instead, they're actually glancing down a bit while speaking, which I think can sometimes mean they're being thoughtful or honest, not hiding. Their head movements seem natural too—tilting it, turning it side to side, even moving it forward and back like they're really engaged in the conversation. It doesn't feel forced or nervous. 

I also don't see any of those classic "lie signs" people point to: no fidgeting with their hands, no weird lip movements, no excessive blinking, nothing like that. If they were lying, I'd expect maybe more of that restless energy, but here they just seem calm and present. The chin moving up a little feels like a natural gesture when someone's speaking earnestly, not like they're trying to cover something up. 

But I guess I should consider the other side too. Maybe they're just really good at hiding it—some people don't show obvious signs when they lie, especially if they're practiced. Or maybe the down gaze is a tactic to seem humble while lying. And honestly, without knowing what they're saying, it's hard to be sure. Like, maybe they're lying about something small, but the behavior itself doesn't scream deception. 

All in all, I'd lean toward them telling the truth just because the cues seem so... ordinary. Like, if I were watching this in real life, I'd probably think, "Yeah, they seem genuine," but I'd still say "I'm not sure" because you can't really prove it from body language alone. It just doesn't feel like the kind of behavior that makes me doubt them.

Honestly, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure it out. The person seems really calm while speaking—no fidgeting, no looking away, no obvious signs of stress like frowning or darting eyes. They're just... steady. Holding eye contact (well, not *too* intense, but consistently looking at the camera), no weird mouth movements or nervous hand stuff. It’s almost like they’re just telling a straightforward story without any extra energy. That makes me lean toward them being truthful, because if they were lying, I’d expect *some* sign of tension—like maybe a pause, or a slight shift in posture. But here, it’s just smooth, even-toned delivery.  

But then I think, "Wait, what if they’re a really good liar?" I’ve heard some people can stay completely calm when lying, especially if they’re practiced or not super worried about getting caught. Maybe they’re just naturally low-key, not the type to show nervous habits. The fact that they don’t smile or nod much could just mean they’re not expressive, not that they’re hiding something. Like, maybe they’re just a quiet person, not a liar.  

I guess the thing that sticks with me is how *consistent* their calmness is—no sudden shifts, no micro-expressions flickering. If they were lying, I’d expect a tiny crack somewhere, even if it’s subtle. But here, it’s just… quiet. So yeah, it feels like truth to me, but I’m not 100% sure. It’s tricky because absence of "lying" signs doesn’t *prove* truth—just makes it seem more likely. Like, if someone’s lying but also really good at hiding it, they’d look exactly like this. But honestly? The more I watch, the more I think they’re probably telling the truth. It just doesn’t feel *off*.

Watching the clip, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. They were frowning quite a bit, with their eyebrows pulled down tightly, which can suggest stress—a common sign associated with deception. While it’s true that some people frown simply when concentrating hard, this expression combined with other behaviors makes me suspicious. 

They also kept tilting their head to the side and holding it up high, which struck me as potentially an attempt to appear confident or in control—a classic nervous posture that might hint at dishonesty. The upward gaze, which often suggests someone is trying to recall a genuine memory, initially made me doubt deception. But it’s also possible they were using that gaze deliberately, as a way to appear thoughtful or truthful while actually fabricating their story. Moreover, the slight upward chin movement seemed defensive, a type of gesture people sometimes use when they feel the need to protect themselves, which fits with the idea of hiding something.

Though the upward gaze is often linked to truth-telling, I’m cautious not to take it as definitive proof the person is being honest. In fact, the combination of a persistent frown and subtle defensive gestures leans me toward suspecting some level of deceit. Without more context, I can’t say for sure, but all things considered, I lean slightly toward the idea that the person might be lying.

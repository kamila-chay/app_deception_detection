Hmm, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're lying or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because I'm not seeing the clear red flags I've heard about for deception. They were frowning a lot—like, their eyebrows were pulled down tight while they spoke. That makes me pause because frowning can signal stress, and lying often causes stress. But I've also seen people frown when they're just concentrating really hard on a question, so it's not definitive.  

Then there's the head thing—they kept tilting it to the side and holding their head up high, like they were trying to seem confident or in control. That could be a sign they're nervous about lying, but it might also just be their natural way of speaking. And the way they kept looking up while talking? That's the part that really throws me off. I remember reading that when people look up during answers, it's often because they're trying to recall a real memory, which is usually associated with truth-telling. Like, if someone's making something up, they might avoid eye contact or look down, but here they're literally staring at the ceiling while they talk. That feels more like someone trying to remember something, not fabricate it.  

But wait—I should consider the other side. Maybe they're lying and the gaze up is a tactic to seem thoughtful, like they're "thinking" when they're actually lying. And the chin moving upward? It looked like a slight lift, almost like they were bracing themselves. That could be defensive, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. I mean, I've seen people do that when they're not being honest.  

Still, the gaze up keeps nagging at me. It's such a specific cue for truth-telling in studies I've read about, where people unconsciously look up when accessing real memories. If they were lying, I'd expect them to glance away more or fidget with their hands, but they weren't—no blinking, no hand movements, just that steady gaze up and the frown. It feels like the frown might just be them being serious, not stressed about lying.  

So, I'm really torn. On one hand, the frown and chin movement lean toward deception. On the other, the gaze up feels like a strong counter. I'd probably lean toward them telling the truth because of that gaze, but I'm not confident at all. It could easily be a coincidence, or maybe they're just a very intense person who frowns when they concentrate. I'd need more context—like what they're even talking about—to feel sure. For now, I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd hesitate to bet on it.

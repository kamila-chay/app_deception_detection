Hmm, I'm trying to figure this out myself after watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. On one hand, the person seems to be making eye contact with the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—like they're engaged and not hiding anything. But then I noticed they kept glancing sideways a few times, almost like they were avoiding direct focus, and they raised their eyebrows a couple of times too. I've heard that when people are lying, they sometimes do things like look away or raise their eyebrows to seem casual, so that makes me lean toward deception. 

But wait—there are other reasons they might do those things. Maybe they're just thinking about what to say next, or they're distracted by something in the room, like a noise or a light. I've seen people look sideways when they're just processing thoughts, not necessarily lying. And the eyebrow thing? Could be a natural reaction to something they're hearing, not a sign of guilt. Plus, they didn't smile or frown at all, which is a bit odd for a natural conversation—sometimes truth-tellers show subtle emotions, but maybe they're just serious or nervous for another reason. 

I guess the sideways glances are the biggest red flag for me, but I'm not ruling out that they're just distracted. It's really hard to say without more context—like, what's the conversation about? If it's a casual chat, the sideways looks might mean nothing, but if it's a high-stakes question, it could point to lying. I'd probably say "maybe" they're lying, but I wouldn't bet money on it. There's enough ambiguity that I'd want to see more of the video or hear the actual dialogue before I'm confident.

After watching the clip, I'm starting to think the person might be lying, though I'm not completely certain. They do make eye contact most of the time, which often suggests honesty, but the repeated sideways glances strike me as somewhat suspicious. These glances could indicate avoidance or discomfort, behaviors sometimes linked to deception. Their raised eyebrows might also be an attempt to appear casual or truthful, which can be a subtle red flag. While it’s possible they’re just distracted or thinking through their words, the combination of these cues leans me toward suspecting they could be withholding the truth. Without more context or additional evidence, I can’t be definitive, but overall, I’m inclined to believe there’s a chance they’re not being fully honest.

Watching the clip, I'm trying to gauge if they're being truthful based on what I see. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because body language isn't always a perfect tell. What stands out to me is that they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time—gaze toward interlocutor is true—and they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact, which often gets flagged when people lie. They also don't have that classic "deer in headlights" look: no frowning, no forced smiles, no nervous hand movements like rubbing or scratching. Instead, I notice they raise their eyebrows a couple of times—like when they're processing something or maybe surprised by a question—but that's not inherently deceptive. It could just be genuine surprise or emphasis. And they do glance down a few times, which some might interpret as avoiding truth, but I've seen people look down when they're just thinking carefully, not necessarily lying. 

On the flip side, I can see why someone might doubt it. If they were lying, you'd expect more signs of tension—like fidgeting, a forced smile, or avoiding eye contact completely. But they don't show any of that. The lack of those typical "lie cues" makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the raised eyebrows are nervousness masked as surprise, or the downward glances are subtle avoidance. Still, the fact that they maintain consistent eye contact with the other person feels more like engagement than deception. I guess I'd say it seems like they're telling the truth based on what I'm seeing—no red flags jumping out at me—but it's hard to be certain without knowing the context. People can be nervous without lying, and the cues here don't scream deception. So, I'm probably going to go with truth, but I'd want to hear the full conversation to be sure.

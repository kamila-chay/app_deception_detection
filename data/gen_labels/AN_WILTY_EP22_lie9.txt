Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not—I'm just watching the clip and trying to make sense of it. What stands out to me is that they're keeping direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to the whole time, which usually makes me lean toward them being truthful. Like, most people who are being deceptive tend to avoid eye contact or glance away, so that feels a bit counterintuitive for a lie. Plus, they don't seem nervous at all—they're not fidgeting, blinking a lot, or making any weird facial expressions. The head shaking is the only thing that catches my eye, but that's such a common gesture for "no" or "I disagree" in normal conversation. It doesn't seem exaggerated or forced, just like how someone might shake their head while politely disagreeing with a friend.

But then again, I know some people are really good at lying without showing obvious signs—maybe they've practiced or they're not stressed about it. The head shaking could actually be part of the lie, like they're trying to emphasize their denial with a physical gesture to seem more convincing. And since there's no other tension in their body language, it might just be a calm, rehearsed lie. I mean, I've seen people who lie about small things without breaking a sweat, especially if they're used to it. So on the flip side, the lack of nervous cues could also mean they're confident in their story, which might actually point to deception. 

It's really hard to say for sure, though. Without knowing the context—like what they're being asked about or how they usually act—I'm just going by the video. If they were lying about something big, I'd expect more signs, but maybe this is a minor thing they're not worried about. Either way, I'd hesitate to call it a lie based on this alone. It feels like they could be telling the truth, but I can't rule out deception either. Honestly, I'd want to hear the actual question they're answering before I'd feel confident either way.

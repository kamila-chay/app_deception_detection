I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward the person possibly being deceptive, though it's really tricky to say for sure. The main thing that stands out to me is they're crossing their fingers—like, both hands with the index and middle fingers crossed behind their back or something. I've seen that a lot in videos where people are trying to hide something, like they're hoping for luck or trying to "cancel out" a lie. It feels like a nervous habit that might be trying to mask something, especially since they don't seem to be showing other obvious signs of lying, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting a lot.  

But here's where I hesitate: crossing fingers could totally be a harmless habit for them. Maybe they do it all the time when they're thinking, or it's just a nervous tic they've had for years, not related to lying at all. I've known people who cross their fingers when they're just concentrating on a problem, not when they're being deceptive. And honestly, they don't seem super anxious—no rapid blinking, no fidgeting with their face, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tell" signs, but they're actually pretty calm in the rest of their body language. That makes me wonder if the finger-crossing is just coincidence, or maybe they're doing it for a different reason entirely, like hoping for a good outcome in the conversation.  

It's also possible they're not lying at all—maybe they're just super comfortable in the moment, and the finger thing is just a random gesture. I mean, we all have little habits we don't even notice. Without more context—like what they're saying or the situation—it's really hard to pin down. I'd say the finger-crossing is the strongest clue here, but it's not enough to call it deception for sure. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're hiding something, but I wouldn't bet on it without seeing more of the video or hearing their words. It's one of those things where the absence of other tells makes it confusing—usually, liars show more stress, so the lack of that makes me question if the finger thing even matters. Honestly, I'd want to watch it again to see if there's anything else I missed.

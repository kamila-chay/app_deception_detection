Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not—truth be told, it's kind of a toss-up. They're smiling pretty consistently, which feels genuine at first glance, not forced or fake. Like, their lip corners are up, and it doesn't seem to disappear when they pause. But the way they're looking... they keep glancing down and sideways instead of meeting the other person's eyes directly. I've heard that avoiding eye contact can be a sign of lying, but I also know that's not always true—some people just naturally look away when they're thinking or being sincere, especially if they're not used to being on camera. 

The chin moving upward a few times also stands out. It's subtle, like they're nodding to themselves or affirming something internally, which could fit with someone telling the truth and just being thoughtful. But then again, if they were lying, they might do that to seem more convincing. The thing that makes me lean slightly toward truth, though, is how calm they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no hands rubbing, no weird blinking or mouth movements—just a steady, quiet presence. If they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy, like shifting in their seat or touching their face. Here, it feels... contained. Like they're just sharing something personal without trying too hard. 

But I can see the other side too: maybe the down gaze is because they're constructing a story, and the smile is just a way to soften it. People lie all the time without obvious signs, so absence of "red flags" doesn't prove truth. Honestly, without knowing the context—like what they're even talking about—it's really hard to say. I'd probably need more to go on, like the tone of their voice or the actual words they're saying. Right now, I'm just guessing based on what I see, and I wouldn't bet money on it either way. It feels like they're being honest, but I'm not gonna claim I *know* for sure.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's a bit tricky to say for sure, but here's how it's landing for me. The person is making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to the whole time, which feels significant—most people who are lying tend to look away or seem distracted, so that makes me lean toward them being truthful. They're also raising their eyebrows a few times, which honestly looks more like genuine surprise or emphasis, like "Wait, really?" rather than that nervous, over-the-top eyebrow thing some people do when they're trying to seem convincing while lying. And there's nothing else going on—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no lip biting or anything that usually pops up when someone's hiding something. 

But I should say, I'm not 100% sure. Some really practiced liars can keep eye contact and avoid other tells, so maybe they're just good at it. And that eyebrow raise could be a bit exaggerated, though it doesn't feel forced like it would if they were trying to fake sincerity. Honestly, the absence of all those classic "lie cues" (like frequent blinking or avoiding gaze) makes me think they're probably being honest, but I can see how someone else might think, "Well, they're *too* calm—maybe that's suspicious?" Like, if they were lying, wouldn't they at least seem a little more tense? But I don't see that tension here. It just feels... natural. Like they're answering a question they're comfortable with, not rehearsing a story. So yeah, based on how I'd read this as a normal person watching, I'd probably guess truth, but I'd still say it's not a slam dunk—just the most likely option given what's happening on screen.

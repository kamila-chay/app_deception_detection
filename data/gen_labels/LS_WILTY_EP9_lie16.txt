Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. The person seems pretty engaged with the other person—they're looking right at them the whole time, which actually feels like a sign of being truthful to me, not deceptive. Like, when people lie, they often avoid eye contact or look away, so that gaze toward the speaker stands out as unusual for deception. They're also nodding along while talking, which feels natural, like they're agreeing or emphasizing points, not like they're faking it. 

But then there's that head shaking—like a slow "no" motion at one point. That *could* be a red flag, right? Sometimes people do that when they're denying something or trying to seem firm. And the raised eyebrows... that's a bit odd. It's not a full smile or a scowl, just a little lift—maybe they're surprised by the question, or maybe they're trying to seem innocent? But I'm not sure. Raised eyebrows alone don't scream "lying" to me; they could just be reacting to what's being said. 

On the flip side, I don't see any classic deception signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or forced smiles. No awkward pauses either—just steady speech with those nods and the gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous energy, like touching their face or blinking a lot. But they're not doing that. The head shake feels like the only thing that might point to deception, but it's so subtle and could easily be part of their normal speaking rhythm. 

Honestly, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The eye contact and natural nodding feel stronger than that one head shake. But I can see why someone might think it's deception—maybe the head shake was misinterpreted as denial, or they're just a very expressive person. It's hard to say for sure without knowing the context of what they're saying. Like, if they're denying something specific, the head shake *could* fit, but if it's just a general response, it probably doesn't mean much. I'd need to hear the actual words to feel confident. So... yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but it doesn't *feel* like lying to me based on what I'm seeing.

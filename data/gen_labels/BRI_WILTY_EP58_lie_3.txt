Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it's honestly a bit hard to pin down whether they're lying or not. They're maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is solid—and that usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? But then they're also looking sideways a lot, and their head's constantly tilting and turning side-to-side. Normally, when people are being deceptive, they might avoid eye contact or seem fidgety, but here it's the opposite—they're engaged visually but with these odd head movements. It almost feels like they're *trying* to seem attentive, but the head tilting and side-turning... I've seen people do that when they're genuinely thinking or processing something, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're recalling a detail and their head just naturally moves as they're sorting through it.

But then I wonder—could those head movements actually be nervous habits? Sometimes people who are lying might unconsciously shift their head to avoid direct gaze, even if they're still looking at the person. The sideways glance could be a way to "steer" their attention away from something they're uncomfortable with, even if they're trying to keep eye contact. And head tilting... I've heard some people say it's a "truth-telling" gesture, but I also know it can be a sign of uncertainty, which might happen when someone's fabricating a story. 

The thing is, there's no obvious "lie signs" here—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no micro-expressions like frowning or lip biting. They're pretty still otherwise, which makes it confusing. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic cues, but they're not showing any. Still, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, right? Maybe they're just a very calm liar, or maybe they're just naturally expressive. I'd lean toward truthfulness because of the steady eye contact, but that sideways glance and head movement keep nagging at me. Honestly, without more context—like the conversation topic or their baseline behavior—it's really a toss-up. I'd say it's probably not deception, but I can't rule it out entirely. It just doesn't scream "lying" to me, but it also doesn't feel completely relaxed either. Hard to say for sure.

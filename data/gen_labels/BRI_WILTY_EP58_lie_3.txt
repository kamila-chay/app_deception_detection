Based on what I'm observing in the video, there are some mixed signals that make me lean slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive. While they are maintaining eye contact—which often suggests honesty—they are also frequently looking sideways and constantly tilting and turning their head. These movements could be attempts to appear engaged and attentive, but at the same time, they might point to nervousness or discomfort. From what I know, when people lie, they sometimes use subtle avoidance tactics like shifting their gaze slightly or moving their head in ways that distract from full direct eye contact. 

Although they don’t exhibit the classic signs of deception such as fidgeting, awkward pauses, or micro-expressions, those subtle head movements and sideways glances could indicate uncertainty or an effort to mask the truth. The lack of obvious deception cues makes it difficult to be confident either way, yet these nuanced behaviors raise a suspicion that they might not be entirely forthcoming. Without additional context or knowledge of their normal behavior, I wouldn’t say it’s definitive, but I do find myself leaning more toward the possibility that they could be lying.

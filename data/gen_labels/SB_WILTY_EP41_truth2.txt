Watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky to say for sure. On one hand, a lot of what they're doing seems like it *could* point to them being honest. They're looking directly at whoever they're talking to the whole time—no avoiding eye contact, which is often a sign liars try to hide. Their arms are open too, which usually feels like someone is being receptive and not hiding anything. And the way they tilt their head and turn it slightly side-to-side? That just looks like normal, engaged listening, not the kind of fidgety or defensive stuff you see when people are nervous about lying. Even the chin moving up and down feels natural, like they're just emphasizing points while they talk, not like they're trying to cover up something.

But then there's that exaggerated eye closing they do a couple times—kind of like they're shutting their eyes tight for a second. I've heard some people say that's a sign of lying, like they're trying to "remember" a story, but honestly, I've seen people do that when they're just thinking hard or trying to recall something real. It could be innocent. And yeah, the head moving side-to-side and the gaze shifting up and down might seem a little odd, but it doesn't scream "deception" to me—it just feels like they're processing what they're saying. The thing that really sticks with me is how calm they seem otherwise: no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed like they're stalling, no scowling or raised eyebrows. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little stress signals.

Still, I can't rule out the possibility that they're just really good at hiding it. Maybe the eye closing is a habit, or maybe they're trying to seem sincere by overdoing the eye thing. But the more I watch, the less it feels like deception. The openness of their body language and the direct eye contact just seem too consistent for someone who's making things up. It’s not like I’m 100% certain, but based on what I’m seeing, I’d lean toward them telling the truth—though I’d definitely want to hear more context before I’d be totally sure. It’s weird how sometimes the absence of "lie signs" can be as telling as the presence of them.

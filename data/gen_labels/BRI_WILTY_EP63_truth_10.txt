Honestly, I'm a bit torn here because the video just shows this person sitting there, and they're not doing anything super obvious. Like, they're not fidgeting, not blinking a lot, not avoiding eye contact in a way that jumps out at me—wait, actually, they're not looking at the person they're talking to, which is a little odd, but not super suspicious on its own. I mean, some people just don't like making eye contact, even when they're being honest. And they're not smiling or scowling either, which feels… neutral? Like they're just calmly answering without any big emotional reactions.  

But here's where I get confused: if they were lying, I'd expect them to maybe look away more, or fidget, or seem tense—like, you know, the classic "nervous liar" stuff. But they're just… still. Not even shifting in their seat. That makes me think, maybe they're actually telling the truth and they're just a calm person? Like, not everyone gets flustered when they're being honest. But then again, what if they're *too* calm? Like, maybe they're rehearsing or trying to seem unbothered, which could be a sign of lying. I've heard that really practiced liars can control their body language super well, so the lack of tells might actually be a red flag.  

The thing that leans me toward truth, though, is how smoothly they're speaking. The description says no awkward pauses, and from what I can see, they're not stumbling over words or hesitating. Truth-tellers often have that natural flow, even if they're nervous, but here there's no sign of nervousness at all—just steady, normal speech. If they were lying, I'd expect at least a little stumble or a forced pause, but they're not doing that.  

Still, I can't rule out the possibility that they're just really good at hiding it. Like, maybe they've done this before and know how to stay still. But honestly, the more I think about it, the more the "no signs of stress" thing feels more consistent with truth than lies. Most people don't pull off that level of calm when they're lying—it's harder than people think. So yeah, I'm leaning toward truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It's one of those cases where the absence of "liar signs" might actually be the clue, not the lack of them. It's weird, though—like, why would someone who's lying not show *any* of the usual stuff? Maybe they're just not a nervous liar. I'd say truth is more likely, but I'd want to see more context to be sure.

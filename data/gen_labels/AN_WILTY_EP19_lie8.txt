Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm honestly a bit torn on this one. The person seems to be holding steady eye contact with the person they're talking to the whole time—like they're really trying to make that connection—so that feels like it could be a sign they're being open. And their hands are just sitting there, palms up and open, which usually makes me think someone's being genuine, like they're not hiding anything physically. I've heard that palms up can signal honesty, so that's a point in favor of them telling the truth.  

But then again, I know some people who are really good at faking it, right? Like, maybe they're just used to being on camera or they've practiced how to look calm and direct. I've seen people who lie smoothly while keeping eye contact and not fidgeting at all—sometimes that's even a red flag because it's *too* controlled. And honestly, the fact that they're not showing *any* of the usual nervous tells—like fidgeting, avoiding eyes, or even blinking a lot—makes me wonder if they're just really practiced. It's not that they *look* deceptive, but it's also not the messy, "I'm not sure" energy I'd expect from someone who's being truthful.  

I guess I'm leaning a little toward deception just because the lack of any visible stress signs feels a bit... off? Like, if they were really just answering a straightforward question, I'd expect maybe a tiny hesitation or a small gesture, but here it's all very smooth. But I'm not sure—I could totally be wrong. Maybe they're just naturally calm, or maybe they're just really good at this. It's hard to say without knowing the context of what they're being asked. Honestly, after watching it a few times, I'm still not 100% sure, but I'd say deception is possible just because the "too perfect" calm makes me question it. But I'd need more to go on to feel confident either way.

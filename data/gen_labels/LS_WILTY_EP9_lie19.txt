It's tricky to say for sure just from watching, but here's how I'm leaning after looking at the clip. The person seems pretty engaged—they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, nodding along like they're actively listening, and even tilting their head a bit like they're processing what's being said. They're smiling too, which honestly feels natural in the moment, not like a forced "I'm lying" smile. I've seen a lot of videos where people who are being deceptive *avoid* eye contact or seem stiff, but here they're actually leaning in with their head and keeping their gaze steady. The chin moving up a little could be a sign of confidence or just how they naturally speak, not necessarily nervousness. 

But then again, I know deception is weird—sometimes people smile *more* when lying to seem friendly or to cover up. And that head tilt/sideways turn might just mean they're thinking hard about their answer, which could go either way. Like, if they're making up a story, they might do that to buy time. I also wonder if the context matters—like, if they're denying something serious, even a calm smile might feel off. But without knowing what they're being asked about, it's hard to say. 

Honestly, the absence of classic "lying" signs (no fidgeting, no avoiding eyes, no weird blinking) makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. People are all different, and some liars are really good at not showing tells. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% sure—deception is so hard to spot just from video alone. If I had to guess, I'd say they're telling the truth, but I'd want to see more of the conversation first.

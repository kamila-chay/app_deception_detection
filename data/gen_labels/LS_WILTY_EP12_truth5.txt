Honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up when I watch it, but I'll try to break it down like I'm just watching the clip. The person keeps making direct eye contact with whoever's talking to them, which feels like a good sign—liars often avoid that, right? And they're nodding along consistently, which seems like they're genuinely engaged or agreeing. That makes me lean toward truth, especially since they're not doing those classic "nervous liar" things like fidgeting with their hands, avoiding eye contact, or looking away a lot.  

But then there's the frequent blinking—like, they're blinking way more than normal, which I've heard people associate with lying. And they're raising their eyebrows a few times, which can sometimes feel like they're trying to seem surprised or skeptical, like they're covering something up. I mean, I've seen people do that when they're stressed about answering something, even if they're telling the truth. Maybe they're just really focused or a bit anxious about the question, not necessarily lying.  

The thing that makes me hesitate is that they're not showing *any* of the obvious "lie" cues—no frowning, no awkward pauses, no lip biting or hands covering their face. If they were making it up, I'd expect at least one of those. The blinking might just be a habit or them being extra careful with their words, not deception. Like, maybe they're trying hard to stay calm and that's why they're blinking so much.  

So yeah, I'm kinda stuck between "this feels truthful" because of the eye contact and nodding, and "wait, why are they blinking so much?" But overall, the absence of the other red flags tips it for me. I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—sometimes people get nervous and blink a lot even when they're being honest. It's not 100% clear, but it feels more like a stressed-but-truthful moment than a lie.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call without more context, but based on what I'm seeing in the video... I'm leaning toward them possibly not being entirely truthful, but I'm not 100% sure. The main thing that stands out is how they keep looking sideways—like, not at the person they're talking to, but off to the side, almost like they're avoiding direct eye contact. I've heard people say avoiding eye contact is a common sign of lying, so that makes me pause. But honestly, it could just be their natural way of looking when they're thinking or maybe they're just shy, especially if they're not used to being filmed.  

Then there's the palms-up thing—they've got their hands open like that the whole time, which usually feels like a "I'm being honest" gesture, right? Like when someone says "I swear" and holds their palms up. That kind of contradicts the sideways gaze. If they were nervous or lying, I'd expect them to fidget or cover their mouth or something, but they're not doing any of that. No frowning, no awkward pauses, no weird blinking. So on the flip side, all those *absence* of nervous signs might actually point to them being calm and truthful.  

But here's where I'm confused: if they were genuinely telling the truth, why would they look sideways so consistently? Maybe they're just distracted or thinking about what to say next, which can happen even when you're honest. Or maybe the sideways glance is just a habit—some people do that naturally. I don't want to overinterpret it.  

Honestly, I'd say the sideways gaze is the strongest clue, but it's not definitive. Without knowing what they're talking about or how they normally act, it's hard to say. If I had to guess, I'd say deception is possible, but it's not a slam dunk. Like, it's the kind of thing where you'd need more context—like, are they answering a hard question? Is this a high-stakes situation?—to feel more confident. Right now, I'm just leaning toward "maybe" because of the gaze, but I'd definitely want to see more of the clip or hear the conversation first.

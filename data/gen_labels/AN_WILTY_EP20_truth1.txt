Looking at the video, I'd say the person seems pretty composed overall. They're not doing any of the obvious "nervous liar" stuff—no frantic blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no fake smiles or awkward pauses where they'd be trying to cover up. Their eyes stay mostly fixed on the person they're talking to, which usually leans toward honesty, and they're not avoiding eye contact like some people do when they're lying. The way their head is tilted slightly down and they're looking downward a bit while speaking... that actually feels more like someone thinking carefully about what they're saying, not trying to fabricate something. I've seen a lot of people who are being truthful actually look down when recalling details, so that doesn't jump out at me as a red flag.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. The chin moving downward a bit could be interpreted as hesitation—maybe they're searching for the right words, which could go either way. And sometimes people who are lying *do* keep their gaze steady to seem convincing, so the direct eye contact might not mean much on its own. I've also heard that downward gaze can sometimes signal deception in certain contexts, like if they're avoiding accountability. But honestly, the absence of all those other classic stress cues (like lip biting, hand rubbing, or that stiff "awkward pause" mouth thing) makes it feel more like they're just a calm, thoughtful person.  

If I had to guess based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them telling the truth. It doesn't feel like they're putting on a performance or hiding something—they seem genuinely engaged, and the behavior just doesn't match the usual patterns I've noticed in deceptive people. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it either; it's not a slam dunk. There's always room for misinterpretation, and maybe they're just really good at hiding it. But yeah, right now, the video feels more like truth than lies.

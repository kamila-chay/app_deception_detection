Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. What stands out to me is how they're moving their face—like their eyebrows are raised pretty high, almost like they're surprised or skeptical, and their mouth opens a bit too wide when they speak, which feels a little forced. Then there's this thing where their lips pull back tight, almost like they're holding their mouth closed in a way that doesn't look natural, and they keep pausing with their mouth shut, like they're searching for words. Their eyes are mostly down, and they keep turning their head sideways instead of looking straight at whoever's talking to them. They nod a few times, but it seems a bit stiff, not like a natural agreement.

At first glance, these cues do make me wonder if they're being deceptive—raised eyebrows can signal tension, the exaggerated mouth and lip retraction often come up in nervousness, and avoiding eye contact or looking down is something people sometimes do when they're not being honest. The awkward pauses while their mouth's closed also feel like they're struggling to keep up a story. But then I start second-guessing myself because some of this could just be them being shy or uncomfortable in the moment. Like, maybe they're not used to being on camera, or the question they're answering is genuinely hard for them to process. I've seen people with natural habits like raised eyebrows or a slight lip pull without it meaning anything shady—they might just have a way of expressing themselves. And the head turning sideways? That's something a lot of people do when they're thinking, not necessarily lying. Also, they didn't do any of the classic "lie signs" like fidgeting, blinking a lot, or covering their mouth, which makes me think it might not be as clear-cut as it seems.

Honestly, I'm leaning a little toward deception because of the combination—especially the mouth stuff and the gaze avoidance—but I'm not at all sure. It's easy to misread these things because people's baseline behavior varies so much. If they're usually expressive and this feels off, it might be a red flag, but if they're usually quiet and reserved, it could just be them being themselves. I'd need more context—like what they're being asked about or how they act in other situations—to feel confident. Right now, it's just a gut feeling based on what I'm seeing, but I'd hesitate to call it a solid "they're lying" without more to go on. It feels like they're trying a bit too hard to seem calm, but I could easily be wrong.

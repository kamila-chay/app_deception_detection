Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching. I see the person is speaking to someone, and they're actually making eye contact with the interlocutor most of the time, which feels a little odd if they were lying—most people avoid eye contact more when they're being deceptive, right? But then they keep glancing down occasionally, which I've heard is sometimes linked to lying, though I've also read that people look down when they're just thinking or feeling uncomfortable, not necessarily lying. 

Their lips seem kind of pulled back, like they're clenching them a bit, which could be nervousness. But honestly, I've seen people do that naturally when they're concentrating or just being serious—it doesn't always mean they're hiding something. And they're not smiling, laughing, or doing those quick, nervous gestures like blinking a lot or touching their face, which are the signs I usually associate with deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little fidgets or micro-expressions. 

On the other hand, the fact that they're maintaining eye contact *while* occasionally looking down makes me wonder if they're just really focused on what they're saying, maybe trying to recall something. Like, if someone's trying to remember a detail, they might look down while thinking, not because they're lying. And the lip thing... maybe it's just their normal way of talking, or they're holding back an expression. 

I'm not totally sure. It's easy to jump to conclusions about "lying" based on one or two cues, but the absence of other classic signs (like fidgeting or avoiding eyes) makes me think it might just be them being thoughtful or a bit stressed about the conversation. But I could be wrong—maybe the lip retraction and downward glances are subtle tells I'm not picking up on. Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without more context. I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It just doesn't *feel* like the classic "I'm lying" behavior I've seen before.

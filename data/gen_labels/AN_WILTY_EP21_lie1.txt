This is a bit challenging to judge simply by watching, but there are some subtle cues that make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. They maintain eye contact most of the time, which is somewhat unusual for someone lying since many people tend to avoid eye contact when being untruthful. However, the occasional glances downward catch my attention—while this can be a sign of thinking or discomfort, it is also sometimes linked to deception. The lips being pulled back in a slightly clenched way could suggest nervousness, though it could also be concentration or seriousness.

Interestingly, the absence of more obvious signs like nervous gestures, fidgeting, or micro-expressions that typically accompany lying makes it less clear. The person’s behavior seems controlled, but the combination of consistent eye contact with those brief downward looks and subtle lip tension makes me suspect there might be some underlying unease or concealment. It’s possible they are just focused or stressed, but taking all cues together, I tend to think there’s a chance they might not be fully truthful. I wouldn’t say it’s definitive, but overall, I lean toward the idea that they could be lying.

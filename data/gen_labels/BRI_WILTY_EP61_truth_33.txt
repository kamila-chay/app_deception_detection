Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though I can't say for certain. The person seems really calm and composed the whole time. They're not fidgeting, not avoiding eye contact, not doing any of those little nervous tells you often see when someone's hiding something—like biting their lip, scratching their head, or looking away too much. Their face is pretty neutral too; no sudden frowns or forced smiles that might hint at discomfort. They're just sitting there, talking normally, with their head steady and hands still. That feels like someone who's not stressed about what they're saying.

But here's where I hesitate: sometimes really good liars don't show any of those classic signs. Like, if they've practiced a lot or are just naturally chill, they might stay completely calm even when lying. I mean, I've seen people who seem totally relaxed while lying about something huge—like if they're used to it or just don't care. So the lack of nervous behavior doesn't *prove* they're truthful; it just doesn't scream "liar" to me. It could also be that whatever they're saying isn't actually that big a deal to them—like they're just describing a boring Tuesday, not hiding a secret. 

On the flip side, if they *were* lying about something serious, you'd expect *some* tension, right? Like a slight shift in posture or a tiny hesitation. But here, everything feels... smooth. No awkward pauses, no raised eyebrows, no anything. It's almost too steady. That makes me think maybe they're not hiding anything, but I can't rule out that they're just really good at hiding it. Honestly, without knowing the context of what they're saying, it's hard to be sure. But based on the body language alone, it feels more like truth than deception—just not 100% guaranteed. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to hear the actual words before I'd feel completely confident.

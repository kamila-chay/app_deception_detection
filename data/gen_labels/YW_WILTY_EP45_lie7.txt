Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from watching, but I'd lean toward them not being completely comfortable with what they're saying—maybe even a bit deceptive, though I'm not 100% certain. What stood out to me was how they kept their arms crossed the whole time, like a wall between them and whoever they're talking to. That's something I've noticed people do when they're nervous or trying to hold themselves back, especially if they're not fully on board with what they're saying. Then there were those eyebrows—both raised and furrowed at the same time, like they were caught between being surprised and stressed. It felt a little off, like they were trying to project a certain emotion but it wasn't quite matching. And they kept nodding along, but it felt a bit stiff, like they were forcing agreement instead of genuinely engaging.

But I can see why someone might think they're being honest too. They were looking right at the person they were talking to the whole time, which usually feels like a sign of sincerity to me. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away more, not lock eyes like that. And their posture wasn't all over the place—no fidgeting or covering their face, which are bigger red flags I've seen in other videos. Maybe the crossed arms just mean they're cold or just like sitting that way, and the eyebrows were just them reacting to something in the conversation, not necessarily lying. Sometimes people get stressed about things that aren't even about lying—like if they're just worried about how they're being perceived.

Honestly, it's a toss-up. The crossed arms and the weird eyebrow thing make me think there's something off, but the steady eye contact and lack of other classic "telling" signs (like avoiding gaze or fidgeting) make me hesitate. If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably deception, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It just feels like they're holding something back, even if it's not a full lie. Maybe they're just uncomfortable, but the way it all fits together—arms crossed, tense brows, forced nodding—makes me lean that way. Still, I'd want to see more context to be sure.

It's difficult to be completely certain just from watching, but I tend to think they might not be entirely truthful. The fact that they kept their arms crossed throughout the conversation struck me as a potential sign of defensiveness or discomfort, which often occurs when someone is hesitant or possibly hiding something. Their eyebrows were raised and furrowed simultaneously, an expression that seemed inconsistentâ€”almost as if they were attempting to convey an emotion that didn't quite fit, which can be a subtle cue of unease or deception. Additionally, their nodding appeared somewhat forced, lacking the natural fluidity of genuine agreement.

On the other hand, they maintained steady eye contact, which generally suggests sincerity, and there were no obvious signs of nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding gaze that often accompany dishonesty. It could be that the crossed arms were simply a habitual posture or a reaction to the environment, and the eyebrow movements might have been genuine responses to the conversation rather than indicators of lying. Stress or discomfort can come from many sources not related to deception.

Taking all of this into account, while I can't say for certain, my impression leans toward the possibility that they are being deceptive. They seem to be holding something back or not fully comfortable with their words. That said, more context would be needed to be confident, so I remain cautious but inclined to suspect some level of dishonesty.

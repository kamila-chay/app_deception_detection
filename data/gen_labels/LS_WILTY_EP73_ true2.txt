Honestly, watching this clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not. What stands out to me is how steady their gaze is—they're looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, and their head's up, not darting around. That feels like it could be a sign of honesty, since people who lie often look away or seem distracted. Plus, they're raising their eyebrows a bit, which seems natural—like they're genuinely surprised or processing something, not acting. I've seen that happen when people are telling a real story and react to their own memories.  

But I can't be totally sure, right? Because some people are really good at faking it. Maybe they've rehearsed this so much that they're calm on the surface, and the eyebrow raise is just part of their "performance" to seem believable. I've heard that skilled liars can even maintain eye contact and avoid nervous ticks like fidgeting, so the lack of those signs doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth. It could also be that they're just naturally expressive—some people raise their eyebrows a lot even when they're being honest, and it's not tied to the content at all.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure without more context, but based on what I'm seeing, the absence of typical stress cues (like avoiding eye contact or nervous movements) makes me lean toward them being truthful. But I'd still be cautious—people lie in all sorts of ways, and this could just be someone who's very composed under pressure. I guess I'd say it feels more like truth than lie, but I'm not 100% certain. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the full conversation to be sure.

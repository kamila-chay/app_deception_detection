Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'll walk through what I'm seeing as I watch. The person seems to be looking directly at whoever's talking to them the whole time—like they're really trying to keep eye contact. That's interesting because I've heard some people say liars avoid eye contact, but I also know that's not always true. Sometimes people who are lying *overcompensate* and stare too much to seem honest. So that gaze could go either way.  

Then there's the eyebrows—those kept going up a couple times, like they were surprised or confused by the question. I wonder if that's just them reacting genuinely, though. Like, maybe they *are* surprised the question was asked that way, not necessarily lying. It's hard to tell if that's a nervous tic or just a natural reaction.  

What throws me off is how calm they seem otherwise. No fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles or frowns—just steady, neutral expressions. If they were making something up, I'd expect more of those little tells, like touching their face or looking away. But here, they're just sitting there, eyes locked on the other person, eyebrows flicking up once in a while. It feels... almost too calm for someone who's lying. Like they're not stressed about it.  

But then again, I've heard that really practiced liars don't show the obvious signs. Maybe they've done this before and know how to keep it smooth. Or maybe the eyebrows are a sign they're thinking hard about what to say, not that they're lying. Like, they're trying to recall something accurately, which can look like surprise.  

Honestly, the more I watch, the more I lean toward them telling the truth. The consistent eye contact feels more like someone who's comfortable with what they're saying, even if it's a bit unusual. But I'm not ruling out deception either—maybe it's just a really good liar, or maybe I'm missing something subtle. I’d need to see the context of the conversation to be sure, but based on what I'm seeing here, I’m not convinced they’re lying. It just doesn’t *feel* like the classic "lie" behavior I’d expect. Still, I could be wrong—I’ve been fooled before by people who seemed totally genuine.

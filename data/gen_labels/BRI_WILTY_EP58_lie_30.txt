Hmm, looking at the clip, I'm really not sure. The person seems to have this slight, almost hesitant smile—lip corners up a bit—and their eyebrows are raised, like they're surprised or maybe a little skeptical about what they're saying. But they're not looking at the person they're talking to; their eyes are kind of down, glancing away. That downward gaze makes me pause because I've heard people say that avoiding eye contact can be a sign of lying, but I also know it's super common for people to look down when they're just thinking or feeling shy, especially if they're not used to being on camera. 

On the other hand, the raised eyebrows and that tiny smile don't scream "deception" to me. If they were really trying to cover up something, I'd expect more nervous stuff—like fidgeting, frowning, or even forced laughter, but none of that's happening here. They're actually pretty still otherwise. Maybe they're just being polite or trying to seem calm, which could happen whether they're lying or not. Like, if they're telling the truth but feel awkward about the question, they might smile a bit and look down to avoid seeming confrontational. 

I guess the thing that nags at me is the combination: the raised brows (which can mean "I'm processing this") plus the downcast eyes (which sometimes means "I'm hiding something"). But honestly, I've seen so many people look down while answering honestly during interviews or casual chats—it's not a dead giveaway. Without knowing the context of what they're saying or how they usually act, it's really hard to tell. Maybe they're just a quiet person. I'd lean a little toward them being truthful, but I'm not at all confident about it. It feels like one of those moments where the behavior alone doesn't tell the whole story.

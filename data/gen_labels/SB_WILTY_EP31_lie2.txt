Watching the clip, I'm a bit torn because it's tricky to tell just from body language alone. On one hand, the person is smiling and raising their eyebrows a lot—those can sometimes feel like "tells" for someone trying too hard to seem friendly or casual, especially when paired with a downward gaze and a head tilt. I've seen people do that when they're nervous or rehearsing an answer, so it made me wonder if they were hiding something. The chin moving upward too—like they're trying to appear confident—added to that suspicion. But then there's the open arms, which is such a strong sign of openness and honesty. If they were lying, I'd expect them to have their arms crossed or be fidgeting, not like they're genuinely inviting conversation. The fact that they're still looking toward the person they're talking to (even if their eyes are down) also feels more like shyness or thoughtfulness than deception. Honestly, it could easily be them being naturally expressive or just a bit anxious about the topic, not necessarily lying. I mean, people smile and tilt their heads all the time when they're being genuine—like when they're trying to be extra careful with their words. So while the raised eyebrows made me pause, the overall vibe leans more toward truth than deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It's just hard to say for sure without knowing the context.

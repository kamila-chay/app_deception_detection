This situation is a bit ambiguous, but when I look closely, there are some subtle signs that make me lean toward thinking the person might be deceptive. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which on the surface suggests honesty, since liars often avoid looking directly at someone. However, the eye contact seems almost too deliberate, as if they're forcing it to appear truthful, which can be a red flag in itself.

At the same time, they frequently raise their eyebrows—more than usual and quite consistently. While eyebrow raising can sometimes indicate genuine surprise or confusion, it can also be a nervous tic or a way to mask discomfort and conceal the truth. The constant eyebrow movement feels a bit unnatural and doesn't fully align with someone who is entirely at ease.

Additionally, there are no obvious signs of tension like frowning, pauses, or lip biting, which might suggest nervousness typical of lying. But the calm demeanor combined with the exaggerated eyebrow raising and intense eye contact could mean the person is trying hard to convince, rather than just naturally responding.

Given these conflicting clues—the forced eye contact and unusual eyebrow behavior—I can’t say for certain they’re lying, but I do lean toward suspecting some level of deception. It’s not definitive, but the indicators make me question the sincerity a bit more than I would otherwise. More context or the content of the conversation would definitely help clarify things, but based on what’s observable, I’m inclined to think the person might not be entirely truthful.

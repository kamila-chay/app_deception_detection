Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from watching, but I'll try to break it down as I'm seeing it. So the person is talking to someone, and the main thing I notice is that they keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like, not just once, but pretty consistently throughout the interaction. And they're definitely looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time, no avoiding eye contact. 

Now, on the surface, that steady eye contact usually makes me think they're being honest, right? Like, people who lie sometimes look away or fidget, so holding gaze feels like a good sign. But then there's the eyebrow thing. I've heard that raising eyebrows can sometimes be a nervous tic or a way to seem "surprised" when you're actually hiding something. It's not a super clear sign on its own, though—people do it when they're genuinely confused or trying to emphasize something. 

I wonder if the eye contact is actually a bit *too* steady? Like, maybe they're forcing it to seem truthful, which could be a red flag. But then again, maybe they're just really engaged in the conversation and genuinely surprised by the question, hence the raised eyebrows. There's no frowning, no awkward pauses, no lip biting or anything else that screams "this person is lying." They seem pretty calm otherwise, which is weird because I'd expect someone lying to be a bit more tense. 

On the flip side, if they were telling the truth, why the constant eyebrow raises? It feels a little unnatural. But then, some people just have that as a habit—like, they raise their eyebrows when they're thinking hard or being polite. I can't rule out that it's just how they talk. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The eye contact leans toward truth, but the eyebrow thing leans toward deception. And since there's nothing else to go on—no signs of stress or obvious tells—it's probably just them being themselves. Maybe they're not lying, but I can't be 100% sure. I'd probably lean toward "not lying" because of the eye contact, but I'd still be a little doubtful because of those eyebrows. It’s one of those cases where you’d want to see more of the context or hear the actual conversation to be certain. I don't feel super confident either way, to be honest.

Hmm, looking at this clip... it's a bit tricky. The person seems to be talking while keeping their gaze mostly down, which makes me think they might be avoiding eye contact. That's one thing that often comes up when people are being careful with what they say. They also have this slight chin lift—like they're pushing their chin up a bit—and their lips are turned up at the corners, but not really smiling, just... there. Kinda stiff? And they're nodding along while they talk, which feels a bit odd because people usually nod when they're agreeing or processing, but here it's happening while they're speaking, like they're trying to seem engaged.

On the flip side, though, they're not doing the obvious "lie signs" everyone expects—no fidgeting, no obvious sweating, no rapid blinking or laughing nervously. In fact, they're pretty still otherwise, which sometimes happens when people are rehearsing or being very controlled. The raised eyebrows could just be surprise or curiosity, not deception. And the gaze down? Could mean they're thinking hard about what to say, not necessarily lying. Like, if I were trying to remember a detail, I'd probably look down too. The head tilting and side-turning also feel more like they're just naturally gesturing while talking, not like they're trying to hide something.

I guess the part that sticks out most is that lip corner up—almost like they're forcing a smile but it's not full. But I've seen people do that when they're just trying to be polite or calm, not when they're lying. And the chin movement... it's subtle, but maybe it's just how they talk normally? Honestly, without knowing what they're even saying or the context of the conversation, it's really hard to say. It *could* be deception, but it could also just be someone who's a bit awkward or thoughtful. I wouldn't bet on it being a lie based on this alone—I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying and see how they interact with the other person. It's not clear enough for me to call it a definite "lie," but it's not a clear "truth" either. Feels like a maybe, but I'd hesitate to say for sure.

This is a somewhat difficult call based solely on the video, but there are cues that make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. On one hand, they seem engaged, maintaining eye contact, nodding, and displaying open body language—palms up and arms spread out—which often suggest honesty. Their smile appears genuine at first, not forced or exaggerated. 

However, the frequent downward gaze raises some suspicion, as people sometimes look down when they're avoiding direct eye contact to conceal something. While this isn't definitive—some look down when thinking or feeling shy—the pattern here is notable. Additionally, the smile seems unusually steady, not shifting with the conversation, which can indicate an attempt to mask nervousness or discomfort. The conflicting description of their arms being both open and folded adds further uncertainty; folded arms could signal defensiveness, hinting at concealment, while the open palms suggest otherwise.

Taken together, these mixed signals make me incline toward the idea that the person might not be fully truthful, though it's far from certain. It's quite possible they're just nervous or reserved about the topic rather than outright lying. Without more context or information about the content of their speech and responses, it's hard to be sure, but the signs here slightly lean toward deception rather than honesty.

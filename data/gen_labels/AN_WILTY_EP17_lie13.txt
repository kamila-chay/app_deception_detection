Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not. The thing that stands out most is that they're constantly looking down—like, their gaze is directed downward the whole time, not at the person they're talking to or anywhere else. Now, I know a lot of people think liars avoid eye contact, so that *could* be a sign they're hiding something. But honestly, I've also heard that some people naturally look down when they're being truthful, especially if they're thinking hard about what to say or trying to be polite. It might just be their default way of interacting, not deception.

What really makes me hesitate is that there's *nothing else* going on that I'd usually associate with lying. No nervous blinking, no fidgeting with their hands, no awkward pauses where their mouth's just shut tight, no raised eyebrows like they're trying to seem surprised. They seem pretty calm and steady, actually. If they were lying, I'd expect to see *some* of those little tells—like people do in those "how to spot liars" videos—but here, it's just... quiet. Like they're just thinking or being reserved.

But then again, I guess the opposite could be true too. Maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show any of the obvious signs, and the downcast eyes are actually a calculated thing to seem sincere. Or maybe they're just uncomfortable in general, not because they're lying. Like, maybe they're shy or stressed about the whole situation, and that's why they're not looking up. Without knowing what they're saying or the context, it's super hard to tell. 

Honestly, the more I watch, the more I lean toward them being truthful just because there's no evidence of the usual nervous energy. But I'm not gonna say for sure—I mean, I've seen people who seem totally chill but are lying through their teeth. So yeah, I'd guess they're probably telling the truth, but I'd need more to be confident. The down gaze is the only thing I'd even question, and even that feels more like a personality thing than a lie. Still, I'd want to hear the actual conversation before I'd feel comfortable saying either way.

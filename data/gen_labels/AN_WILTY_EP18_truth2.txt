Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm watching, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, though it's a bit tricky. The way they're looking directly at the person they're talking to—no shifting eyes or avoiding contact—feels like they're being engaged and honest. Plus, their head keeps moving forward like they're really listening, which usually matches someone who's trying to connect, not hide something. And they're not fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact, which I'd expect if they were nervous about lying.  

But then there's the crossing fingers and the shrugs. I've seen people do that when they're trying to seem casual or maybe even a little defensive, which sometimes happens when someone's not being fully truthful. Like, crossing fingers can be a nervous tic, especially if they're trying to "make it true" in their head. And the shrugs—well, shrugs can mean "I don't know" or "it's not my fault," which might feel like they're deflecting a bit.  

On the flip side, though, their eyes are really exaggerated—opening and closing them wide—like they're trying to emphasize points. I know some people do that naturally when they're excited or just expressive, not because they're lying. And the fact that they're not pausing awkwardly or looking down (which I'd expect if they were scrambling for a story) makes me think they're just being animated.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The crossing fingers is the part that sticks out to me as a possible red flag, but it could just be a habit. Like, maybe they always do that when they're talking, and it's got nothing to do with lying. If I had to guess, I'd say truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels more like someone who's just a little nervous but being genuine, not someone actively trying to deceive.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing, I'd lean toward them not being fully truthful—though it's tricky. The way they're squinting their eyes shut really exaggeratedly when they say their part, like they're trying to shut out something, and their eyebrows are raised way higher than normal, almost like they're surprised *at themselves* for saying it. That feels off, like they're forcing a reaction. And the smile they give? It's there, but it doesn't reach their eyes—it's kind of stiff, like they're trying to seem friendly while they're actually nervous.  

But here's where I hesitate: they keep looking right at the person they're talking to the whole time. That usually makes me think someone's being honest, not lying, because liars often avoid eye contact. And their chin keeps dipping down like they're thinking hard or maybe just tired, not necessarily hiding something. I wonder if the exaggerated eye closing was just a reflex—like they blinked hard because of the light or something, not because they're lying. Or maybe the smile was genuine surprise at the question, and the rest was just them being a little awkward.  

It's really a toss-up. The eye stuff and the forced smile scream "something's off," but the steady eye contact and the chin movement make me second-guess. If I had to guess without more context, I'd say they're probably not telling the whole truth, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It feels like they're trying *too* hard to seem calm, which sometimes happens when people are lying, but it could just be them being overly polite or stressed. I'd want to see more of the conversation before I'd feel confident.

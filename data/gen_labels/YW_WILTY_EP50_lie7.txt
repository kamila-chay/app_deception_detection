Hmm, looking at this clip, I'm really not sure. The person seems pretty calm overall, which makes me lean slightly toward them being truthful, but I can't rule out lying entirely. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—gaze directly toward the interlocutor—and their arms are open, which usually signals openness or confidence. That feels like it's working against the idea of deception, since people often cross their arms or look away when they're not being honest. Plus, they're not doing any of the classic nervous tells like fidgeting, touching their face, or excessive blinking. 

But then there's the raised eyebrows—they do that a few times while speaking, almost like they're surprised or skeptical about what they're saying. Sometimes people raise their eyebrows when they're trying to seem innocent or when they're rehearsing a lie to sound convincing. It's a bit ambiguous though. I've seen people raise their eyebrows naturally when they're just emphasizing something, especially if they're speaking with energy. And the open arms might just be their normal way of gesturing, not necessarily a sign of truthfulness. 

On the flip side, if they were lying, they might be putting in extra effort to seem relaxed and engaged—like maintaining eye contact and keeping their arms open to appear trustworthy. I know that skilled liars can actually do that, so the absence of obvious nervousness doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth. It just means they're not showing the usual signs of stress. 

Honestly, it's really hard to say. The cues are mixed: the direct gaze and open posture feel honest, but the raised eyebrows give me pause. Without more context—like what they're actually saying or how they react to follow-up questions—I'd hesitate to call it a definite lie. I'd say it's a maybe, leaning toward truthfulness just because there's no clear "lie" behavior, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's the kind of thing where you'd want to hear the rest of the conversation to be sure.

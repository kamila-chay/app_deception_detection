After watching the clip, I'm really not 100% sure if they're lying or not—it's one of those situations where the body language feels a bit mixed. On one hand, they're making solid eye contact with the person they're talking to and nodding along, which usually makes me think they're being genuine. They also have their arms open the whole time, which feels like a sign of openness, like they're not hiding anything. That part makes me lean toward them telling the truth.  

But then there's the eyebrow thing—they're raising them a lot, almost like they're surprised or trying to seem extra innocent. I've heard from some psychology stuff that people sometimes do that when they're lying, like it's a nervous tic or an unconscious way to soften their expression. And they're shaking their head too, which in a conversation can feel off if it's not matching what they're saying—like if they're saying "yes" but shaking their head "no," that kind of conflict might hint at deception. But honestly, head shaking can also just be a habit or a way to emphasize a point, so I'm not sure if it's relevant here.  

The thing that's really throwing me off is that the open arms and eye contact feel so "truthful," while the eyebrows and head shake feel like potential red flags. I keep thinking, "Maybe they're just really expressive or nervous about the topic," but then I wonder if that nervousness is because they're lying. Without knowing exactly what they're being asked or what they're saying, it's hard to tell for sure. I'd say it's possible they're lying, but I'm not confident about it—these gestures can mean a lot of different things depending on the context. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward deception because of the eyebrow raising, but I'd want to see more of the conversation to be sure. It's one of those cases where you just can't tell from the video alone.

Hmm, this is tricky to call just based on what I'm seeing. The person's posture stands out first—arms are wide open, which usually feels like someone trying to seem approachable or honest, not hiding something. That makes me lean a little toward them being truthful, especially since there's no obvious nervousness like fidgeting or covering their face. But then there's that frown—eyebrows pulled down tight, not a smile or laugh anywhere—and they keep looking up, not at the person they're talking to. I've heard some people say looking up can be a sign of lying because they're "making it up," but honestly, I've also seen people do that when they're just trying to remember details, so I'm not sure if that's the case here. 

The open arms really throw me off though. If they were lying, I'd expect them to cross their arms or seem more closed off, like they're guarding themselves. But they're just standing there with arms out, which feels... relaxed? Maybe they're just naturally expressive. And no other red flags—no quick blinking, no awkward pauses where their mouth's closed, nothing like that. It's almost too calm for someone who's lying, which is confusing because I'd expect more tension. 

On the flip side, that persistent frown and avoiding eye contact (gazing up instead of at the person) could definitely be signs of discomfort or guilt. Maybe they're not lying about the facts but are uncomfortable with the question itself. Or maybe they're just a naturally serious person who frowns a lot, and the upward gaze is just how they think. I keep circling back to the arms—they feel like a strong counterpoint to deception. If I had to guess based on this alone, I'd say it's *possible* they're lying, but it's not clear-cut. It feels more like they're just... stressed about the conversation, not necessarily trying to hide something. I'd want to hear the actual words they're saying before I'd feel confident about it. Like, maybe they're just recalling something hard, and that's why they're frowning and looking up. Yeah, I'm leaning toward "not lying" but I'm not at all sure—body language alone is so hard to read.

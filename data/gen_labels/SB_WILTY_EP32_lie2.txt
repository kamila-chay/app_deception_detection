This is a tough one to judge, but overall, I find myself leaning slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive. Their wide-open arms typically suggest openness and honesty, which usually wouldn't align with lying. However, the persistent frown and the way they frequently look upward rather than making eye contact are noteworthy. While looking up can sometimes mean someone is trying to recall information, it’s also been associated with fabricating details. The lack of typical nervous signs like fidgeting or closed-off posture is unusual for someone who might be lying, but it could also be a deliberate attempt to appear calm and collected.

There’s a bit of a contradiction here: the open arms suggest relaxation and honesty, but the facial expression and gaze hint at discomfort or something to hide. Perhaps they are uneasy about the topic or the situation, which might make them prone to bending the truth without being fully forthcoming. The overall impression isn’t clear-cut, but given the subtle signs of discomfort combined with behaviors sometimes linked to deception, I’d cautiously say there’s a chance they’re not being completely truthful. Still, it’s far from certain, and I’d want to consider what they’re actually saying before drawing a firmer conclusion.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward them telling the truth—though it's really hard to say for certain. The person isn't doing any of those classic "lie signs" like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting a lot. In fact, they seem pretty calm: no frowning, no exaggerated expressions, and they're not avoiding looking at the person they're talking to (wait, actually, they *are* looking away a bit—gaze down or sideways, I think—but that's not super unusual. People often look down when they're thinking or being thoughtful, not just when lying). The main things that stand out are them tilting their head a bit and occasionally touching their head or neck with their hand. Head tilting can just mean they're listening carefully or processing something, and touching the head might be a natural habit—like when you're trying to remember something. 

But here's where I hesitate: some people *do* touch their face or head when they're nervous, so it could be a sign of lying. And the fact that they're not making much eye contact *might* raise a little red flag. But honestly, I've seen a lot of people who are just naturally a bit reserved or distracted in conversations, especially if they're explaining something. If they were lying, I'd expect more signs of stress—like faster blinking, fidgeting with their hands, or avoiding eye contact more intensely. Here, it's all pretty neutral. The absence of those "strong" deception cues makes me think it's more likely they're just being calm and thoughtful, not deceptive. Still, I wouldn't bet the farm on it—body language is super context-dependent. Maybe they're just tired, or the situation is just... quiet. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'm not 100% sure. It just doesn't *feel* like a lie to me.

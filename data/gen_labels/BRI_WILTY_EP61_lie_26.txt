Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems really calm and composed while speaking—no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or excessive blinking. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, their posture is relaxed, and they don't seem to be hiding anything with their hands or facial expressions. Honestly, it’s almost *too* still. Most people who are lying—especially if they're not practiced—tend to show *some* tension, like fidgeting or a forced smile, but here they’re just... normal. It makes me lean toward them being truthful because if they were lying, I’d expect at least a hint of discomfort, even if subtle.  

But then I think about it again: maybe they’re a really good liar who’s practiced this. I’ve read that some people can suppress all the classic tells, especially if they’re rehearsed or not stressed about getting caught. In that case, the lack of cues might just mean they’re skilled, not that they’re honest. Also, the video doesn’t show their actual words—maybe they’re saying something that contradicts known facts, but the behavior itself isn’t giving me red flags. It’s hard to say for sure because deception is so context-dependent.  

Honestly, I’m not 100% certain. If I had to guess based *only* on what I see, I’d probably say they’re telling the truth because the behavior aligns with how most people act when they’re being honest—no tension, no overcompensating. But I’d also be wary because I’ve seen cases where people who lie well look exactly like this. It’s not like the video’s screaming "liar" or "truth-teller," just… neutral. So yeah, I’m leaning toward truth, but I’d want to hear what they’re actually saying before I’d feel confident about it.

I'm not 100% sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth, though it's a bit tricky. They're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like they're engaged and trying to be honest. They're nodding along and even leaning their head forward slightly while tilting it—those are really good signs of active listening, not someone who's trying to cover something up. 

That said, there are some things that make me pause for a second. They're raising their eyebrows a lot, which sometimes happens when people are processing something or feeling skeptical, but it could also just be them reacting to what they're saying. And their lips are pulled down at the corners with their lips slightly pushed out—that *can* look like tension or frustration, which sometimes happens when people are nervous, even if they're being truthful. They're also blinking a lot, which I know people often associate with lying, but I've heard that frequent blinking can just mean someone's tired, stressed, or really concentrating, not necessarily lying. 

The thing that makes me more confident they're being truthful is how they're not avoiding eye contact at all—they're looking right at the person talking to them the whole time, and they're nodding like they're genuinely following along. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting or shifting their gaze away, but they're not doing that. The head tilting and leaning in also feels like they're trying to connect, not hide. 

On the flip side, I could see someone thinking the raised eyebrows and lip position *do* look suspicious, especially if they're used to seeing those cues in lies. But honestly, I think those might just be them being a little tense about the topic—not necessarily deceptive. Like, maybe they're explaining something they're not proud of, so they look a bit strained, but still telling the truth. 

So yeah, I'm probably going to say they're being truthful, but I wouldn't bet money on it. It's one of those cases where the "truth" cues (eye contact, nodding, engagement) seem stronger to me than the "lying" cues (which could just be nerves). But it's definitely not a slam dunk—there's enough ambiguity that if I saw this in real life, I'd probably ask follow-up questions to be sure.

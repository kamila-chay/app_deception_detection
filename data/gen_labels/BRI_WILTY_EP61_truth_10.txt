Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but after watching the clip a couple of times, I'd lean toward them telling the truth, though I can see why someone might second-guess it. The thing that stood out most was how they kept their eyebrows furrowed the whole time—like they were really concentrating or maybe a bit frustrated with the question. At first glance, that *could* seem like someone trying to think of a lie, but I've noticed in other videos that people often frown when they're just trying to recall details accurately, especially if they're nervous about getting it right. It didn't feel like a "fake" frown, more like genuine focus.  

Then there were the open palms and the shrugs—they kept doing that, like "I don't know, but I'm being honest about it." Those gestures usually signal openness or uncertainty, not deception. If they were lying, I'd expect more fidgeting, like touching their face or avoiding eye contact, but their gaze was mostly down or sideways, which could just mean they're not used to being filmed or are thinking carefully. They didn't smile or laugh, which sometimes happens when people are uncomfortable lying, but it also happens when people are serious or tired—like maybe they're just not in a cheerful mood that day.  

That said, I can see why someone might think they're lying. The furrowed brows *do* look tense, and if you only saw that without the other cues, it might raise a red flag. But the palms up and shrugs feel more like "I'm not hiding anything" than "I'm lying." Plus, no awkward pauses or lip movements—like they weren't stalling or trying to cover up. Honestly, it’s really close either way, but the overall vibe felt more like someone being earnest than deceptive. I’d guess truth, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it—depends a lot on what they were even talking about.

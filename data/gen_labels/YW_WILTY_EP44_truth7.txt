Hmm, this is tricky to call just from the video alone. On one hand, they're looking directly at the person they're talking to most of the time, which usually feels like a sign of honesty—people often avoid eye contact when they're not being truthful. But then there's that mix of frowning eyebrows *and* raised eyebrows at the same time, which is a bit odd. It doesn't look like a natural expression; it feels like they're trying to hold a serious look but also reacting to something unexpected. And the sideways glance, even if brief, makes me wonder if they're avoiding direct focus, which some people do when they're recalling something or feeling uneasy. 

But here's where I'm not sure: the rest of their behavior seems really calm. No fidgeting, no lip biting, no nervous blinking—just steady, if a little tense, posture. If they were lying, I'd expect more physical signs of stress, like touching their face or shifting around. The frowning might just be them concentrating hard on remembering something, not necessarily deception. I've seen people look like that when they're trying to be careful with their words, not when they're hiding something. Plus, the fact they're maintaining eye contact while doing it feels more like someone being earnest than someone trying to cover up a lie. 

Honestly, it's hard to say for sure. The eyebrows and sideways glance could be red flags, but the lack of other nervous tells makes me lean toward them being truthful. Maybe they're just naturally expressive or genuinely troubled by the question, not lying. I'd need more context—like what they're talking about—to feel confident. Right now, it just feels like they're being careful, not necessarily dishonest.

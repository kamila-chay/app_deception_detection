Honestly, I'm a bit torn on this one because the cues seem a bit mixed. On one hand, they're smiling (lip corners up) and maintaining steady eye contact with the person they're talking to, which usually feels like a good sign for truthfulness—like they're engaged and not avoiding the interaction. The shrug at the end also feels neutral, like they're just emphasizing "I don't know" or "it's not my fault," which often happens when people are being straightforward. And the frowning eyebrows? That’s confusing at first glance—like they might be stressed or skeptical, but it could just be them genuinely thinking hard about what they're saying, not necessarily lying.  

But then there's that frowning while smiling... that feels a little off. If they were lying, some people might force a smile to seem calm while their brows pull down in tension, like they're trying too hard to appear friendly. And the steady gaze? I know some liars do that too to seem convincing, so it’s not foolproof. Maybe they’re just nervous about the topic, which could make them frown while smiling.  

I guess what keeps me leaning toward truth is the *lack* of other classic "lie" signs—no awkward pauses, no blinking a lot, no looking away, no hands covering their mouth. The shrug especially feels like it’s more "I’m being honest about this" than "I’m making it up." But I’m not 100% sure because people can be nervous and still tell the truth, or they can be calm and lie. Honestly, if I had to guess without knowing the context, I’d say they’re probably being truthful, but I’d want to hear the actual conversation to be certain. It’s one of those cases where the behavior is *close* to what truth-tellers do, but the frown makes me hesitate a little.

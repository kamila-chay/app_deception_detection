Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t be entirely certain. Their frequent looking away—glancing down and to the side while still trying to engage—feels somewhat off. Typically, people who are honest maintain steadier eye contact, so this behavior raises some questions. The way their head moves backward and turns sideways repeatedly gives the impression that they might be trying to distance themselves from the conversation, which could be a subtle sign of discomfort or avoidance. Additionally, the repeated covering of their mouth and face with their hands stands out as a notable stress indicator, often linked to holding back the truth. These factors collectively nudge me toward suspecting deception.

That said, their open arm posture tends to suggest openness, which doesn’t fit neatly with lying. They’re still somewhat engaged and not completely avoiding eye contact, so it’s possible they’re simply anxious or uneasy about the situation rather than being untruthful. Some of the gestures, like hand-to-face contact, could also be explained by general nervousness rather than deceit. The absence of other common lying behaviors, such as forced smiles or excessive blinking, makes me hesitate to be too sure.

Overall, while I’m not convinced beyond doubt, the combination of the mouth-covering, head movement, and gaze patterns makes me lean more toward the idea that they may be lying, even if the signals aren’t definitive. Without more context or the conversation itself, it’s hard to be sure, but the clues point slightly in that direction.

Honestly, watching this clip, I'm not totally sure if they're lying or not—it’s really tricky. On one hand, the way they’re looking away a lot stands out to me. They’re glancing down and sideways while still trying to look at the person they’re talking to, which feels a bit off. Like, when people are being honest, they usually hold eye contact more consistently, right? And their head’s kind of moving backward and turning sideways a lot—almost like they’re trying to physically distance themselves from the conversation. Plus, they keep covering their mouth and face with their hands, which I’ve heard is a common stress signal when someone’s trying not to say something. That part makes me lean toward deception.  

But then there’s the arms being open, which usually signals openness or honesty, not lying. And they’re not fidgeting with their hands or avoiding eye contact completely—they’re still engaging with the person, just in a distracted way. Maybe they’re just nervous or uncomfortable about the topic, not necessarily lying. I’ve seen people do all those things (looking down, covering their mouth) when they’re just shy or stressed about something unrelated to lying. Like, maybe they’re anxious about the interview itself, not the content.  

The hands touching their head or face is the strongest signal I’m noticing, but I can’t rule out that it’s just general anxiety. If they were lying, I’d expect more of those classic cues like forced smiles or excessive blinking, but they’re not doing any of that. So it’s a toss-up. Honestly, I’d say the evidence leans slightly toward deception because of the mouth-covering and head movements, but I’m not confident at all. It could easily be just someone who’s really nervous, and I’d want to hear the actual conversation to be sure. Hard to say for sure without more context.

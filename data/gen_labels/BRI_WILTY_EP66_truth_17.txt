Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or telling the truth, but I can share what stands out to me. The person seems to be making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to—like they're really engaged in the conversation—though sometimes their gaze shifts sideways a bit, which I've noticed people do when they're thinking or recalling something. They also have their eyebrows raised quite a bit, which feels like it might be a natural reaction to what they're saying, maybe surprise or emphasis, but I'm not sure if that's a sign of lying or just how they speak. Importantly, they don't seem to be avoiding eye contact entirely, and there's no fidgeting, no obvious signs of nervousness like rapid blinking or covering their mouth—things I've heard people associate with lying. 

That said, I'm hesitant to say they're definitely telling the truth because raised eyebrows can sometimes be a way someone tries to seem more sincere when they're actually being deceptive, and the sideways glances might just mean they're not used to being recorded or are just thinking. Also, the absence of "lying" cues doesn't automatically mean they're honest—some people are really good at staying calm under pressure. Honestly, the way they're speaking and the lack of nervous habits makes me lean toward them being truthful, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. It's hard to say for sure just from this clip alone; it feels like it could go either way depending on the context they're in. I'd need more to go on to feel confident, but based on what I see, I'm not spotting anything that screams "lying" to me.

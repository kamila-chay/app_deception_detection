Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not entirely sure if they're lying or not—there are some mixed signals here. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me, and they're nodding along like they're engaged, which also leans toward being truthful. Their palms are up, open and relaxed, which often reads as genuine or non-defensive in my experience. But then there's that frequent blinking happening—almost like they're trying to avoid looking at something directly, or maybe they're just really nervous about the topic. I've seen people blink a lot when they're stressed, even when they're telling the truth, like if they're in a high-pressure situation or just generally anxious.  

That said, the lack of other classic "lie cues" stands out to me. No frowning, no awkward pauses where their mouth stays closed, no shifting gaze or fidgeting with their hands. If they were trying to hide something, I'd expect more of those little tells—like avoiding eye contact or tensing up. But they seem pretty calm otherwise, just a bit... twitchy with the blinking. Honestly, it could be that they're genuinely nervous about the subject they're discussing, not necessarily lying. Like, maybe they're telling the truth but feel uncomfortable about it, which would explain the blinking without needing deception.  

I guess the counterargument is that frequent blinking *can* sometimes correlate with deception in high-stakes moments, especially if it's sudden or out of character. But without knowing the context—what they're talking about, how they usually act—I can't be sure. If I had to guess, I'd lean toward them being truthful, but I'd be really hesitant to say for certain. The blinking is throwing me off, but the rest of their body language feels too consistent for someone who's trying to cover up something. It’s one of those cases where it’s hard to tell if it’s just nerves or something else.

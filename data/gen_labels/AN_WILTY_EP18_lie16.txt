Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—it's tricky. They're smiling a lot, which usually feels like a natural reaction, but it seems a bit... stretched? Like they're forcing it a little, especially when they're talking about something that might be sensitive. I also notice they're raising their eyebrows a lot, which often happens when someone's trying to seem surprised or innocent, but it could just be them being expressive. The part that stands out most is how they're closing their eyes really exaggeratedly, like they're squeezing them shut for a second—almost like they're avoiding looking at the camera or trying to "think" of something. That feels off, but I've seen people do that when they're just being dramatic, not necessarily lying.

On the other hand, their palms are up the whole time, which usually signals openness or honesty in body language—like they're trying to seem trustworthy. And they're not frowning or avoiding eye contact; they're actually looking right at the person they're talking to, which feels more like someone who's comfortable. If they were lying, I'd expect more nervous stuff like fidgeting or avoiding the gaze, but they're not doing that. The smile could just be them being polite or genuinely happy about whatever they're discussing. 

Honestly, I'm torn. The exaggerated eye closing makes me lean toward "maybe deception," but the palms-up and steady eye contact make me doubt it. Maybe they're just a very expressive person, or maybe they're nervous about being recorded, which could make them act a bit stiff. I don't think I'd call it a clear lie, but it's not totally convincing either. If I had to guess, I'd say it's *possible* they're hiding something, but I wouldn't bet on it—there are too many innocent explanations for what I'm seeing. It's one of those cases where you'd need to see more context to be sure.

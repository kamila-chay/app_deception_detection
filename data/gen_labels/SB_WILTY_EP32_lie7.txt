Looking at the clip, I’m really not sure if they’re lying or not—there’s a mix of things that could go either way. On one hand, they’re keeping their gaze directed at the person they’re talking to most of the time, which usually feels like someone trying to be honest, right? Like, if they were lying, I’d expect them to avoid eye contact more, but they’re actually looking at the other person a lot. They also have their arms open, which feels like they’re trying to seem approachable or genuine, not defensive. That part makes me lean toward them being truthful.  

But then there’s the shifting gaze—sometimes they look down, sometimes sideways, and not just once or twice. That’s the part that sticks out to me. I’ve heard that when people are uncomfortable or hiding something, they might glance away more, especially to the sides or down, like they’re avoiding the weight of the conversation. It’s not constant avoidance, but it’s there enough to make me wonder. And they’re not smiling or laughing at all, which feels a bit stiff—like they’re trying too hard to keep a neutral face, which sometimes happens when someone’s rehearsing a lie.  

On the flip side, maybe they’re just naturally a little reserved or nervous about the topic, not lying. People often look down when they’re thinking deeply or being respectful, not deceptive. And the open arms? That’s usually a sign of openness, so if they’re lying, they’d probably be more closed off, right? Like arms crossed or folded. But they’re not doing that at all.  

Honestly, it’s tricky. The cues don’t line up perfectly with what I’ve read about deception—like, the eye contact is actually *more* than I’d expect for a liar, but the gaze shifts feel off. I’d probably need to hear the actual words they’re saying to get a better sense, but based on just the body language, I’m torn. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s *possible* they’re lying, but it’s not clear-cut. They could just be a calm, thoughtful person who happens to look away while thinking. I wouldn’t bet on it either way.

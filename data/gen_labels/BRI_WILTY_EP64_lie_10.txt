After watching the clip a few times, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. The consistent smiling at first could suggest genuine friendliness or relaxation, but combined with the fact that they aren’t looking at the person they’re talking to, something feels off. Typically, avoiding eye contact can be a sign of deception, and here the smile doesn’t quite match the eyes—it seems like they’re trying to appear calm or friendly, but it doesn’t fully succeed. 

There’s no obvious nervous behavior, such as fidgeting or awkward pauses, which might make one think they’re telling the truth or at least comfortable. However, that absence of stress signs could just mean they’re skilled at hiding their deceit. The smile might be forced—the kind of grin that doesn’t reach the eyes—which is often a tactic when someone is trying to conceal dishonesty. Since the description doesn’t clarify whether the smile is genuine, this possibility raises suspicion.

Though I can’t be certain without more context, the mismatch between the smile and the gaze combined with the lack of other clear cues makes me lean slightly toward deception. It seems more likely that this is a case of someone masking their true feelings rather than simply being open and relaxed.

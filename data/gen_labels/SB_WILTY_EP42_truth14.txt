Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from watching, but I'll try to break it down based on what I see. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous smiles. They're actually keeping their arms open, which usually feels like someone being relaxed or honest in conversation, and they're making direct eye contact with whoever they're talking to most of the time. That makes me lean toward them being truthful, because liars often tense up or look away more. But then there's that chin moving downward a few times—like they're subtly lowering their chin while speaking—and they keep glancing sideways a bit, not just straight at the person. I've heard some people say sideways glances can signal deception, but honestly, I've also seen people do that when they're just thinking or recalling something, especially if they're not super nervous. The head moving forward and backward feels natural, like they're leaning in to engage, which doesn't scream "lying" to me.  

On the flip side, though, the lack of any nervous tells *could* be suspicious too—like, maybe they're too rehearsed or hiding it well. But the description says they're not smiling or laughing either, which is odd for someone who's just being friendly. Wait, no, that might not matter—it's not like truth-tellers always smile. Honestly, the more I watch, the more I think the open arms and steady eye contact outweigh the sideways glances. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those classic "tells" like touching their face or avoiding the gaze entirely, but they're not doing any of that. Still, I can't be 100% sure—people are complicated, and some liars are really good at faking calm. But based on what I'm seeing, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth, just because the behavior feels... unforced. Like they're not trying too hard to seem honest or hiding anything. It’s not a slam dunk, though—there’s always room for doubt.

Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd lean toward them possibly not being fully truthful based on what I'm seeing. The way they keep nodding while maintaining eye contact with the person they're talking to feels a bit too deliberate—like they're trying to seem cooperative, which sometimes happens when someone's rehearsing a story. Their raised eyebrows stand out too; that's often a sign of surprise or skepticism, but here it seems like it's happening while they're answering, which might mean they're mentally checking their own words. And the lip protrusion—like they're pouting slightly—just feels off for a calm conversation. I've noticed people do that when they're trying to seem innocent or hiding something, though I know that's not a sure sign.  

But here's where I hesitate: they're making consistent eye contact and nodding a lot, which are usually *more* associated with truthfulness, not lying. Liars often avoid eye contact or give stiff, unnatural nods, but this feels engaged. The chin moving up and down together also threw me off—it’s not a classic "lie" gesture, and it could just be them being expressive or nervous about the question, not necessarily deceptive. Plus, the head side-turning while talking is common for anyone thinking, not just liars.  

I keep going back to the lip thing though. It’s so specific and awkward—like they're unconsciously trying to control their mouth while speaking. If they were just being natural, I'd expect more relaxed mouth movements. But then again, maybe they're just a naturally expressive person, and I'm reading too much into it. Without knowing the context of the conversation or their usual behavior, it's really hard to say. I’d say it’s a maybe, leaning toward deception because of the combination of the lip movement and the slightly forced nodding, but I’d want to see more of the interaction before I’d feel confident. It’s not clear-cut at all.

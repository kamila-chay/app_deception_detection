Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'd lean toward this person being truthful, but I'm not 100% certain—it's really hard to tell just from body language alone. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which feels like they're engaged and not avoiding the conversation. Their arms are open, not crossed or folded, which usually reads as more relaxed and approachable—like they're not trying to shield themselves. And they're nodding along, which feels natural for someone agreeing or listening, not like a rehearsed "lie" gesture. The only thing that stood out a tiny bit was that slight downward movement of their chin—like a little head tilt or soft chin drop—but I'm not sure if that's just a natural habit or a micro-expression. Honestly, I've seen people do that when they're thinking or being sincere, not necessarily when lying.  

That said, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes people who are lying *do* keep their gaze steady or nod to seem calm, especially if they're practiced. And the chin thing could be misread—I've heard people say it's a sign of uncertainty, but it's super subtle. If they were stressed or nervous, I'd expect more fidgeting—like hands moving or blinking a lot—but there's none of that here. The lack of those classic "nervous" signs actually makes it feel less like a lie to me. But yeah, I'm not ruling out the possibility they're just really good at hiding it, or maybe they're being polite without lying. Honestly, in real life, I'd probably just trust the vibe they're giving off—open posture, steady eyes, no red flags—and go with truth, but I'd still wonder if they're just naturally calm. It's not a slam dunk, but it feels more like honesty than deception based on what I'm watching.

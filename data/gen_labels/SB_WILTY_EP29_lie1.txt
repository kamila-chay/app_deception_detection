Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm really not sure if they're lying or not—there are a few things that stand out, but it's tricky to pin down. They keep making this exaggerated mouth opening, like they're really stretching their lips wide when they talk, which sometimes happens when people are trying to seem more expressive or maybe even a bit nervous. And their lips are consistently pulled down at the corners, which feels like they're genuinely upset or uncomfortable about whatever they're saying. That makes me wonder if they're stressed about the topic, not necessarily lying.  

But then there's the way they keep glancing sideways instead of straight at the person they're talking to, and their head's tilted to the side a bit. I've heard that sideways glances can sometimes mean someone's distracted or thinking hard, which *could* be a sign they're fabricating something. They also maintain eye contact with the person directly—like, they're not avoiding their gaze entirely—which usually leans toward truthfulness, but I know some liars work extra hard to keep eye contact to seem credible.  

On the flip side, though, the exaggerated mouth thing might just be their natural way of speaking—some people just talk with big mouth movements, and the downturned lips could just mean they're genuinely sad about the situation, not lying. The head tilt feels like a nervous habit, not necessarily deceptive. Honestly, it's really hard to tell because people express emotions so differently. If they were lying, I'd expect more obvious signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, but they're not doing that. They seem pretty still otherwise, which is confusing.  

So yeah, I'm leaning a little toward them being truthful—maybe they're just really uncomfortable about what they're saying—but I'm not at all certain. It could easily be that they're stressed about the topic, and the "exaggerated" stuff is just how they talk. I'd need more context to feel confident about it.

Based on the video, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, although I’m not completely certain. The exaggerated way they open their mouth—almost stretching their lips wide—could be a sign of trying too hard to appear expressive or convincing, which sometimes happens when someone is being deceptive. Their lips are consistently pulled down at the corners, which might suggest genuine discomfort, but it could also indicate stress from fabricating a story.  

Their sideways glances and slightly tilted head raise some suspicion as well. While sideways looks can mean distraction or deep thought, they can also be cues that someone is being evasive or trying to construct something untrue. The fact that they maintain eye contact complicates things—it might point toward truthfulness, but some people who lie deliberately keep steady eye contact to seem credible.  

It’s possible that these behaviors are just natural habits—some people speak with big mouth movements and get nervous regardless of honesty. However, the combination of these subtle signs makes me lean toward the idea that they might not be fully truthful. The absence of more obvious signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting is confusing, but it doesn’t rule out deception entirely. Overall, I’m inclined to think they’re probably lying, or at least not telling the whole truth, though it’s hard to be sure without more context.

Looking at the clip, I'm trying to figure out if they're being truthful or not, but honestly, it's a bit tricky. The person seems pretty calm overall—no obvious fidgeting, no weird pauses, and they're actually making direct eye contact with whoever's talking to them. That usually leans toward truth-telling, right? Like, when people lie, they often avoid eye contact or look away, but here they're holding it steady. Plus, their hands are open—palms up, which people sometimes do when they're trying to seem honest or open. I've seen that gesture before, and it can feel like they're saying, "Hey, I'm not hiding anything."  

But then there's the eyebrow thing. They keep raising their eyebrows a lot, like they're genuinely surprised or confused by the question. Now, that *could* be a sign of stress—sometimes people do that when they're lying and trying to seem innocent—but it also just looks like they're reacting naturally to what's being said. Like, maybe they're just processing the question, not trying to cover up something. And honestly, the lack of other signs is confusing. No forced smiles, no lip biting, no scratching, no blinking like crazy—that's usually what I'd expect if someone was lying under pressure. They seem relaxed, which makes me wonder if they're just being truthful and the raised eyebrows are just a habit.  

On the flip side, though, maybe they're *too* calm. Like, sometimes people who lie rehearse their answers and act way too composed, so the lack of nervousness might actually be suspicious. And the palms up—while it *looks* open—could be a calculated move to seem trustworthy, like they're trying too hard. I mean, I've heard that some liars use open gestures to distract from other tells. But then again, if they were really lying, I'd expect more signs of tension, like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. The fact that they're not doing that makes me lean toward "they're probably telling the truth," but I'm not 100% sure.  

Honestly, it's hard to say for certain. The cues are kind of mixed—some things point to truth, others could be misinterpreted. If I had to guess, I'd say it's more likely they're being honest, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. People are complicated, and this clip doesn't scream "deception" to me like others I've seen. Maybe the raised eyebrows are just how they talk, and the palms up is just a natural gesture. I guess I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want to see more context before I'd be confident.

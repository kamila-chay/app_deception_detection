Honestly, it's really hard to say for sure just from watching the video, and I'd want to see more context to be confident. What stands out to me is how they're holding their body—arms are wide open, which usually feels like someone trying to seem approachable or honest, not deceptive. But then there's that tightness around the mouth: lips pulled back, corners downturned, almost like they're biting their lip or holding in something. That *could* look like stress, which people often associate with lying. And their eyes keep going down and sideways instead of meeting the camera, which might make someone think they're avoiding accountability.

But here's where I start doubting that angle: the open arms feel like a strong counterpoint. If they were actively lying, I'd expect more defensive gestures—arms crossed, hands covering the face, maybe fidgeting—but there's none of that. The tension in the mouth could just be them being nervous about being recorded, or maybe they're just naturally expressive when they're thinking hard. I've seen people look away or have tense expressions when they're genuinely trying to remember something, not when they're making it up. Plus, the "lips retracted" thing—like they're pulling their lips back tight—might just be their default face when they're concentrating, not a sign of deception.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, the avoidance of eye contact might make sense as a common (though not universal) sign, but I've also heard that people who lie often overcompensate with too much eye contact or forced smiles, which isn't happening here. The lack of any nervous ticks—like blinking a lot or touching their face—also feels off for someone who's being deceptive, since lying often triggers those physical reactions in people. But honestly, that's not always true either; some people are really good at controlling their body language.

So yeah, I'm leaning toward them being truthful, but I can't rule out that the mouth tension is just them being uncomfortable in the moment. It's not like they're giving a textbook "liar" performance, and the open arms really stick with me as a positive sign. But I'd still want to hear the full context—what they're saying, the situation—to feel more certain. Without that, it's just a gut feeling based on what I see, and gut feelings can be wrong. I'd say the evidence points more toward truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

Watching the clip, I noticed a few things that made me pause. The person was frowning pretty consistently, especially around the eyebrows, and their lips were kind of pushed out like they were holding something in—almost like they were trying to keep their mouth from saying something. They kept looking directly at the person asking the question, which is interesting because I’ve heard people say liars avoid eye contact, but here they’re locked in. They also nodded a few times while speaking, which felt a bit too deliberate, like they were trying to seem agreeable. And they kept touching their head or face with their hands—just a quick brush, like they were adjusting something or trying to calm themselves down.  

On the flip side, they didn’t smile or laugh at all, which makes me wonder if they were just genuinely annoyed or stressed about the topic. Sometimes people get that tight-faced look when they’re thinking hard or frustrated, not necessarily lying. The lack of exaggerated gestures—like no wide eyes or frantic blinking—also feels off for a classic "lie" stereotype. If they were making it up, I’d expect more nervous ticks, but this seems quieter, maybe more internal.  

Honestly, I’m not totally sure. The frown and lip-pushing could be stress from the question itself, like they’re upset about what they’re being asked, not hiding something. But the hand-touching and steady eye contact? That’s the part that nags at me. It’s not textbook lying behavior, but it’s not clear-cut truth either. I’d lean toward them maybe not being fully honest, but it’s really ambiguous. Like, they could just be a naturally serious person who’s uncomfortable with the line of questioning. I’d need more context to feel confident either way.

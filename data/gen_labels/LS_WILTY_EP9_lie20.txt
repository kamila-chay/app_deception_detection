Hmm, this is tricky to judge just from the video alone. Watching them, I notice a few things that make me lean toward them not being deceptive, but I'm not totally sure. They have this really noticeable raised eyebrow and exaggerated eye opening—like they're trying to look extra attentive or maybe even a bit surprised? That sometimes happens when people are stressed, not necessarily lying. And their chin is moving upward a bit, which feels a bit odd, like they're holding their jaw tense. But then, they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to, which I'd usually expect from someone being honest, not someone dodging the truth. Their arms are open too, which feels like they're trying to seem approachable or genuine, not defensive. 

On the flip side, the gaze down a couple times and that head tilt could read as nervousness or maybe even a bit of discomfort—sometimes people look down when they're rehearsing what to say, which *could* hint at deception. But I've seen people do that when they're just thinking deeply or being polite, not necessarily lying. And the raised eyebrows... yeah, that's a classic "deception cue" in some studies, but I've also seen it when someone's genuinely confused or trying to process something. 

The thing that makes me doubt the "deception" label though is the open arms and the direct gaze. If they were lying, I'd expect more avoidance—like looking away more, or crossing arms, or fidgeting. Here, they seem pretty engaged, even if they're a little tense. Maybe they're just nervous about the situation, not lying. Like, I've been in interviews where I'd do all those things—raised eyebrows, squinting a bit—because I was trying too hard to seem calm and truthful. So honestly, it feels like maybe the label is off, or maybe they're just a really anxious person, not a liar. But I can't rule out deception entirely either. It's hard to say for sure without knowing what they're talking about or their normal behavior. I'd say it's probably not deception, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it—just seems like someone who's a bit worked up, not necessarily hiding something.

Honestly, I'm watching this clip and trying to figure it out, but I'm not totally sure. The person seems really calm while talking—no frowning, no weird mouth movements, no frantic blinking, which honestly makes me lean toward them being truthful. When they're speaking, they're actually looking directly at the person they're talking to (not avoiding eye contact), and they're nodding along like they're engaged. That feels natural for someone telling the truth, right? Like, if they were making it up, I'd expect more nervous energy—maybe glancing away a lot or fidgeting with their hands. But here, they're just... steady. Their eyebrows are raised a bit, which I think might just be them being attentive or thinking, not necessarily lying. And that little chin lift? It seems like they're emphasizing something, not trying to hide it.  

But yeah, I can see why someone might doubt it. Sometimes people who lie *do* keep eye contact to seem honest, and the raised eyebrows could be a way to look innocent. Or maybe the chin movement is just a habit, not a clue. I know deception detection isn't perfect—some people are just naturally calm under pressure, especially if they're used to being on camera. Like, maybe they're rehearsed or just very confident in what they're saying. I'm not gonna say for sure, but based on what I'm seeing? The lack of obvious nervous tells (no lip biting, no scratching, no awkward pauses) makes it feel more truthful to me than not. It just doesn't *look* like the kind of behavior that screams "lying." But I'm not ruling it out completely—sometimes the best liars look the most relaxed. So yeah, I'd guess truth, but with a healthy "maybe" in the back of my mind.

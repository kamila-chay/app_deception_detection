Looking at this clip, I'm honestly not sure if they're lying or not—body language is tricky, and I know it's super easy to misread things. They seem really calm the whole time, like they're not fidgeting at all or showing any obvious nervousness. No blinking too fast, no awkward pauses, no signs of stress like frowning or touching their face. That kind of stillness might make me lean toward "truth" because when people lie, they often do *something*—like shifting in their seat or avoiding eye contact—but here they're just... sitting there quietly. It feels almost too composed, like they're not even trying to hide anything.  

But then I think, "Wait, maybe that's the *point*—some people are just naturally calm, especially if they're used to being on camera or if they're really good at controlling themselves." I've heard stories about people who lie without seeming nervous, like actors or politicians. And honestly, they *weren't* making eye contact (the description says "gaze towards interlocutor" is false), which some people associate with lying, but I've read that's not reliable—some folks just don't look directly at the camera when they're relaxed, not because they're hiding something.  

So yeah, I'd probably guess they're telling the truth just based on how steady they seem, but I'd hesitate to say for sure. Like, if it was a high-stakes situation, I might wonder if they're just really good at faking it. But since there's no evidence of stress or deception in the video itself—no raised eyebrows, no lip biting, nothing—I can't really point to a "tell." It's just... quiet. And quiet doesn't always mean truthful, but it also doesn't scream "lying" either. I'd say it's probably truth, but I'd want more context before I'd feel confident about it.

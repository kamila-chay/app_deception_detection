Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone. I watched the clip a couple times, and honestly, I'm not totally convinced they're lying, but I can't rule it out either. The thing that stands out most is how they're actually holding eye contact with the person they're talking to—gaze towards interlocutor is definitely happening, which feels a bit off for someone who's trying to hide something. Usually, people who are deceptive avoid direct eye contact, so that makes me lean toward them being truthful, at least a little. But then there's that sideways glance they do a couple times—gaze sideways is marked as true—and the eyebrows raised a few times. I've heard people say raised eyebrows can be a sign of surprise or even trying to seem innocent when lying, so that part makes me pause. 

On the flip side, though, they're not doing any of the classic nervous tells: no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact entirely, no weird smiles or awkward pauses. They seem pretty calm, just a bit thoughtful with those sideways looks. Maybe they're just recalling something or feeling a little hesitant, which happens when people are being honest too—like when you're trying to remember details clearly. The raised eyebrows might just be a natural reaction to the question, not a calculated lie. I keep wondering if the sideways glance is because they're looking at something behind the camera or just processing what they're saying, not because they're lying. 

But here's where I'm stuck: if they *were* lying, why wouldn't they show more signs? Like, why no blinking more than usual or shifting in their seat? The absence of those cues feels more telling than the eyebrow thing. I guess I'm more inclined to think they're being truthful, but I'd want to see more context—like what they're actually saying—to be sure. It's not a clear-cut case, though. Maybe they're just a naturally expressive person who raises their eyebrows a lot, or maybe they're just tired. Either way, the video doesn't scream "deception" to me like I'd expect it to if they were lying. I'd say it's probably truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.

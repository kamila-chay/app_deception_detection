Hmm, this is a bit tricky to call just from the video alone, but after watching the clip a few times, I’m leaning slightly toward the idea that the person might be lying. They do maintain eye contact with the person they’re talking to, which typically suggests honesty since liars often avoid direct gaze. However, the sideways glances they make a couple of times stand out—they can be a subtle sign of deception or discomfort. Raised eyebrows are also present, and while those can indicate surprise or innocence, they might also be an attempt to seem more believable, which gives me pause.

They don’t show the usual nervous signs like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or awkward smiles, and they seem fairly calm, which could mean they’re just recalling information. But calmness can sometimes be a mask, especially if someone is trying to control their behavior to avoid suspicion. The absence of overt signs of nervousness doesn’t necessarily rule out deception; some people are quite practiced at hiding it.

The sideways glances might be due to processing the question or looking at something off-camera, but combined with the raised eyebrows, I find it hard to fully dismiss the possibility they’re not being entirely truthful. While it’s definitely not a slam dunk, and they could just be naturally expressive or tired, overall, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be hiding something, even if it’s not blatant. So, while I wouldn’t be certain, I do lean somewhat toward deception here.

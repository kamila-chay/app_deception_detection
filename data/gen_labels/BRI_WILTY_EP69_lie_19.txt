Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm a bit torn on whether they're lying or not—it's not super clear-cut. The person isn't smiling or laughing, which might make you think they're being serious, but they're also not showing obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact *completely*. Wait, actually, they *are* avoiding eye contact—they keep looking down, not at the person they're talking to. That's a bit of a red flag because I've noticed in other videos, people who are lying often glance away or look down instead of meeting someone's eyes. And they're raising their eyebrows a lot, which sometimes happens when someone's trying to seem surprised or innocent, but it can also just be a nervous habit.  

But here's where I hesitate: looking down doesn't *always* mean lying. I've seen people do that when they're just thinking deeply, feeling shy, or even distracted—like if they're trying to remember something. And they're not doing any of the other classic "lie signs" we hear about: no awkward pauses, no lip biting, no hands covering their face, nothing. If they were really lying, I'd expect more of those little tells, like fidgeting or over-explaining. Maybe they're just naturally quiet or uncomfortable in the moment.  

The eyebrows thing is tricky too. Raising them could be genuine surprise—like, "Wait, did you really say that?"—or it could be a way to seem more engaged while they're trying to fabricate a story. But without more context, it's hard to tell. I guess I'm leaning a bit toward deception because of the consistent gaze down, but I'm not 100% sure. It feels like maybe they're hiding something, but it could just be their normal way of talking. Honestly, it's one of those cases where you'd need more to go on—like the actual question they're answering or how they act in other parts of the video—to feel confident either way. For now, I'd say it's possible they're not telling the whole truth, but I wouldn't bet on it without more evidence.

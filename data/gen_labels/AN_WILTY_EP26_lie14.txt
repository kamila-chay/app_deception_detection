Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm trying to figure out if this person is being truthful or not. Honestly, it's a bit tricky because some of the cues seem mixed. On one hand, they're making consistent eye contact with the person they're talking to—that usually feels like a sign of honesty, right? People who lie sometimes avoid looking directly at you, so that part makes me lean toward them telling the truth. And their palms are up, which is often seen as open and non-threatening, like they're trying to seem genuine.  

But then there are these other little things that make me pause. Their lips are pulled back, like they're tensing their mouth, and their chin is moving upward—almost like they're trying to hold themselves together. I've noticed that when people are stressed or nervous, especially when they might be hiding something, they do things like that. Their hands are also touching their head or neck a few times, which feels like a classic sign of anxiety. And that head shake? It’s subtle, but it seems like they’re dismissing something they’re saying, which can happen when someone’s trying to cover up a lie.  

Still, I can’t be sure. Maybe they’re just naturally expressive or really stressed about the situation for a different reason—like they’re nervous about the whole conversation, not necessarily lying. The absence of smiling or laughing could just mean they’re serious, not deceptive. And the fact that they’re maintaining eye contact and keeping their palms up makes me think they’re trying to seem trustworthy, which could mean they’re actually being honest but just anxious.  

Honestly, I’m not completely sure. The stress cues (lips retracted, chin movement, hand gestures) are making me lean toward deception, but the eye contact and open palms are pulling me the other way. It’s not clear-cut. If I had to guess, I’d say it’s *possible* they’re being deceptive, but it’s really hard to tell without more context. Maybe they’re just a nervous person, or maybe they’re lying. I’d need to see more of the conversation to feel confident.

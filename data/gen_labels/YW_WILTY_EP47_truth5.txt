Looking at the video, I'm trying to piece together whether this person seems truthful or not, and honestly? It's a bit tricky. They're definitely holding steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to—that's a solid sign they're not avoiding the conversation, which sometimes happens when people are hiding something. Their posture feels open too, arms wide and palms facing up like they're being transparent, which usually leans toward honesty. And that shrug at the end? It doesn't feel defensive or evasive—it’s more like they're saying, "I don't know, but I'm being straight with you."  

But then there's the frowning. They've got those eyebrows pulled down the whole time, which I'd usually associate with stress or disagreement, not lying. Maybe they're just genuinely frustrated about the topic, though, not trying to deceive. I keep wondering if the head turning sideways is a nervous habit—sometimes people do that when they're thinking, but it’s not like they're looking away or avoiding the person. The fact that they're still meeting the gaze while doing it makes me think it's just natural movement, not a red flag.  

On the flip side, I can see why someone might doubt it. Frowning *can* be a sign of internal conflict when lying, and if they were being deceptive, I'd expect more signs like fidgeting or shifting eyes. But here, they're not doing any of that—no quick glances down, no lip biting, just steady focus. The open hands and arms really stand out to me; when people are hiding something, they often cross their arms or cover their mouth, which isn't happening here.  

Honestly, the more I watch, the more it feels like they're just being earnest. The frown might just be because the situation's heavy or they're processing something, not because they're lying. But I won't pretend I'm 100% sure—body language can be tricky, and without knowing the context, it's hard to rule out everything. Still, all the cues I'm seeing point more toward truth than deception. I'd lean toward them telling the truth, but yeah, I'd want to hear the full story before I'd call it a slam dunk.

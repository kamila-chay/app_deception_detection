This is quite tricky, but after watching the clip, I’m leaning slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive. They don’t show the usual nervous signs like laughing, scowling, lip biting, or rubbing their hands, which might suggest truthfulness; however, the absence of these signs could also mean they’re deliberately controlling their behavior to appear calm. The frequent raising of eyebrows feels a bit off—it might be a natural reaction to the question, but it can also signal uncertainty or an attempt to fake surprise. Their chin moving up and down is subtle but noticeable, and that type of repetitive motion might hint at underlying stress or nervousness, even if it could also just be a habitual gesture. 

The gaze looking upward is interesting because it’s often connected with memory recall, which would typically suggest honesty, yet some research shows this might not apply universally, and some deceptive individuals could use this as a tactic. Considering all this, the lack of overt stress signs might actually be a sign that the person is trying hard not to reveal anything, which can itself be suspicious. I’m not fully convinced they’re lying, but there are enough subtle cues that make me lean more toward the possibility they’re not being entirely truthful. It’s a cautious judgment, though—I’d need more context or conversation to be surer.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm watching the clip, and honestly, I'm not totally sure. The person doesn't seem super fidgety or obviously nervous—no laughing, no scowling, no lip biting or hands rubbing. That makes me wonder if they're being truthful, because liars often show more physical signs of stress. But then again, some people are really good at hiding it, so the lack of obvious nervousness doesn't *prove* they're telling the truth.

What stands out to me is that they keep raising their eyebrows a lot—like, really noticeable. And their chin is moving up and down, almost like they're nodding slightly but not actually moving their head. I've heard some people say raised eyebrows can be a sign of uncertainty or maybe even deception, like they're trying to seem surprised or processing something. But I also know that raising eyebrows can just be a natural reaction to a question, especially if it's unexpected. Like, if someone asks you a weird question, you might just instinctively raise your eyebrows without lying.

Then there's the gaze—they're looking up a lot, not at the person talking to them. I think I read somewhere that looking up is often linked to recalling memories, which is usually associated with truth-telling, not lying. But I'm not 100% sure about that—some studies say it could be the opposite for some people, or maybe it depends on the culture. So that *could* be a sign they're being honest, but it's not definitive.

The chin movement is really confusing me. Moving the chin up and down... it's subtle, but it's there. Sometimes that kind of small, repetitive movement can be a nervous tic, like when someone's stressed. But it could also just be a habit—maybe they always do that when they're thinking. I can't tell if it's intentional or just how they talk.

On the flip side, if they *were* lying, they might be trying *too* hard to seem calm, so the lack of obvious signs could actually be a red flag. Like, if they're putting in effort to not seem nervous, that might mean they're hiding something. But then again, if they're just a relaxed person, it might not mean anything.

Honestly, I'm leaning a little more toward them being truthful because of the gaze up and the absence of classic "lie signs" like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting. But I'm not confident at all. It's really hard to say for sure without knowing the context of the question or what they're being asked. Maybe the question was simple, and they're just thinking carefully. Or maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show stress. I'd need to see more of the conversation to feel better about it. Right now, I'm just not sure—could go either way.

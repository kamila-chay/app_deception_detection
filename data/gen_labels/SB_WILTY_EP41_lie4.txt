Looking at the clip, I'm really not 100% sure, but I'm leaning towards them not being entirely truthful based on what I'm seeing. The way they keep frowning and their chin keeps dipping down like they're trying to hide or push something away—it feels tense. And that frequent blinking? It’s way more than normal, like they’re really struggling to hold eye contact. They’re nodding, which usually feels like agreement, but their gaze keeps sliding sideways instead of meeting the other person directly, and they’re turning their head a bit to the side while talking. That sideways glance and the head tilt feels like they’re avoiding the question, not really engaging.

But honestly, I’m not totally convinced. Maybe they’re just really uncomfortable with the topic—like if they’re talking about something awkward or upsetting, that frowning and the chin movement could just be them processing it, not lying. The blinking might even be from the lights in the room or dry eyes, not deception. And they *are* looking at the other person sometimes, which makes me wonder if the sideways glance is just a natural habit for them, not a sign of hiding something. Sometimes people shift their gaze when they’re concentrating, not lying. I’ve seen people do that when they’re trying to think of the right words, not when they’re being deceptive.

It’s tricky because all these little cues can mean different things. The head turning and the frown make me think there’s something off, but I can’t rule out that they’re just nervous or distracted. If I had to guess based on the video alone, I’d say it’s *possible* they’re being deceptive, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it. It’s the kind of thing where you’d need more context—like what they’re actually talking about—to be sure. For now, I’d say the behavior feels uneasy, but I’m not ready to call it a lie outright.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky to judge just from the video, but I'll try to walk through what I'm seeing. The person is laughing a few times while talking, which feels a bit unusual for someone who's clearly lying—they often seem tense or forced, but here the laughter seems relaxed, like they're genuinely amused by what they're saying. They're also making consistent eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which is usually a good sign for truth-telling—liars often avoid direct gaze, but they're looking right at the person, even if they glance down occasionally. That down-gaze might just mean they're thinking or recalling something, not necessarily hiding something.  

I also notice they're shaking their head side-to-side a couple of times, like when they're emphasizing "no" or disagreeing with something, but since they're talking about their own experience, it feels more like natural agreement rather than a lie. And honestly, they don't seem nervous at all—no fidgeting, no touching their face, no awkward pauses. If they were lying, I'd expect more of those little tells, like rubbing their hands or avoiding eye contact. But here, they're just sitting there, relaxed, laughing, and speaking clearly.  

That said, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe they're a really good liar who doesn't show signs, or maybe the laughter is actually nervous—it can be hard to tell sometimes. And the head turning to the side? Could be a habit, not a clue. But honestly, the lack of tension in their body language stands out more than anything. Most people who're lying would seem off-kilter, but this feels like someone just telling a story they're comfortable with. I'm leaning toward truth, but I'd want to hear the actual words to be sure. It just feels... natural, you know? Like they're not trying to hide anything.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though I'm not entirely sure. Their tense demeanor—the scowl on their face and the way their lip corners are pulled down—suggests frustration or annoyance, which could be a cover for deception. The tightly crossed arms come off as a defensive posture, as if they're shutting things down emotionally. The slight head tilt seems like an attempt to appear thoughtful, but it feels somewhat unnatural, as if they're trying to convince rather than genuinely process.

However, they maintain steady eye contact with the person speaking, which is often seen as a sign of honesty since many liars tend to avoid eye contact. They don’t show some of the typical nervous signs, like increased blinking or fidgeting, which would point more clearly to deception. This makes things a bit confusing.

Still, the defensive body language combined with the forced expressions might indicate they are uncomfortable with the situation in a way that suggests they could be hiding something. While the steady eye contact is a reason to hesitate before concluding deception, it’s possible they’re skilled at maintaining eye contact to mask dishonesty or are simply masking their feelings out of frustration. Given these mixed signals, I would cautiously lean towards the possibility that they are not telling the truth, though it’s far from certain.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I'm not entirely sure if they're lying or not. They seem pretty tense—there's a clear scowl on their face, and their lip corners are pulled down like they're annoyed or frustrated, not smiling at all. They're also got their arms crossed tightly over their chest, which usually feels like a defensive posture, like they're shutting things down. And they keep tilting their head a little to the side, almost like they're processing something but in a way that feels... off? Like they're trying to seem thoughtful but it's not quite natural.

But here's where I'm hesitating. They're looking right at the person talking to them the whole time—no glancing away, no avoiding eye contact. I've heard a lot of people say liars don't make eye contact, so that actually makes me lean toward them being truthful. If they were lying, I'd expect them to look away or fidget more, but they're not doing that. They're not blinking a lot, not covering their mouth, not rubbing their hands—those are the classic "nervous liar" signs I've seen in other videos, and they're missing here. 

On the flip side, the scowl and crossed arms could just mean they're genuinely upset about the question, not that they're lying. Maybe they're mad the person is asking it, or they're annoyed with the situation, not the content. The head tilt might be a natural habit for them when they're concentrating, not a sign of deception. And honestly, people can look angry or defensive without lying—they might just be stressed or frustrated with the topic. 

I think the strongest point against deception is the steady eye contact. If they were lying, I'd expect more of that classic "avoiding gaze" behavior, but they're holding it. But I'm not ruling it out completely—maybe they're so practiced at lying they don't look away, or maybe they're just really angry about being asked. It's hard to say without knowing the context of the conversation. Honestly, I'd say it's probably not deception, but I'm not 100% sure. It feels more like they're just uncomfortable or annoyed, not actively hiding something. But I could be wrong—I've been fooled before by people who looked calm but were lying. It's tricky!

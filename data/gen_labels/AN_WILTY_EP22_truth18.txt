Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person seems pretty composed while speaking. They're maintaining steady eye contact with whoever they're talking to, which usually feels like a sign of honesty to me—like they're not avoiding looking at the person they're addressing. Plus, they're leaning in slightly with their head moving forward, which often comes off as engaged or sincere, not like someone who's trying to hide something. I don't see any of the usual nervous tells: no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no forced smiles or frowns, and their eyes aren't darting around like they might be scrambling for a story.  

That said, I'm not totally convinced it's a slam dunk for truth. I know some people who are really good at lying can mimic calm behavior—like practicing eye contact or staying still to seem believable. Maybe they're just naturally low-key or rehearsed, and the lack of "tells" doesn't *prove* they're honest. It could also be that they're not stressed because they're confident in their story, not necessarily because it's true. I've heard that people who lie often try too hard to seem relaxed, but here it just looks... normal. Like they're just talking casually, not performing.  

Honestly, the absence of any red flags makes me lean toward truth, but I'd hesitate to say it's 100% certain. If I were to guess based on this alone, I'd say they're probably telling the truth, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. It feels like the kind of behavior where if they *were* lying, they'd be doing a really good job of it, and if they're telling the truth, they're just being their usual self. Without more context—like what they're even talking about—it's hard to say for sure, but the video doesn't give me any reason to doubt them right now.

Honestly, I'm not totally sure, but based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I'm leaning toward them telling the truth. The way they're sitting with their arms open and actually looking directly at the person they're talking to—well, that feels pretty natural for someone being honest. I've noticed in a lot of videos, people who are lying often cross their arms or avoid eye contact, but here they're not doing any of that. Their chin is moving up a bit, which sometimes happens when someone's thinking carefully, not necessarily hiding something. And they're not fidgeting with their hands or blinking a lot—those are things I'd expect if they were nervous about lying.

But here's where I hesitate: that lip protrusion thing is a bit confusing. I've seen people do that when they're concentrating or even just a little annoyed, not always when they're lying. And the awkward pauses—sometimes people pause when they're trying to remember something accurately, but other times it's because they're making up a story. The sideways glance too... I know some people look sideways when they're thinking, but others do it when they're avoiding truth. It's hard to tell without knowing their usual habits.

I guess the biggest thing is that there's just no obvious "lie" body language here. No scowling, no raised eyebrows, no covering their mouth—those are the classic cues I'd look for. If they were lying, I'd expect at least one of those signs, especially since the conversation seems straightforward. But I'm not saying it's proof they're truthful, just that it doesn't look like they're trying to hide anything. Honestly, I'd probably say "truth" based on this, but I'd still be curious to hear the full context or see more of their usual behavior. It could be they're just a calm person who naturally pauses a lot, and that's why it feels honest.

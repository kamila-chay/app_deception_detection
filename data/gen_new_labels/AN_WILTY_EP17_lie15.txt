After watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it’s not a certainty. The strong scowl is the first thing that stands out—it’s a pretty serious, tight expression that doesn’t quite fit with someone just being openly honest. While people scowl for various reasons, in this context it raises a bit of suspicion since it often signals stress or discomfort, which can hint at deception.

What complicates things is the eye contact: he maintains steady, almost unwavering gaze with the questioner, which traditionally suggests honesty. He also nods along as he speaks, which usually indicates engagement and agreement. These behaviors aren’t typical of someone who’s fabricating answers, at least according to common assumptions about lying. Plus, he doesn’t show any of the usual physical signs of nervousness like fidgeting or awkward pauses, which would further support truthfulness.

Still, the scowl feels off, like it could be masking something deeper. Someone who’s lying might try to keep a neutral or less negative expression, especially if the lie is about something straightforward. The lack of physical nervousness might mean he’s practiced, or it could just be that he’s intentionally controlling his demeanor to appear calm. That steady eye contact could be a deliberate tactic rather than a genuine sign of honesty.

In the end, while some cues point toward sincerity, the persistent negative expression combined with the overall vibe makes me lean slightly toward believing he’s not being entirely truthful. It’s not a strong conclusion, but given the mixed signals, I would suspect there’s some level of deception at play here. More context or footage would definitely help clarify things, but based on what’s here, I tend to lean toward doubt rather than full trust.

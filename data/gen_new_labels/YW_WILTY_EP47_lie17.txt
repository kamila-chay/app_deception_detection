Watching this clip, I can't help but notice the smile combined with the head shake, and it strikes me as somewhat incongruent. Typically, when someone sincerely disagrees or says no, especially in response to a serious question, they don’t smile; the smile here feels somewhat forced, as if it’s an attempt to soften the negativity or mask discomfort. The raised eyebrows and head tilting add to this uneasy mix, giving the impression that the person is trying to appear thoughtful or surprised, but the head shake contradicts that, making their reaction seem less natural.

On the other hand, it’s possible that this person is simply expressive and habitually smiles, even when disagreeing. Their palms-up gesture and shrug could signal openness or an attempt to seem innocent, and maintaining eye contact tends to indicate honesty rather than deception. If they were lying, you might expect more signs like avoiding gaze or fidgeting, which aren’t present here. The head shake might just be a reflexive way to say no without any deeper meaning, particularly if they’re responding to an uncomfortable question.

Still, the mix of a smile with a head shake and raised eyebrows feels like an overcompensation, as though they’re aware their answer might come across negatively and try to mitigate that with friendliness. While it could just be their usual mannerisms, I’m inclined to think there might be some level of deception going on because the gestures don’t fully align with a straightforward denial. I wouldn’t say it’s certain, but the signs tilt toward them not being entirely truthful. More context about the question might clarify things, but for now, I lean toward suspicion rather than clear honesty.

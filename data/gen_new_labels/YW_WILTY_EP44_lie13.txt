While it's difficult to be completely certain from just watching the clip, there are some subtle signs that make me lean toward thinking the person might not be entirely truthful. Their constant gaze on the person they're speaking to is unusual because people who lie often avoid eye contact or show nervous fidgeting, which wasn’t present here. However, their occasional awkward pauses, raised eyebrows, and closed mouth could suggest they were caught off guard or possibly trying to carefully construct their story. These moments feel a bit unnatural and might indicate hesitation or fabrication rather than mere nervousness. Although their slight head tilt and faint smile appear sincere, those subtle cues don’t fully outweigh the pauses and raised brows, which are somewhat telling. Overall, while it’s not definite, the combination of these signs suggests they may be leaning towards deception rather than being fully honest.

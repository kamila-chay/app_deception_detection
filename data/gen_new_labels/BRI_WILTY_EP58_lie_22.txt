Watching the clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful, though I'm not completely sure. They raise their eyebrows consistently throughout the conversation, and it feels somewhat unnatural—more like a held expression than a spontaneous reaction. Their gaze mostly stays on the person they're speaking to, but there's this subtle sideways glance now and then, which stands out because it’s not the usual avoidance of eye contact you’d expect from someone lying, yet it also doesn’t feel like completely relaxed interaction.

The steady eye contact could be an attempt to appear sincere, as some people do that when they’re trying to hide something. While raised eyebrows might simply be a reaction to what’s said, here they persist even during neutral topics, suggesting possible overcompensation. The sideways glances could indicate they’re mentally elsewhere, perhaps rehearsing responses or checking their surroundings, rather than being fully engaged. They’re not showing obvious signs like fidgeting or forced smiles, which makes the cues more subtle.

Given these factors, especially the combination of raised eyebrows and that subtle sideways gaze, I tend to suspect that they might be leaning toward deception. However, since these behaviors can also be individual quirks, I wouldn’t say it’s definitive. Overall, I lean toward the belief that they may not be fully truthful, but I’d need more context to feel more certain—it’s not a clear-cut case, but it raises enough doubt to make me question their honesty.

It’s difficult to be completely certain just from watching, but I tend to think they might not be telling the whole truth. Their smile and the way they raise their eyebrows seem somewhat forced, as if they’re trying too hard to appear at ease. The head tilting and sideways glances while they speak feel a bit unusual for someone being straightforward—almost like they’re carefully choosing their words. The slight upward movement of the chin when they say certain things also stands out; it looks like they’re bracing themselves, which can be a sign of preparing a story rather than speaking freely.

That said, there are some conflicting signals. They keep their arms open and maintain direct eye contact, which are generally signs of engagement and honesty. If they were lying, I’d expect more closed-off body language or avoidance of eye contact. Their smile doesn’t seem entirely fake, though it’s tight and controlled—possibly a sign of nervousness about the topic rather than outright deception. The head shaking might just be a habitual gesture and not necessarily an indication of lying.

It’s worth considering that some people are naturally expressive and use lots of head and eyebrow movements even when they’re truthful, so this could just be their usual mannerisms. Their consistent eye contact might also suggest they are trying to be present and sincere.

Overall, I’d say it leans more toward them being deceptive based on these subtle facial expressions and odd head movements, but it could very well be personality quirks or anxiety. Without additional information, it’s hard to be sure. I’d want to see more of the interaction or hear their words more clearly before making a firm judgment. Still, based on what I’m observing, I’m inclined to view their statements with some suspicion.

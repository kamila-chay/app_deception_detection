This is a bit complex, but watching the clip, the person's calm demeanor and steady eye contact might initially suggest honesty. However, the repeated upward glances catch my attention. While looking up can simply mean recalling information, it’s also sometimes associated with fabricating details. Although there are no classic signs of nervousness like fidgeting, blinking, or awkward pauses, the fact that their gaze shifts upward multiple times hints they might be constructing their story rather than recalling a genuine memory. It’s possible they’re just naturally calm or practiced at hiding deception, which means the absence of typical nervous signals isn’t definitive proof of truthfulness. The upward glances combined with their overall composed appearance make me lean slightly toward them not being entirely truthful, even if it’s not a certainty. Without more context, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance they could be lying, though it’s still somewhat ambiguous.

While I can't be completely sure, the signs are leaning somewhat toward the person being deceptive. One thing that stands out is how they frequently look down despite trying to maintain eye contact—this pattern of quickly dropping their gaze after a glance seems unusual. From what I've observed in other instances, people who lie often avoid steady eye contact, even if they attempt to appear sincere. Additionally, the raised eyebrows might suggest they're trying to convey surprise or innocence, but it could also be a nervous reaction.

That said, there are reasons to hesitate before jumping to conclusions. Their behavior could simply stem from anxiety or discomfort with being on camera, which might explain the shifting gaze and eyebrow movements. The fact that they don't smile or fidget much could mean they're consciously trying to stay composed rather than hiding something. If they were truthful, the downward looks might just reflect thoughtfulness or modesty, and the eyebrow raises a genuine response.

What nudges me toward thinking they might be deceptive is the inconsistency between their attempts to engage through eye contact and the avoidance shown by those downward glances—they seem caught between wanting to connect and wanting to disengage. Still, this isn't definitive. Without more context or hearing the full conversation, it's hard to say for sure. Overall, I lean slightly toward suspecting deception, but it's far from a certainty.

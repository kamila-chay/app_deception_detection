Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I’m not completely certain. They’re doing things like raising their eyebrows and tilting their head while maintaining steady eye contact, which can sometimes indicate someone is trying to appear thoughtful or engaged. The gaze upward might suggest they’re searching their memory, but it can also be a common tactic used by people who are fabricating a story. The subtle eyebrow raise feels a bit off—not quite surprise or a genuine reaction, but possibly nervousness or an attempt to influence the listener.

Interestingly, they’re not avoiding eye contact, which is often considered a sign of deception, but some skilled liars know to hold steady eye contact to seem more believable. The head tilt might be an effort to appear genuinely attentive, which could be part of a practiced performance. The absence of typical "tells" like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or stress signs is puzzling, but not all liars display these cues, and some people naturally show these behaviors even when honest.

Overall, while their calm and engaged demeanor might suggest truthfulness at first glance, the combination of the eyebrow raise, head tilt, upward gaze, and steady eye contact makes me lean toward thinking they might be crafting their story rather than fully honest. I wouldn’t say it’s certain, but I do suspect there’s some level of deception here.

Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the possibility that they might not be entirely truthful. While they maintain eye contact and keep their arms open—signs that typically suggest honesty—there are other subtle cues that raise some doubts. The frequent blinking seems excessive and could indicate stress or discomfort rather than just tiredness or lighting issues. Additionally, the way their chin lifts and appears tense feels like a controlled gesture, possibly hinting at some underlying tension or hesitation.

They don’t exhibit some classic deception signs such as avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, but their gaze shifts—looking down and sideways before meeting the other person’s eyes—introduce a bit of inconsistency that might be noteworthy. This combination of relaxed openness with these minor but potentially telling movements suggests they could be masking something.

While it’s not definitive, and some behaviors could have innocent explanations, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that they might be holding back or not fully truthful, rather than completely honest. Without additional context, it's hard to be certain, but the subtle cues collectively hint at possible deception.

This is a tricky one, but based on what I’m seeing, I’m leaning toward the idea that this person might not be entirely truthful. They maintain eye contact in a way that seems deliberate, but those repeated glances downward suggest a subtle avoidance, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or concealment. The raised eyebrows stand out as well—they come across as somewhat exaggerated, almost like an attempt to appear surprised or skeptical, but it doesn’t fully align with their words. This mismatch can be a sign of someone trying to mask their true feelings.

While it’s true that some people naturally raise their eyebrows when thinking or recalling information, the combination of these expressions alongside the occasional eye aversion feels more consistent with someone who is possibly fabricating or not being completely honest. The absence of overt nervous habits like fidgeting or face touching might indicate that they are consciously trying to control their body language, which can also be a tactic used when someone is unsure about being believed.

Of course, without knowing more about the context or the person’s typical behavior, it’s hard to be certain. But given the subtle cues—the deliberate gaze, the brief avoidance of eye contact, the raised eyebrows that don’t quite fit—the evidence leans more toward deception than full honesty. It’s not definitive, but I would be cautious about taking their words at face value.

Looking at the video, I'm leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though it's not entirely clear. Their nodding, while typically a sign of agreement, comes off as somewhat stiff, almost as if it’s forced. The raised eyebrows and frequent blinking stand out—these are often linked to nervousness, which can be a sign of deception. While nervousness could simply mean they’re anxious about being recorded or trying hard to get their story straight, the combination of these cues makes me suspicious. 

Their gaze shifting downward while still facing the person is curious—it doesn't fully fit the typical avoidance of eye contact seen in liars, but it might suggest they’re processing or constructing their response rather than being straightforward. The absence of classic tells like covering the mouth or fidgeting with hands, and their open arm posture, typically read as relaxed or honest, adds some ambiguity. Yet, this could also be a deliberate effort to appear open and truthful.

Overall, the mix of cues—the forced nodding, raised eyebrows, frequent blinking, and unusual eye movement—makes me lean slightly toward deception. It’s hard to be certain since some people do get tense or nervous under scrutiny even when telling the truth, but given what I’m seeing, I suspect they could be less than honest here. I wouldn’t call it definitive, but I do lean toward thinking they might be lying.

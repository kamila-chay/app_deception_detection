This is a tough call just from watching, but if I had to lean one way, I’d say the person is probably not being entirely truthful. They maintain consistent eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, but there are some subtle cues that make me suspicious. Notably, the fingers crossed under the table stand out—this gesture is often linked to deception, as if they’re secretly hoping the statement isn’t true. That alone raises a red flag.

Then there’s the exaggerated eye opening and the slight chin jut when they speak, which could indicate they’re trying hard to appear calm or sincere, possibly because they’re nervous. The raised eyebrows might just signal surprise or confusion, so that’s less clear, but combined with the other signs, it adds to the unease. On the other hand, the absence of more classic lying signals like fidgeting, awkward pauses, or fake facial expressions complicates things and leaves room for doubt.

Still, the crossed fingers and some of the tense facial expressions tip the scale slightly toward deception for me. It’s not a slam dunk—there’s definitely ambiguity here, and without more context or what they’re actually saying, I can’t be certain. But if I had to guess just based on the body language, I’d lean toward thinking they’re probably not telling the truth, even if that judgment is cautious.

Honestly, while there are no glaring signs of nervousness or typical “tells” of deception in the video—such as fidgeting, excessive blinking, or awkward pauses—the absence of these doesn’t necessarily guarantee honesty. The person's consistent eye contact and natural nodding might suggest engagement, but sometimes those behaviors can be deliberately controlled or rehearsed. The slight head turn, which could be a relaxed, attentive gesture, might also mask underlying discomfort or deceit, as people often use subtle body language to conceal their true feelings. Additionally, this clip is just a brief segment and might not reveal the full picture; they could have been less truthful at other points. Given these considerations, while it’s not certain, I lean toward the possibility that the person might be lying or at least not fully forthcoming.

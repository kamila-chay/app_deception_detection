Looking at this clip, I'm leaning toward the person probably not being entirely truthful, though I can't say that with complete certainty. They maintain consistent eye contact, which traditionally signals honesty, but I know that sometimes people who are lying will actually hold eye contact more intently to appear sincere. Their nodding seems natural, but it could also be a subtle attempt to seem cooperative and convincing. 

What really catches my attention is the repeated sideways glance—they look directly at the other person but then flick their eyes to the side briefly. This could be a nervous tic or a sign of thinking, but it might also be indicative of fabrication, as some research suggests that people glance away during moments of deception even if they maintain eye contact otherwise. The absence of typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting or excessive blinking could mean they're either very skilled at hiding discomfort or genuinely calm, but it also doesn't rule out the possibility of them controlling their mannerisms intentionally.

So, while their steady eye contact and composed demeanor initially suggest truthfulness, the subtle cues like the sideways glance and possibly too eager nodding make me suspicious. Without more context, it's difficult to be sure, but overall, I'm leaning somewhat toward the idea that they might be lying, though I’d want additional evidence to confirm that suspicion.

After watching the clip a few times, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be telling the truth. Their frequent blinking caught my attention—it seemed almost like they were trying to avoid looking at the camera. Their mouth was pulled down at the corners, and they kept sticking out their lips a bit, which felt unusual for someone who is supposed to be casual or relaxed. You’d expect a more neutral or friendly expression if they were being honest, but instead, they appeared tense. Additionally, they glanced down a lot while still attempting to maintain eye contact, and their head tilted as if they were processing something, but the motion seemed somewhat forced rather than a natural expression of curiosity.

Of course, there are reasons why they might behave this way without intending to deceive. They might just be nervous due to the situation, or the lip movement could simply be a habit or a sign of fatigue. The head tilting might reflect careful listening rather than dishonesty, and looking down can be a natural gesture when someone is thinking hard—not necessarily a sign of lying. I’ve done similar things myself when I’m trying to recall details.

Still, when putting all these signals together—the frequent blinking, the negative facial expressions, and the awkward efforts to maintain eye contact while looking away—it feels more like the pattern you’d expect from someone who isn’t being fully honest. I wouldn’t say this is definitive, since body language can be tricky to interpret, especially without more context. But based on what I observed, I’m inclined to suspect some level of deception, even though I’d want to know more before making a stronger judgment.

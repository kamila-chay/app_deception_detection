From what I observe in the video, the person maintains steady eye contact throughout, which is unusual for someone who might be lying. Typically, liars tend to avoid eye contact, fidget, or show nervous behaviors such as excessive blinking or shifting. However, their calmness and consistent gaze here seem almost too controlled, which can be a sign of practiced deception. This unnervingly relaxed demeanor might suggest they are consciously managing their behavior to avoid detection.

It’s possible they have rehearsed their story well, allowing them to appear smooth and confident even if they’re not being truthful. While the absence of common nervous cues like raised eyebrows, pauses, or lip movements might imply honesty, it could also indicate overcompensation—a deliberate effort to seem composed. The lack of any nervous habits could itself be a subtle red flag.

Although the steady eye contact and calmness could point towards truthfulness, these same cues might be employed by someone skilled at lying. Without knowing the context or content of what’s being said, it’s difficult to be sure, but based on these behaviors alone, I lean towards the possibility that the person might be deceiving, albeit not with any overt tells.

Watching this clip, I'm leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful, though I can't say for sure. Their steady eye contact and occasional upward glances could suggest honesty since many liars tend to avoid looking directly at others. However, the subtle head movement backward—like they're slightly leaning away—and the raised eyebrows strike me as potential signs of discomfort or an attempt to distance themselves physically from what they're saying. While the eyebrow raise isn't exaggerated, combined with the head pullback, it might indicate a guardedness that's often seen when someone is less than forthcoming.

Of course, it's also possible they’re just naturally expressive or feeling a bit tense, which could explain these cues without implying deception. They’re not showing classic nervous behaviors like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or awkward smiling, which makes it harder to be certain. Yet, those subtle physical distances and micro-expressions do incline me to suspect there might be some withholding of truth here, even if it’s not outright lying. Overall, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance they’re not telling the full story, but it’s not definitive, and a bit more information would be needed to be more confident.

After watching the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though I can’t be completely certain. While their solid eye contact and open arms usually suggest honesty, some other signals give me pause. The frequent eyebrow raising seems a bit exaggerated, almost as if they’re trying to appear more innocent or surprised than they really are. From what I’ve read, this kind of behavior can sometimes indicate nervousness linked to deception. Additionally, the head shaking doesn’t seem to align perfectly with what they’re saying, which could be a subtle sign of conflict in their communication. Although head shaking might just be a habit or emphasis, in this context it feels somewhat off. The mix of genuinely open gestures and these small inconsistencies makes me suspect they’re not being entirely truthful, even if I can’t say that with full confidence. Overall, I would say it’s more likely they’re hiding something, but more information would be needed to be sure.

This is a bit tricky to call just from the video, but leaning toward the idea that they might be lying seems reasonable. They maintain consistent eye contact and nod along while speaking, which often suggests engagement and truthfulness, yet those cues alone aren’t definitive. The side-to-side head shaking and shrugs stand out—these gestures could be attempts to deny or distance themselves from what’s being said, which is sometimes associated with deception. While open arms and the lack of fidgeting or facial touching typically signal honesty, these can also be consciously controlled by someone skilled at hiding lies. The head shaking might be more than a nervous tic; it could be a subtle sign of contradiction or discomfort masked as normal communication. Without hearing the actual content, it’s hard to be sure, but the combination of these mixed signals—especially the contradictory head shake and shrug alongside otherwise confident demeanor—leans me toward suspecting some level of deception, even if it’s not obvious or overt.

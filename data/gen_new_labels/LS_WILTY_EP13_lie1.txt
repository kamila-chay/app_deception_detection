This is a tough one, but leaning on the body language cues, I’d say the person is probably not telling the full truth. Their tight, downturned mouth and the subtle chin movements suggest some underlying discomfort, which could be a sign of withholding information. The repeated glances away from the person they’re speaking to, combined with the frequent head tilts and turns, might indicate avoidance or nervousness—behaviors often linked to deception. While they do maintain eye contact much of the time, which complicates the picture, the overall restlessness and lack of more obvious signs like fidgeting or excessive blinking might mean they’re trying to control their behavior to avoid giving themselves away. It's possible these gestures reflect stress or distraction unrelated to dishonesty, but given the mix of cues, I lean toward the interpretation that they might be hiding something, even if not outright lying. Context would definitely help clarify, but based on what’s observable, I’d tentatively say there’s a good chance this person isn’t being entirely truthful.

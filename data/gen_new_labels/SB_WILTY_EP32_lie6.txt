Looking at this clip, I'm inclined to think they might not be entirely truthful. They frequently looked down and sideways, avoiding direct eye contact in a way that often suggests discomfort or an attempt to conceal something. This kind of gaze behavior is commonly associated with nervousness or deception, especially when someone is trying to convince another person. The slight head tilt also seemed somewhat unnatural, as if they were trying too hard to appear engaged, which can sometimes hint at insincerity.

While they did keep their arms open, a gesture that usually signals openness, and maintained a calm demeanor without nervous laughter or forced smiles, these signs alone aren't enough to rule out deception. The lack of obvious nervous tells might just mean they're practiced at hiding their true feelings or simply uncomfortable in social situations. The sideways glances are particularly telling—why avoid direct eye contact if there’s nothing to hide? Altogether, the mix of cues makes me lean towards the possibility that they’re being less than truthful, though I wouldn’t say it’s certain. Without more context, I’m cautious but leaning toward the idea that they might be lying.

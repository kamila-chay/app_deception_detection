This is a tricky situation, but after looking closely at the clip, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though I can’t be certain. Their facial expressions are quite telling—there’s this unusual combination of frowning while raising their eyebrows, which seems like an attempt to appear surprised or skeptical, but the tension beneath suggests it’s not entirely genuine. The head shaking is particularly notable; it’s a strong, deliberate "no" gesture that doesn’t quite align with the rest of their body language. While their gaze is steady on the questioner, typically a sign of honesty, it’s contrasted sharply by the head shake and the contradiction with open palms, which usually indicate honesty. This mix of signals—the forced-looking expression, conflicting gestures, and the intense head shake—leans towards the possibility that they’re trying to mask the truth. Of course, it could just be nervousness or frustration, but overall, these signs push me slightly toward thinking they may be deceptive, even if I can’t fully rule out other explanations without more context.

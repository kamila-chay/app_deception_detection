Based on the video, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. The most noticeable thing is their constant downward gaze, which often raises suspicion since people who lie sometimes avoid eye contact. While it’s true some people naturally look down when thinking or trying to be polite, in this case it feels a bit off—almost like they’re deliberately avoiding direct engagement.

What makes it tricky is that they don’t show the typical nervous signs we often associate with deception, like fidgeting, blinking nervously, or awkward pauses. They remain calm and steady, which could either mean they’re telling the truth or that they’re simply very practiced at hiding any tells. The absence of these obvious cues might actually point to more calculated behavior, rather than genuine ease.

There’s also the possibility that their downcast eyes are a conscious effort to appear sincere or avoid suspicion. They could be uncomfortable, but it’s hard to be sure whether that discomfort stems from lying or just the situation itself. Without knowing the context or what they’re saying, it’s difficult to be definitive.

Taking everything into account, I find myself leaning slightly toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful. The downward gaze stands out as a subtle but potentially deliberate sign, and the overall lack of typical nervous behavior could suggest a controlled attempt to mask deception. Still, I wouldn’t be fully confident without more information, but I do suspect there’s a good chance they’re being less than honest.

This is a bit tricky, but leaning towards the idea that the person might be lying. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which is unusual since liars often avoid looking directly at the camera. However, this consistent gaze could be an attempt to overcompensate and appear honest, suggesting some level of deception. The tight, pinched frown around their eyes and mouth seems like a sign of stress or discomfort, which could indicate nervousness linked to dishonesty. While the lack of typical nervous behaviors—like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact—might suggest they’re telling the truth, it also could mean they’re practiced at concealing their unease. The calmness combined with the persistent frown feels somewhat off, as if they’re controlling their demeanor deliberately. Overall, while it’s not definitive, the cues point more towards them possibly being deceptive than fully honest.

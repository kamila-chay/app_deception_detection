Looking at the video, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely obvious. The repeated head tilting and raised eyebrows catch my attention—they could be signs of someone trying to appear more thoughtful or engaged than they really are, possibly to mask deception. While their open palms and relaxed arms typically suggest honesty, it’s also possible that these gestures are deliberately used to create a sense of openness and trustworthiness. Their mostly steady eye contact might be an attempt to appear genuine, yet the moments when they look down could indicate uncertainty or discomfort linked to fabricating a story. The absence of obvious nervous gestures like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact complicates the picture, but I wonder if that calmness is more controlled than natural. Overall, while the cues don’t conclusively prove they’re lying, the combination of subtle behaviors makes me lean toward deception as a plausible explanation.

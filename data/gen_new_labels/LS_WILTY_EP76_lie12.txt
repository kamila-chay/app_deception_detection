Hmm, this is a bit tricky, but leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying does seem reasonable. While they do maintain some direct eye contact, which typically suggests honesty, that repeated sideways glance they keep throwing in is a bit suspicious. People often look away or shift their gaze when they're trying to hide something or feeling deceptive, so that behavior raises some doubts. The slight, half-hearted smile—really more of a forced lip lift than a genuine smile—also feels like it could be an attempt to mask discomfort, which sometimes happens when someone isn’t being fully truthful. They don’t show obvious signs like nervous fidgeting or exaggerated surprise, but the subtle cues here add up to a possibility of deception. I can’t say with certainty that they’re lying, since these behaviors might also indicate nervousness or distraction, but on balance, I tend to lean toward suspecting that they’re not being completely honest.

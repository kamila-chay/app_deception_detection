Honestly, I'm leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I'm not completely certain. The most striking thing is how often they look down, avoiding eye contact, which is often associated with hiding something. While it’s true they don’t show other typical signs of nervousness—like fidgeting, sweating, or unusual pauses—the absence of those cues isn’t necessarily proof of honesty. Some people can be quite skilled at controlling their behavior when they’re being deceptive, presenting a calm exterior to mask what they’re really feeling.

I recognize that people might look down for reasons other than lying, such as shyness, thoughtfulness, or discomfort in front of a camera, and that can complicate things. However, the consistent downward gaze does raise some suspicion. Usually, when someone is telling the truth, they tend to engage more openly, even if they’re admitting something difficult. Here, the person seems unusually still and reserved, which could be a sign of withholding or crafting their story.

So, while I wouldn’t say it’s a certainty that they’re being deceptive, the cues do make me lean more toward that possibility. The behavior doesn’t quite convince me they’re fully truthful, and it feels like there’s something off beneath the surface—even if it’s subtle. I’d say it’s more likely they’re not being entirely honest, though I can’t say that with complete confidence.

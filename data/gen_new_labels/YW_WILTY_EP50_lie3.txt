This is a bit puzzling. Watching the clip, there are signs that initially suggest honesty—they maintain eye contact most of the time, which is often associated with truthfulness, and they smile in a natural way without appearing tense or nervous. There’s no obvious fidgeting, excessive blinking, or avoidance of eye contact, which are classic red flags for deception.

However, some of these cues might not tell the whole story. The smile, while seemingly genuine, could also be a subtle attempt to appear calm and friendly, potentially masking discomfort. The sideways glance might be more than just a natural habit—it could indicate that they are thinking carefully about their responses, possibly trying to manage what they say. It’s worth considering that some people are skilled at hiding typical signs of lying, maintaining eye contact and seeming relaxed to avoid suspicion.

The absence of clear nervous behavior doesn’t necessarily guarantee truthfulness—it might be the behavior of someone practiced in deception. While their engagement and smile lean toward honesty, the context and subtle nuances leave room for doubt. Overall, based on these observations, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they might not be entirely truthful, though it’s hard to be definitive without more information.

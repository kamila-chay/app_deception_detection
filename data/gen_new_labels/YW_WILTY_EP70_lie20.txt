Watching the clip, it’s a bit challenging to be certain, but I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive. They appear calm and engaged, maintaining consistent eye contact and nodding along, which at first glance feels natural. However, I’m aware that some liars deliberately keep strong eye contact to appear credible, so this behavior might be a tactic rather than a sign of honesty. The occasional upward gaze could suggest they’re constructing a story rather than recalling a genuine memory, as some studies mention this as a potential indicator of fabrication, though it’s not definitive. 

While they lack obvious nervous habits like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, it’s worth considering that certain skilled deceivers can mask these signs well. The absence of classic telltale signs such as forced smiles or awkward pauses doesn’t necessarily guarantee truthfulness. Given that people vary so much in their responses, and some skilled liars can present as relaxed and confident, I’m inclined to suspect there might be some level of deception here, though I wouldn’t be absolutely sure. It seems more plausible they’re not fully truthful, but I’d need more context to be confident.

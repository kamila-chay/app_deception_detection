Watching this clip, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, although it's not entirely clear. What really caught my attention is how frequently they’re blinking—significantly more than usual while responding. Since frequent blinking is sometimes linked to stress or nervousness, which can be associated with deception, this raises some suspicion. While it's true they maintain eye contact, don’t fidget, and have neutral facial expressions, these neutral signs don’t completely outweigh the unusual blinking.

It’s possible that the blinking could be a natural reaction to pressure or an attempt to control other cues, especially if they’re trying hard to keep their face calm. Maybe it’s unrelated to lying—like fatigue or eye irritation—but it still feels like a subtle clue that something might be off. Their steady speech without awkward pauses or stammering is a point in favor of honesty, but some people can lie convincingly without obvious signs, making me wary.

Given all this, the blinking stands out more than other behaviors, which seem fairly neutral. I can’t say for certain they’re lying, but the blinking makes me lean toward deception, even if just slightly. Without more context—it’s tough to be sure—but overall, I find myself doubtful about their truthfulness.

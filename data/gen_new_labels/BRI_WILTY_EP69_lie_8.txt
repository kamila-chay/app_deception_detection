Upon watching the clip, several behavioral cues suggest the person might not be entirely truthful. Their blinking rate is noticeably high, which can be a sign of discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct engagement. The consistently raised eyebrows come across as an unnatural display of surprise or skepticism, rather than a genuine reaction. Furthermore, the sideways glances instead of direct eye contact often indicate someone is trying to carefully construct their response rather than recalling a straightforward memory.

Granted, these signs aren't conclusive on their own. Fatigue or dry eyes could explain the excessive blinking, and raised eyebrows might simply reflect surprise at the question. Some people naturally look away when thinking, and subtle head movements can be a sign of nervousness rather than deception. However, when taken together—the frequent blinking, the eyebrow movements, and the avoidance of eye contact—they create a pattern that leans toward someone being less than forthcoming. While it's possible they're just uncomfortable or flustered by the situation, the combination of these behaviors makes me inclined to suspect they're probably not telling the whole truth. Still, without additional context or information, it's difficult to say definitively, but the overall impression tilts toward deception rather than honesty.

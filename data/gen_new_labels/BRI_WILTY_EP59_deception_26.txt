This is a bit challenging to interpret, but overall, I find myself leaning slightly toward thinking the person might be lying. They maintain steady eye contact, which typically suggests honesty since people often look away when hiding something. They also glance upward occasionally, a behavior associated with recalling genuine memories rather than fabricating stories. At first glance, these signs might indicate truthfulness.

However, there are reasons to be cautious about taking these cues at face value. Some individuals who are practiced liars deliberately maintain strong eye contact to appear trustworthy, so the steady gaze might be a calculated effort rather than a natural response. Additionally, their calmness and lack of nervous habits—such as fidgeting, excessive blinking, or face touching—could be a form of overcompensation. Often, people who lie display signs of stress, but here the composure almost feels too perfect, which raises some suspicion.

The upward gaze is interesting, as it could indicate genuine memory recall. Yet, without knowing the context—whether the question was simple or required detailed recollection—it’s hard to be sure. Some people habitually look up when talking, regardless of truthfulness, so this gesture alone is inconclusive.

While the absence of classic signs of deception stands out and might suggest honesty, I’m inclined to think that this person could be deliberately managing their behavior to appear credible. It’s not certain, but given the combination of cues, I lean toward the possibility that they might be lying, or at least not fully truthful.

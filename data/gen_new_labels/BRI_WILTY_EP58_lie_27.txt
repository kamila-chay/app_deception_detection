I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're lying, but it's tricky without context—I'm relying solely on their behavior. One thing that catches my attention is their slight frown—not a full scowl, but their eyebrows are pulled down a bit. Frowning can sometimes indicate stress, which might suggest deception, though it can also happen when someone is concentrating or trying to recall information. So, it’s not definitive on its own.

Their eye contact seems steady; they’re not avoiding it, and they glance up and down while thinking, which appears normal. They don’t show common signs of nervousness like fidgeting or touching their face, and they seem calm overall. This would usually point toward honesty.

However, that persistent frown keeps making me question things. It could signify stress related to lying, or it might simply reflect frustration or seriousness about the topic. The lack of other clear deceptive cues makes it hard to be certain, but taken with the frown, it leans me slightly toward thinking they might be concealing something. While I’m not fully convinced, and more context would help, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they could be lying.

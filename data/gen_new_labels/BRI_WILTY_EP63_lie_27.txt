I'm not entirely certain, but based on the video, I tend to think the person might be leaning toward deception. The most notable detail is that they're crossing their fingers behind their back with both hands, which often appears in situations where someone might be trying to conceal the truth or hoping to "cancel out" a lie. This gesture strikes me as a nervous habit that could be an attempt to mask something, especially since other typical signs of lying, like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, aren’t present.

That said, I do acknowledge that finger-crossing could simply be a harmless or habitual gesture for them—maybe something they do when concentrating or out of habit, unrelated to deception. They don’t display heightened anxiety or other stress indicators one might expect if they were lying. Their calm demeanor elsewhere gives me pause, suggesting the finger-crossing might not be definitive proof of dishonesty but rather a coincidental or unrelated behavior.

Still, given that crossing fingers is commonly linked to insincerity or hoping for luck in deceptive situations, I lean toward the idea that they could be concealing something, even though the lack of additional signs makes it far from certain. Without more context or verbal cues, my impression is that there’s a reasonable chance they’re being deceptive, but it’s not conclusive. Overall, I’m inclined to suspect some degree of dishonesty, but I wouldn’t rule out other explanations without further evidence.

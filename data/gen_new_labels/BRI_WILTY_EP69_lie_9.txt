Honestly, while there are no glaring signs of deception, I tend to lean slightly toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. The repeated sideways glances instead of direct eye contact can sometimes suggest evasiveness, even though it might also be due to shyness or distraction. The eyebrow raises might indicate they’re processing the question, but could also be a subtle sign of discomfort linked to fabricating or modifying their response. Their head moving backward could reflect unease rather than relaxation. The absence of more overt nervous behaviors like fidgeting or excessive blinking isn’t conclusive, but it doesn’t necessarily rule out deception either—some people can maintain a relatively calm exterior while being untruthful. The lack of genuine smiling or laughter when recounting a story that feels like it might require more emotional engagement also raises a slight suspicion. Given these mixed signals, I can’t say with certainty they are lying, but I do lean towards the possibility that they might not be fully truthful. More context would definitely help clarify the situation, but right now, I’m inclined to suspect some level of deception.

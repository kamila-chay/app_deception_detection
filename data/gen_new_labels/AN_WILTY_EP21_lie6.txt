Looking at the clip, I'm leaning toward the possibility that this person might not be fully truthful, though I can't say for certain. While they maintain steady eye contact and keep their palms facing up—both cues that typically suggest openness and honesty—these signs can sometimes be deliberately controlled by someone trying to appear sincere. The raised eyebrows could be a natural reaction, but they might also indicate nervousness or an attempt to feign surprise. Interestingly, the absence of obvious stress signals like fidgeting or tension doesn't necessarily mean they're honest; it could mean they're skilled at masking discomfort or confident in their deception. Given these mixed signals and without knowing the full context, I find myself inclined to suspect they might be lying, even if the evidence isn't conclusive.

It's difficult to be certain just from watching, but after reviewing the clip, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that the person might be deceiving. While they do maintain eye contact and nod along as if actively listening, which usually suggests engagement, these behaviors can also be consciously controlled to appear sincere. The smile, though it appears natural, could very well be an attempt to seem friendly or convincing—people sometimes smile more when lying to cover up discomfort.

The head tilt might indicate processing or thinking hard, but it could also be a subtle strategy to buy time while fabricating a response. Although there are no classic signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the absence of these cues doesn’t guarantee honesty, as some individuals are adept at controlling their body language when lying. Without knowing the context of the conversation, it's hard to be definitive, but the overall cues suggest a slight inclination toward deception rather than truthfulness.

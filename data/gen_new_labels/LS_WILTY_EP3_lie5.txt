After watching the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, although I can’t say for sure. Their facial expression is unusual—there’s a tension where their eyebrows seem both frowning and raised, which suggests some kind of internal struggle or discomfort. Their mouth stays tightly closed during pauses, which feels less like nervousness and more like holding something back. The way they avoid direct eye contact by looking down and frequently turning their head sideways gives an impression of unease or an attempt to distance themselves from the conversation. While all these behaviors could be explained by stress or unfamiliarity with being filmed, the combination of signs—especially the awkward silences with pursed lips and conflicting facial cues—makes me lean toward thinking they might be concealing the truth. It’s not definitive, and without hearing more or knowing the context, I can’t be certain, but the evidence slightly tips in favor of deception.

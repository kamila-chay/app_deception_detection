Based on what I’m seeing in the video, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though I can’t say that with absolute certainty. They appear quite fidgety—their blinking is excessive, almost as if they’re avoiding eye contact with the camera. Their raised eyebrows, which could signal surprise or confusion, might instead be a sign of nervousness about their answers. Their mouth movement is awkward too: they open it wide, then snap it shut as if struggling to articulate their thoughts, while their lips tense up oddly. Their head tilts and shakes intermittently, and their eyes mostly look down rather than engaging with the camera, which often suggests discomfort or deception.

That said, I’m somewhat hesitant because these signs might also stem from stress, tiredness, or simply unfamiliarity with being on camera. Raised eyebrows could genuinely mean they were taken off guard, not necessarily that they’re hiding something. The head movements might be in response to a different point, not signaling dishonesty. Pauses and awkward mouth movements can also happen when someone is carefully recalling information truthfully.

Overall, the behavioral cues point somewhat toward deception, particularly the downward gaze and fidgeting, but none of these signals on their own are definitive. Without more context, I lean toward believing there’s some degree of deceit, but I wouldn’t assert it confidently. It remains quite possible they’re just uncomfortable or stressed, making it tricky to be certain based only on these body language cues.

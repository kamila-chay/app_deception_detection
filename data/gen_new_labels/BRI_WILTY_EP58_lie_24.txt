Watching the clip, the person seems calm at first glance—there’s no obvious avoidance of eye contact or noticeable fidgeting, which might suggest honesty. They look directly at the person they're speaking to most of the time, a behavior often associated with truthfulness. However, the unusual chin movements—subtle nodding or jaw tension—feel somewhat off, as if they're trying to consciously maintain a calm appearance. The frequent sideways glances don’t align with the classic avoidance of gaze typically seen in deception; instead, they give the impression of distraction or internal calculation, perhaps as if rehearsing what to say.  

It’s possible that these cues are just natural habits—maybe the person moves their chin when concentrating and glances sideways when thinking. Raised eyebrows could simply indicate surprise rather than nervousness, which is common for someone caught off-guard but telling the truth.  

What complicates the picture is the absence of more clear-cut signs of lying. There’s no fidgeting, forced smiling, or rapid blinking, which are often associated with deception. However, the lack of these classic signs might not reliably indicate honesty—some individuals can be quite adept at concealing their deceit. Given the subtle but somewhat unnatural behaviors like the chin movement and distracted glances, I’d lean slightly toward suspicion that the person might not be fully truthful. This is far from certain, though; without knowing more about the context and what exactly is being said, it’s difficult to be confident. Overall, while the cues aren’t definitive, there is a tentative impression that deception could be at play.

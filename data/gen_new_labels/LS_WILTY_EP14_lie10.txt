After watching the clip a few times, I find it somewhat difficult to be certain, but I tend to lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. Their scowling expression is unusual—it’s not the typical attempt to soften or mask emotions that people often use when lying, but it could be a sign of frustration or discomfort that might accompany dishonesty. The exaggerated eye closing feels off, almost like they’re trying hard to shut out the question, which could be a subconscious reaction to stress or an indication of them hiding something.

Their head movements—leaning forward and tilting—might suggest engagement, but the repeated sideways glances could be more telling. While such glances can mean uncertainty, they often appear when someone is fabricating or being evasive. The open arms seem to contradict deception, as crossed arms or fidgeting are common defensive behaviors, yet openness can sometimes be a calculated way to appear honest.

Putting these cues together, the scowl and eye closing might be nervous habits linked to lying rather than genuine frustration. It’s also possible that their open body posture is an intentional attempt to appear trustworthy, which doesn’t fully convince me. So, although it’s not definitive, the signals do incline me toward thinking they might be hiding something. Without more context, I can't say for sure, but overall, I lean toward the possibility that the person is not entirely truthful.

While there are some signals that typically suggest truthfulness, such as sustained eye contact and consistent nodding, the repeated raising of their eyebrows stands out as somewhat unusual and potentially indicative of discomfort or a subtle attempt to appear convincing. People who are genuinely honest tend to keep their eyebrows relatively neutral unless they are reacting naturally to something, so this gesture feels at odds with the otherwise steady demeanor. Although the lack of classic signs of deception—like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or awkward pauses—might suggest calmness, it could also be someone consciously or unconsciously overcompensating to seem credible. The eyebrow movement might be a nervous tic or a deliberate cue aimed at enhancing their trustworthiness. Given these mixed signals, I am somewhat inclined to suspect that the person might not be entirely truthful, though it’s far from definitive. Without more context or additional cues, it’s difficult to be certain, but the eyebrow behavior nudges me toward leaning slightly toward deception.

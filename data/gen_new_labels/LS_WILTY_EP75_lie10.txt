Looking at this clip, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. They maintain very steady eye contact, which at first glance seems like a sign of honesty, but sometimes people who lie do this deliberately to appear truthful—almost like they’re trying too hard to convince. The eyebrow raises also stand out; they don’t come across as natural expressions of surprise or engagement but could be interpreted as nervous or forced, as if they’re bracing for skepticism or trying to emphasize their point. The absence of more genuine emotional cues like natural smiles or frowns adds to the impression that their behavior is somewhat rehearsed or controlled.

On the other hand, there are reasons to hesitate before concluding they’re lying. Some individuals naturally gesture with their eyebrows when focused or engaged, and the lack of other typical signs of deception—like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or hiding their face—does suggest a level of composure more consistent with truth-telling. Still, the combination of intense eye contact paired with those eyebrow movements feels a bit off and raises some suspicion. It’s not definitive evidence of lying, but overall, the subtle cues point slightly more toward them potentially being deceptive than not. Without additional context or seeing how they respond to tougher questions, it’s hard to say for sure, but I would lean cautiously in the direction of suspected deception.

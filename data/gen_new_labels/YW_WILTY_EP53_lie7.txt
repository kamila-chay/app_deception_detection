Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward thinking the person might be lying, though it’s not totally certain. They maintain direct eye contact, which often suggests honesty since liars tend to avoid it, but that alone isn’t definitive. The frequent eyebrow raising stands out—it feels like they’re trying to appear surprised or defensive, which could be a subtle sign of discomfort or someone selling a story. This kind of gesture can sometimes indicate nervousness or overcompensation, even if it’s not exaggerated.

Their open palms usually signal sincerity, but that’s not a guarantee—they might be deliberately using that to appear truthful. The lack of typical nervous habits like fidgeting, smiling, or laughing could mean they’re very practiced at hiding deception. It’s also possible they’re controlling their behavior perfectly to seem convincing.

While the eye contact and open palms initially suggest honesty, the eyebrow movements and overall tension make me inclined to suspect some level of deception. Without more context or knowledge of their usual behavior, it’s tough to be sure, but the subtle cues point more toward them not being entirely truthful.

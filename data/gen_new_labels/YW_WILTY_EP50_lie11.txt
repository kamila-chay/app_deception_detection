Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. Their frequent blinking stands out—it’s unusually rapid and often linked to stress or deception. Alongside that, the slight, almost forced smile with lips pulled up at the corners feels somewhat off, as if it doesn’t quite align with the rest of their expression. These signs suggest some level of discomfort or possibly an attempt to mask the truth. Additionally, their nodding while speaking could be a natural habit, but it can also be a subtle way to appear more convincing, which raises some suspicion.

On the other hand, they do have open palms visible and maintain steady eye contact, which are generally associated with honesty. Usually, if someone were lying, you might expect them to avert their gaze or show more fidgety behavior, but here they don’t. This complicates the picture and gives a somewhat contradictory impression. It’s possible that the blinking and weird lip movements are just nervous reactions rather than intentional deceit, but combined, these cues make me suspicious.

Overall, while the open palms and direct gaze temper my certainty, the other behaviors make me lean toward thinking there’s some level of deception going on. I wouldn’t say it’s definitive, but given the signs—especially the blinking and subtle smile—it feels more likely they’re not being entirely truthful. It’s one of those cases where I’d cautiously suspect lying, even if I can’t be completely sure.

Looking at this clip, there are some cues that make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive, though I wouldn’t say that with full confidence. On one hand, they seem calm and engaged, maintaining consistent eye contact and keeping their arms open, which usually suggests openness rather than defensiveness. Their lack of fidgeting or obvious stress signs like excessive blinking or awkward pauses also doesn’t strongly point to lying.

However, that brief eyebrow raise stands out—it’s subtle and not repeated, but raised eyebrows can sometimes indicate someone is trying to appear innocent or surprised in a way that’s not entirely genuine. While this could be just a natural reaction or a nervous tic, it does introduce some doubt. Plus, although head tilting typically signals curiosity or listening, it’s worth remembering that people can fake these so-called “honest” gestures to mask dishonesty.

The overall ease in their behavior could be a sign of confidence or practiced composure, which sometimes happens when someone is lying but trying hard not to be caught. The absence of classic signs like darting eyes or lip biting doesn’t fully exclude deception, as not everyone exhibits these. Given these mixed signals, I’m inclined to think there’s a decent chance they might not be telling the whole truth, though it’s far from certain. Without more context or additional footage, I’d cautiously lean toward deception but remain quite open to other explanations.

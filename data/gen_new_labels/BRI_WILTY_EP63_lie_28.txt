Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I’m not entirely certain. The smile they have throughout seems relaxed, which initially suggests it could be genuine, since forced smiles often accompany deception. However, their arms are crossed the whole time, which strikes me as a somewhat defensive posture, often linked to discomfort or hiding something. 

On top of that, the fact that they avoid eye contact entirely is a bit more concerning. While some people naturally avoid eye contact due to shyness or discomfort, in combination with the crossed arms, it feels more like a sign of evasion rather than just being uncomfortable. The smile, while relaxed, almost seems disconnected from the rest of their body language, which raises some doubts about its authenticity.

Taken together, the avoidance of eye contact and defensive posture give me a stronger impression of possible deception than the smile does of truthfulness. That said, I recognize there could be other explanations, like the person simply being closed-off or awkward in the situation. Overall, though, I’d lean toward thinking they’re probably not being fully honest, even if I’m not ready to say that with full confidence. More context would definitely help, but for now, the balance of cues suggests some degree of deception.

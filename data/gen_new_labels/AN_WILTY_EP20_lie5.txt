Honestly, while I'm not completely certain, the way they keep looking down makes me lean somewhat toward them possibly being deceptive. Although it's not a definitive sign on its own, avoiding eye contact is commonly cited as a potential indicator of lying, which raises some suspicion. At the same time, their calm demeanor—no fidgeting, pauses, or nervous habits—could suggest otherwise, since lying often brings about more obvious signs of discomfort or overcompensation. 

Still, it does make me wonder if their calmness might be a deliberate attempt to mask any deceit. It’s possible they’re skilled at hiding nervousness, so the lack of typical tells doesn’t rule out deception. Plus, without knowing the context, maybe the topic itself is making them uneasy, which could cause that downward gaze regardless of truthfulness. 

Taking all of this into account, I don’t think it’s clear-cut, but overall, I tend to lean slightly toward the idea that they might be hiding something. The cues suggest deception more than truth to me, though it's definitely not certain—there’s still room for doubt.

This is a bit challenging to discern from behavior alone, but leaning slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive seems reasonable. They maintain steady eye contact, which might suggest sincerity at first glance, but some individuals do this intentionally when lying to appear honest. The occasional eyebrow raises could indicate genuine surprise or thoughtfulness, yet they might also be subtle signs of discomfort or cognitive load associated with fabricating information. The absence of classic nervous behaviors like fidgeting or gaze aversion doesn't necessarily rule out deception; some skilled liars remain composed and controlled. While these cues don't provide definitive proof, the combination of steady eye contact used strategically and those eyebrow movements makes me somewhat inclined to suspect they might not be entirely truthful. More context or consistency checks would be needed to be confident, but based on the visible behavior, deception seems slightly more likely.

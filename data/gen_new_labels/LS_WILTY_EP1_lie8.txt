Based on what I'm seeing in the clip, I lean toward thinking the person might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. The smile they have seems a bit tight and possibly too controlled—it doesn't fully reach their eyes, which can sometimes indicate they're trying to mask their true feelings. Their frequent eyebrow raises and head tilting could be natural gestures, but taken together with the stiff smile, these might suggest they're putting on a front. 

The way they touch their head a few times, both while talking and pausing, is a common nervous gesture that some interpret as a sign of deception. Their side glances, while possibly just thinking cues, can also be read as avoidance of direct eye contact. While the lack of more overt stress signals—like rapid blinking or covering their mouth—suggests some calmness, that calmness could reflect confidence in maintaining a lie rather than truthfulness.

Overall, the behaviors blend signals of engagement and nervousness in a way that doesn't clearly point to honesty. I wouldn't say I'm certain they're being deceptive, but there is enough here to suspect they might not be fully truthful. Without more context or information about what they’re saying, it’s hard to be sure, but I do lean toward the possibility that they are not entirely honest.

Honestly, I'm not completely sure, but after considering what I'm noticing, I tend to lean toward the possibility that the person might be lying. The way they keep looking upward—staring at the ceiling or off to the side—could be a sign of trying to construct a story rather than recalling a genuine memory. While people do often look up when trying to remember something, this same behavior is sometimes associated with fabricating information.  

What’s a bit puzzling is how calm and composed they seem—no fidgeting, no nervous habits like avoiding eye contact or touching their face. You might think lying would bring out some tension, but sometimes people who lie can appear too calm, perhaps because they’re trying hard to seem credible or have practiced their act. That focus could be genuine, but it could also be rehearsed.  

On the other hand, it’s also possible that the upward gaze is just a natural habit when thinking, unrelated to deception. I've seen that often in honest people, so it’s hard to be sure.  

Overall, while the calmness pulls me slightly in the direction of truthfulness, the subtle cues, especially the upward gaze, make me lean a bit toward deception. It’s definitely not clear-cut, though, and without more context or the rest of the conversation, I’d hesitate to make a firm judgment. Still, if I had to guess, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance they could be lying.

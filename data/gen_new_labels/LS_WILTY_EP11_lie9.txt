As I watch this clip, I'm getting the sense that the person might not be entirely truthful. They do maintain fairly consistent eye contact, which can usually suggest honesty, but the repeated sideways glances stand out—they're not just brief looks away, but noticeable shifts in gaze that could be indicative of deception. While it's true some people naturally glance sideways when thinking, this behavior has often been linked to trying to avoid full transparency. The calm demeanor is interesting too; sometimes people who are lying try to appear overly composed to cover their nervousness, and although this doesn't come across as forced, it does feel a little too smooth.

There aren’t other strong signs like fidgeting or awkward pauses, which complicates things, but the sideways glances combined with this overly calm presentation make me lean toward the idea that they might be hiding something. It’s not a clear-cut case, and I can’t be certain without more context or hearing their exact words, but the subtle cues here tip me slightly towards thinking they could be deceptive. It’s definitely a bit of a gray area, but right now, I’m inclined to suspect they might not be telling the whole truth.

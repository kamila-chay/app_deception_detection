This situation is actually quite ambiguous, but leaning towards the possibility that the person might be deceiving. While they maintain steady eye contact and nod along—which typically suggest engagement and sincerity—there are subtle cues that raise some doubts. The repeated scratching, especially around the neck or face, can often signal nervousness or an attempt to self-soothe, which might indicate discomfort with the truth. The consistent but mild raising of the eyebrows could also hint at unease or processing something uncertain, rather than just natural expressiveness.

Although there are no overt signs commonly associated with lying—no awkward pauses, no avoidance of gaze, no excessive blinking—the absence of these doesn’t necessarily guarantee honesty. The calm demeanor might be a mask, a quiet attempt to conceal dishonesty rather than openness. The subtle lip lift could be a genuine reaction, yet in this context, it might also serve as a polite or rehearsed gesture.

Given these mixed signals, I incline somewhat toward thinking they might be withholding information or not being entirely truthful, even if it’s far from conclusive. The behavior doesn’t definitively expose deception, but the nervous habits combined with otherwise smooth interaction make me lean more toward suspicion than full belief. Without more context or additional cues, it’s hard to be certain, but the signs tilt slightly in the direction of potential lying.

This is a bit difficult to determine just from watching, but I’m inclined to think the person might be leaning toward deception. Their body language strikes me as somewhat off—they frequently look down, avoiding direct eye contact even though they are facing the other person. Their eyes seem focused on the ground or their hands instead of meeting the gaze directly. Plus, there’s something about how they pull their lips back inward, almost like they’re trying to keep their mouth tightly closed or suppress a grimace. It doesn’t come across as a natural expression—more like a tense, closed-off mouth. They’re nodding along as if agreeing, but the nods feel stiff, almost forced.

I can’t rule out the possibility that they’re just nervous or shy—plenty of people avoid eye contact and look down when they’re uncomfortable or deep in thought, especially when being questioned. That lip behavior might be a habitual expression when concentrating, unrelated to deceit. So, it’s not entirely clear-cut.

However, the combination of their reluctance to maintain eye contact, coupled with a somewhat forced nodding and that particular lip tension, aligns with subtle cues often observed in deceptive behavior—like the body trying to appear engaged while signaling discomfort. I’m not fully certain, and it might just be my interpretation, but these signs do suggest they could be withholding something or not fully truthful.

All things considered, I lean toward thinking they might be lying, though it’s far from definitive. It strikes me as suspicious, but without additional context or hearing what they’re saying, it’s hard to say for sure. At this point, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance of deception, but it’s not entirely solid evidence.

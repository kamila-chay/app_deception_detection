Watching this clip, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. They appear relaxed at first, with a smile and raised eyebrows that seem like signs of genuine engagement. However, the smile strikes me as a bit forced, almost as if they’re trying to appear friendly to mask something. It reminds me of how people sometimes smile to appear calm when they’re actually nervous or hiding something. The raised eyebrows come off as rehearsed, like they’re attempting to seem surprised or innocent on purpose. Their head movements—pulling back slightly and tilting to the side—feel unnatural, more like creating distance from their words than a casual gesture.

That said, there are some conflicting signals. They maintain steady eye contact and don’t show obvious nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, which are classic indicators of deception. The head tilt could just be them paying close attention rather than trying to conceal anything. Because of these mixed cues, I can’t say for certain that they’re lying, but overall, the signs point more towards them possibly being deceptive than not. It seems like they might be trying hard to appear genuine, which ironically raises my suspicion rather than easing it.

While I'm not completely certain, there are a few details that make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. They maintained eye contact throughout, which usually suggests honesty, since avoiding gaze is often linked to lying. However, the almost constant blinking stood out to me—it could signal nervousness, but it also might indicate discomfort or stress associated with deception. The conflicting head movements, with nodding and shaking occurring together, seemed inconsistent and possibly a sign of someone struggling to keep their story straight.  

At the same time, their open arm posture and lack of defensive gestures typically suggest comfort and sincerity, which complicates the picture. Still, the absence of natural emotional expressions, like smiles or frowns, felt a bit stiff and could imply they were deliberately controlling their reactions. This kind of emotional flatness sometimes points to concealment or fabrication.  

Taking everything into account, the blinking and contradictory head signals make me slightly suspicious, even if the open body language and steady eye contact pull in the opposite direction. Overall, I lean toward the possibility that they might be lying, though I wouldn’t say this with full confidence. More context about the conversation would definitely help clarify their truthfulness.

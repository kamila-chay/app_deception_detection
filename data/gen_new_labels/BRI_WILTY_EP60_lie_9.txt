Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m starting to lean toward the person probably being deceptive, though it’s not entirely clear. The fact that they maintain steady eye contact throughout is unusual—people often say liars avoid eye contact, but this could actually be a deliberate tactic to seem sincere and disarm suspicion. That level of focused gaze feels a bit calculated rather than natural. Meanwhile, the constant hand rubbing seems like more than just nervousness; it could be a sign of discomfort related to dishonesty, like they’re trying to self-soothe while keeping their composure. 

What’s interesting is that while they don’t show other classic signs of lying such as fidgeting with their face or awkward pauses, their overall stillness might be a form of control or rehearsed behavior, designed to hide true feelings. It doesn’t quite fit the typical picture of someone who is genuinely relaxed or truthful. Although hand rubbing alone isn’t definitive proof, combined with the intense eye contact and controlled demeanor, it suggests that they might be putting in extra effort to manage their appearance and mask the truth. 

So, while it’s still possible they’re just nervous or naturally fidgety, the cues do incline me toward thinking they are more likely to be lying or at least not fully honest. I wouldn't say it’s certain, but the balance of behaviors makes me lean in that direction rather than the other way around.

After watching the clip a few times, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t say for certain. They blinked a lot—far more than usual—which can sometimes indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid eye contact. Their lips were pushed out in a subtle pout or frown, a gesture I’ve noticed before when someone is trying to conceal something or feeling stressed. They frequently glanced sideways instead of looking directly at the person they were talking to, which can suggest evasion. The nodding seemed somewhat stiff and forced rather than natural, and though head tilting can be a sign of engagement, combined with the other cues, it feels a bit off.

That said, I recognize these behaviors might have other explanations. Excessive blinking could be due to tiredness or dry eyes, the sideways glances might simply be a way to think, and the lip movement could reflect frustration rather than deception. Head tilting and nodding might just be normal listening habits. However, when these signals appear together, especially the blinking, lip pursing, and avoidance of direct eye contact, it raises suspicion for me. Without knowing the full context or what exactly they were discussing, it’s hard to be definitive, but I find myself leaning toward the notion that they might not be telling the whole truth. It’s not a strong conclusion, but the signs point more in that direction than away from it.

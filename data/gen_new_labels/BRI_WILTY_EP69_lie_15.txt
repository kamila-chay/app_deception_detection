This situation is somewhat puzzling. The person in the clip nods while talking, which feels a bit off—almost like they're trying to convince themselves or appear engaged, but it doesn’t come across as entirely natural. Their gaze mostly shifts sideways instead of meeting the other person's eyes, which can sometimes indicate an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, a common sign of discomfort that might suggest they’re not being fully truthful. They also raise their eyebrows occasionally, which could simply signal surprise or emphasis, but can also be a subtle indicator of stress. On the other hand, their palms are facing up—a gesture often associated with openness and honesty—and they show no signs of fidgeting, nervous laughter, or awkward pauses that typically accompany deceit. Still, that sideways glance is a bit of a red flag; most people tend to look more directly at someone when they’re relaxed and truthful, so this avoidance of eye contact leans towards suspicion. While the lack of other negative cues might point to mere anxiety or distraction, the overall pattern makes me lean slightly toward thinking the person might be deceptive. It’s not a clear-cut case by any means, and they could simply be nervous or trying to appear friendly, but given the gaze behavior, there is a reasonable chance they aren’t telling the whole truth.

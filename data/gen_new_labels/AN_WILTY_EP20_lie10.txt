Based on the video, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. They do maintain eye contact, which typically can indicate honesty, but the noticeable sideways glances feel a bit off—as if they’re trying to avoid full eye contact but not managing to do so completely. That subtle avoidance could be a sign of discomfort or concealment. The way their lips are pulled back, almost like a grimace or tight hold, suggests nervousness or an effort to suppress a reaction, which often aligns with stressful deception. Additionally, the frequent eyebrow raises come across as somewhat forced, perhaps an attempt to appear engaged or sincere without actually conveying genuine emotion. 

Still, I can’t rule out that some of these behaviors might just be individual quirks or signs of nervousness unrelated to lying. People do have different ways of expressing themselves, and anxiety alone can produce similar nonverbal cues. However, when you consider the combination of the forced eyebrow movements, the lip tension, and the side glances all together, it does seem more likely they are trying to mask something. It feels like a subtle strain to appear calm and truthful. So while it’s not definitive proof, the evidence subtly points more toward deception than honesty in this scenario.

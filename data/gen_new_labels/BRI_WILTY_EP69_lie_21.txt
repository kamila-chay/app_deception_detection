Looking at the clip, I'm not completely certain, but some cues lean me toward thinking the person might be lying. They raise their eyebrows quite noticeably and keep flicking their gaze sideways instead of maintaining direct eye contact. This kind of avoidance and facial expression can suggest discomfort or an attempt to be cautious with their words, which is sometimes seen in deception. The palms-up gesture they use, which often signals openness or sincerity, complicates things and could indicate they’re trying to appear truthful rather than actually being honest.

Still, these behaviors aren't definitive. The eyebrow raises might simply reflect surprise or uncertainty, and the sideways glance could mean they're just pausing to think or distracted, rather than intentionally concealing something. Unlike classic signs of lying, they don’t seem overly fidgety or fully avoid eye contact, which makes it less clear-cut. Yet, when combined, the eyebrow raises and evasive gaze make me lean slightly toward the possibility that they aren’t telling the whole truth. It’s far from certain, and without additional context or hearing what they’re saying, I can’t say for sure, but these cues suggest a subtle hint of deception rather than straightforward honesty.

Based on the video, I lean toward thinking the person might be lying, though I can’t be completely certain. The subtle upward pull at the corners of their mouth strikes me as somewhat off—not a genuine smile but more of an attempt to appear calm or friendly, which doesn’t quite reach their eyes. This kind of expression sometimes shows up when someone is trying to conceal the truth. Their downward gaze also suggests possible avoidance of eye contact, which is often linked to deception, as people may look away to mentally manage a lie or avoid detection. Additionally, the repetitive chin movements while speaking seem a bit unnatural, as if they’re rehearsing or nervous about their words.

That said, the usual signs of stress or anxiety, like rapid blinking, fidgeting, or visible nervousness, aren’t apparent, which leaves some room for doubt. It's possible the person is just uncomfortable, shy, or thoughtful rather than deceitful. Without hearing what they’re actually saying or having more context, it’s hard to be sure. Still, taken together, these subtle cues make me lean toward the possibility that they might not be fully truthful, even if I’m not ready to say it definitively.

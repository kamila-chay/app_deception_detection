This situation is difficult to judge from the video alone. The person maintains steady eye contact throughout, looking directly at the questioner without shifting their gaze, which is often considered a sign of honesty. Their frequent eyebrow raises suggest surprise or thoughtful processing rather than avoidance or deceit. There are no visible signs of nervousness such as fidgeting, nervous smiles, or lip movements; instead, they appear calm and focused.

However, this calmness and directness could actually be cause for skepticism. Sometimes individuals who are lying deliberately maintain strong eye contact to appear believable, especially if they have rehearsed their story. Their consistent eyebrow lifting might not be genuine surprise but a practiced reaction to seem sincere. The lack of typical stress indicators might indicate over-control rather than truthfulness, which can be a subtle hint towards deception.

Of course, if the person is telling the truth, their expressive eyebrows might just reflect genuine confusion or surprise at the question, and their calm demeanor would naturally align with honesty. Without more context—such as the nature of the question or their usual behavior—it’s tough to be definitive.

Overall, while the cues don’t scream deception outright, they also don’t rule it out convincingly. Given the possibility that the person might be employing a rehearsed facade of calm and eye contact, I’m inclined to lean toward them possibly not being truthful, though it’s far from a certainty. Additional information or follow-up reactions would help clarify matters.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person’s steady eye contact seems a bit too deliberate, almost as if they’re trying hard to appear trustworthy. While avoiding gaze can indicate deception, overcompensating by maintaining intense eye contact is also a known tactic used by those who are lying. The subtle downturn at the corners of their mouth—a slight frown—could suggest they’re under some stress, perhaps from constructing a story, rather than simply concentrating. Although it might just be a natural expression when focused, the combination of this small frown with the intense eye contact raises some questions.

They don’t show typical nervous behaviors like increased blinking, fidgeting, or awkward pauses, which could suggest that they’ve practiced their responses or are deliberately controlling their demeanor to seem calm. This could indicate preparation, a common strategy among those who deceive. While none of these signs alone are definitive, putting them together makes me lean toward the possibility that the person might not be fully truthful. Without more context about the questions being asked or how they respond to specific details, I can’t say for certain, but overall the behaviors hint more toward a controlled, possibly deceptive presentation rather than candid honesty.

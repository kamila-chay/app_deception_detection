Honestly, I'm trying to figure this out myself. I watched the clip a couple of times, and the person seems really calm—sitting still with hands steady, maintaining mostly consistent eye contact, no fidgeting or shifting, and not blinking more than usual. Normally, if someone were lying, you'd expect to see some signs like avoiding eye contact, nervous movements, or hesitant pauses. But here, their behavior is unusually composed, almost like they're telling a story they genuinely remember.

That said, I keep wondering if maybe this calmness is exactly what makes me suspicious. I've heard some liars practice staying perfectly still and maintaining steady eye contact to avoid giving themselves away. So this absence of typical nervous signs doesn't necessarily mean they're truthful; it could mean they're skilled at hiding deception. In fact, the very effortlessness and smoothness in their tone could be deliberate—like they’ve rehearsed it enough to sound natural. Sometimes, when someone is too calm without the usual fluctuations in speech or hesitation, it might signal they're masking something.

I can't say for sure, and it's tricky because not all liars fit the stereotype of being jumpy or uneasy. Some people are just naturally composed, or perhaps they're intentionally projecting calm to cover up the truth. Given all that, I lean toward thinking they might be lying, or at least not being fully honest. It’s not definitive, but the consistent calmness strangely raises more questions than answers.

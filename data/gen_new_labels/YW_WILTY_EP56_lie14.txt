I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if the person is being truthful or not. What stands out to me is that they keep raising their eyebrows repeatedly during the conversation—especially when responding to questions. I've read that this can sometimes be a sign of someone trying to appear innocent or buying time to think, which could indicate deception. Of course, eyebrow-raising can also happen naturally when someone is surprised or emphasizing a point, so it's not definitive. They’re maintaining consistent eye contact, which is often linked to truthfulness since liars sometimes avoid direct gaze, but I know some liars deliberately increase eye contact to appear honest. They're also nodding along, which might suggest engagement, but it could also be a way to seem cooperative regardless of whether they're truthful.

What’s interesting is that I don’t see overt signs of nervousness or classic “deception tells” like fidgeting, gaze avoidance, or forced smiles. They seem calm, with no tense mouth or shifted posture. Normally, I’d expect more stress cues if someone was lying, but absence of these signs doesn’t rule out the possibility. Some individuals are skilled at lying without visible stress, so that calmness could be rehearsed or natural. It’s also possible the eyebrow-raising is just a habitual gesture rather than an indicator of deception.

Taking all this into account, I can't be certain, but I’m leaning somewhat towards the person not being fully truthful. The eyebrow movements combined with the deliberate eye contact feel like they might be managing their behavior to appear honest. It’s subtle and not conclusive, but these cues make me suspect that deception is at least possible here.

Based on the clip, I’m not completely certain, but I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. Their eyebrow movements are unusual—they’re furrowing and raising them at the same time, which suggests a mix of confusion or stress alongside an attempt to appear surprised. This combination feels inconsistent with what they’re saying. Additionally, their gaze frequently flicks sideways while addressing the other person, a behavior often seen when someone is either trying to think carefully or avoid direct eye contact. The occasional head tilts also seem to indicate discomfort or unease, which can sometimes be a sign of processing something awkward or untruthful.

That said, it’s possible they’re simply nervous or anxious, especially if the topic is difficult or they’re recalling something under pressure. They do maintain eye contact overall, which might suggest anxiety rather than outright deception. People can also be very expressive with their eyebrows when trying to concentrate or remember details, so it’s not definitive evidence of lying.

Still, the mixed signals from their facial expressions combined with the sideways glances set off some red flags for me. A person telling the truth and feeling relaxed would likely display more consistent expressions—if confused, their brow would probably only furrow, not simultaneously raise, and a friendly demeanor might include a smile. The conflicting cues here point more toward the likelihood that they’re not being fully honest, though it’s far from certain. I’d hesitate to make a firm accusation without more context or hearing what’s actually said, but overall, I tend to lean toward deception in this case.

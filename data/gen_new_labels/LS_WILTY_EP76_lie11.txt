This one is somewhat challenging to call, but leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. The main thing that stands out is the person’s upward gaze, as if they’re staring at the ceiling or visualizing something. While some argue that looking up can be linked to recalling memories and truth-telling, it is also often associated with fabrication, since people sometimes look up when inventing details. The lack of classic nervous signs—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, no increased blinking or face touching—feels strange. Usually, even a small amount of stress or tension shows up in some way during deception, but here there's a noticeable absence of such cues.

It’s possible the person is simply good at hiding their deception or naturally very composed, which doesn’t necessarily mean they’re truthful; it may just mean they’re skilled at maintaining a calm facade. The fact that their gaze is upward instead of toward the person they’re speaking to raises suspicion, although it’s also possible they’re just thinking hard. Still, this odd combination of steady gaze and blank behavior—with no subtle facial shifts, no raised eyebrows, and no hesitations—feels like a cover rather than genuine calmness.

Given all this, while I wouldn’t say it’s certain, I tend to lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. The lack of normal stress indicators could reflect practiced control rather than honesty. Without more context or information, it’s hard to be definitive, but the cues suggest they might not be entirely truthful.

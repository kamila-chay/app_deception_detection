Based on the video, I'm leaning somewhat toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. They avoid eye contact by consistently looking down, which stands out as a potential red flag since people who are dishonest often do this instead of meeting someone's gaze. Additionally, the frequent raising of their eyebrows could be an attempt to appear surprised or innocent, which is sometimes a tactic used when fabricating a story. While they aren't showing some of the more obvious signs of lying, like fidgeting or awkward pauses, the combination of these subtle cues makes me suspect they could be hiding something. That said, it’s important to note that looking down and raising eyebrows can have innocent explanations, such as thinking deeply or reacting genuinely, so I’m not fully convinced. Overall, I lean toward deception here, but I’d need more context to be more confident.

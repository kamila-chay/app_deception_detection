This is a bit challenging, but based on what I observe in the clip, I tend to lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. Their tension is noticeable—they’re not smiling or laughing, which seems unusual for the situation and suggests they might be holding something back. The frequent head shaking, a clear "no" gesture, combined with repeatedly touching their head or neck, stands out as well. These behaviors are often linked to discomfort and attempts to distance oneself from what’s being said, which can align with deceptive behavior.

While I acknowledge these signs can also stem from nervousness or frustration—like someone simply disagreeing with a question or feeling uneasy—taken together they raise some suspicion. The absence of other common indicators such as avoiding eye contact or excessive blinking adds some ambiguity, and their stiffness might hint at an effort to appear composed, which can sometimes signal dishonesty.

Without knowing the context or the exact questions they're responding to, it’s impossible to be certain, but the balance of these subtle cues nudges me toward thinking they may not be entirely truthful. It’s not definitive, but overall, the behaviors suggest a slight leaning toward deception rather than full honesty.

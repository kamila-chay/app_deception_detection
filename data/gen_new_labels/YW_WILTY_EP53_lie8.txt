This is a bit challenging to determine from the video alone, but I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which some might interpret as a sign of honesty, but it can also be a tactic used by liars to appear sincere. The fact that they show no nervous behaviors—no fidgeting, no blinking excessively, no awkward pauses—seems almost too controlled, which raises some suspicion. Genuine nervousness often manifests in small physical tells, so this unusual calmness might suggest they’ve practiced their demeanor carefully. While it’s possible they’re just naturally composed, the extreme steadiness and lack of typical signs of tension lean me toward thinking they may be deceiving. Without additional context or hearing what they say, it’s hard to be certain, but overall, I tend to believe there’s a good chance they’re not being entirely truthful.

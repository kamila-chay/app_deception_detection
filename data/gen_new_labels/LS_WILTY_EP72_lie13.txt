While it's difficult to be certain just from the video, there are subtle cues that suggest the person might not be entirely truthful. They appear calm, yet their occasional downward glances, combined with raised eyebrows, could hint at some underlying discomfort or an attempt to manage their expressions, which might be signs of stress or deception. Although they maintain eye contact and don’t exhibit overt nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding gaze completely, these subtle gestures—such as looking down while still facing the person—aren't entirely typical for someone confidently telling the truth. It's possible these are just habits or signs of thoughtfulness, but given the context is unknown, these mixed signals lean me slightly toward suspecting they could be concealing something. While I wouldn’t assert they’re definitely lying, the balance of evidence nudges me to lean more towards the possibility of deception than full honesty.

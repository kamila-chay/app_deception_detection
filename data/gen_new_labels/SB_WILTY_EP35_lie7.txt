Based on the video, I’m inclined to think that the person might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. They maintain eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, but the way they blink so much feels unusual and could signal stress or nervousness, which sometimes accompanies deception. Their frequent chin and head movements, along with those quick sideways glances, also give me pause. These behaviors can indicate discomfort or attempts to manage their story, which might align with lying. At the same time, such actions could simply reflect someone thinking hard or feeling anxious, so it’s not definitive. They don’t smile or fidget with their hands or face, which might suggest they’re trying to stay composed, but that could also be part of masking their true feelings. Overall, the combination of excessive blinking and shifting gaze leads me to lean toward the notion that they could be deceptive, though I’m far from certain. There’s enough uncertainty to leave room for other explanations, but my impression is that deception is a plausible explanation here.

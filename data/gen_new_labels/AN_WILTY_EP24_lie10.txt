Based on the video, the person maintains steady, unwavering eye contact throughout the conversation—no looking away or shifting gaze at all. This stands out because while some say liars avoid eye contact to appear more honest, others point out that some skilled or rehearsed liars actually hold eye contact to seem credible. The fact that this person is so focused and calm, without any visible nervous ticks like fidgeting or awkward pauses, could suggest they’re comfortable with what they’re saying. However, that very calmness combined with the somewhat rigid, overly steady eye contact feels a bit off—like it might be rehearsed or forced rather than natural. It doesn’t quite fit the relaxed, spontaneous look of someone telling the truth. Without context or knowing the topic, it’s hard to be certain, but this intense, controlled gaze raises a red flag. While there are no other clear signs of deception, these subtle cues lean me toward suspecting the person might be lying, even if it’s not definitive.

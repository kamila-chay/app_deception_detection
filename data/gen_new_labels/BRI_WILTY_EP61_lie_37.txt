Honestly, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. They appear unnervingly calm—no smiles, no frowns, barely any blinking—and their complete avoidance of eye contact stands out. Instead of engaging with whoever’s asking the questions, they seem to be staring right through the camera. Usually, when someone is nervous or deceitful, you’d expect some subtle signs like fidgeting or glancing away, but here, the stillness feels almost too deliberate, like they’re forcing themselves to appear calm. That controlled behavior can often be a red flag because people who are genuine tend to show at least slight, natural reactions like shifting posture or quick glances.

Of course, there's always the chance they're simply reserved or culturally inclined to avoid direct eye contact, which makes it tricky to be certain. Some truthful individuals manage to mask their emotions really well, especially if they’re shy or coming from a background where those nervous habits aren’t common. Plus, practiced liars can also be composed, so it’s not definitive.

Still, the way they keep their gaze averted makes me suspicious; if they were telling the truth, I’d expect some effort to connect, even if it’s minimal. It seems like a deliberate avoidance rather than mere discomfort. So while I can’t say for sure, I tend to suspect deception because their complete lack of any reaction feels off—as if they’re rehearsed or emotionally detached. It’s almost too perfect, and that impression pushes me toward thinking they might be lying, even though it remains ambiguous.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m leaning slightly toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s far from certain. The repeated eyebrow raises stand out as the main visible gesture, and while eyebrow raises can sometimes indicate surprise or confusion, they’re also often linked to stress or internal conflict, which can show up when someone is being deceptive. It’s notable that they aren’t looking at the person they’re talking to at all, which feels a bit unusual—most people would usually glance over occasionally, even if they’re uncomfortable. The absence of other classic nervous signs like fidgeting, blinking, or lip biting makes the picture confusing, but sometimes skilled liars keep their movements very controlled.

On the other hand, the lack of more nervous behaviors might suggest they’re simply good at hiding their discomfort or that this is their baseline way of reacting to questions. Some people naturally raise their eyebrows a lot when thinking, and cultural differences might explain the avoidance of direct eye contact, which complicates interpreting this as a clear sign of deception. Still, the fact that they avoid eye contact altogether, combined with the eyebrow raises, leans me a bit toward thinking they might be hiding something. It feels unusual that if they were telling the truth, they wouldn’t show more openness or less tension in some form.

So, while I wouldn’t be confident enough to say they’re definitely lying, the cues present and their odd combination make me lean toward the possibility that deception is at play here. More context or additional footage would be needed to be more certain, but for now the signs point a little more in the direction of them not being entirely truthful.

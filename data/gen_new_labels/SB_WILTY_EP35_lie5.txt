This is a bit difficult to judge from just the video, but I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive. They keep their eyes downcast the whole time, avoiding direct eye contact, which is a common sign of someone hiding something. The tight frown and the way their eyebrows are knotted together also suggest a level of tension that often accompanies dishonesty. The head turning to the side seems like another avoidance behavior, as if they're uncomfortable revealing the full truth. 

While it’s true that these signs could also be explained by genuine upset or nervousness, the overall combination feels more like an effort to conceal something rather than just emotional discomfort. The absence of any forced or overly polite smiles, which might indicate a cover story, doesn’t necessarily point to honesty here—it could simply mean they’re trying hard to keep their composure without revealing a false front. 

I can’t say for certain they’re lying, but the behavioral cues do make me lean toward deception rather than complete truthfulness. It’s plausible they might be masking their true feelings or trying to withhold information. Without more context, I can’t be definite, but my impression tilts toward them not being entirely honest.

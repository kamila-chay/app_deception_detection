Looking at the clip, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying. The way they're raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes wide comes across as somewhat forced, as if they're trying too hard to appear engaged or sincere. Their gaze upward is often considered a cue associated with fabricating a story rather than recalling genuine memories. Additionally, the frequent nodding during their speech feels like overcompensation to seem agreeable. The lack of smiling or laughter might also suggest they're suppressing natural reactions, which can be a sign of deception.

While the open arms, direct eye contact, and leaning in typically suggest honesty, in this case, those gestures could be part of a crafted effort to appear trustworthy. Their gaze toward the person they’re speaking to seems genuine, but combined with the other cues, it doesn’t fully dispel suspicion. It’s possible they’re just nervous or stressed, which might explain some of the behaviors, but given the mixture of signs, I’m inclined to suspect they may not be entirely truthful. Ultimately, it’s not certain, but the overall impression leans toward them possibly being deceptive.

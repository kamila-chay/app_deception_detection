Honestly, I'm not completely certain, but overall, I lean somewhat toward thinking they might not be fully truthful. The consistent backward movement of their head feels telling—it’s as if they’re distancing themselves physically from what they’re saying, which strikes me as a defensive gesture rather than one of engagement or honesty. That, combined with the raised eyebrows that seem more tense than genuinely surprised, suggests they might be trying to mask discomfort or unease.

On the other hand, the steady eye contact and open palm gestures generally point toward sincerity, since people who lie often avoid looking directly at others or exhibit more typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting. Their calm voice also doesn’t carry the usual signs of stress that sometimes accompany deception. 

Yet, even so, the repeated head movement and the somewhat strained expression around the eyes make me lean a bit more toward the possibility that they’re not telling the whole truth. It’s still possible they’re just reflective or naturally expressive, and without knowing the context or the questions being answered, I can’t say for sure. However, taken together, these cues make me inclined to suspect some level of deception, though it remains far from definitive.

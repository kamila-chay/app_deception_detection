Looking at this clip, I'm not entirely certain, but some of the cues suggest the person might be leaning toward deception. They maintain direct eye contact, which usually signals honesty, but sometimes liars do that deliberately to appear credible. While their nodding and open-handed, relaxed posture typically indicate openness, these gestures can also be consciously employed to seem trustworthy. What stands out more are the frequent, almost constant blinking and the raised eyebrows during their responses—these signs often correlate with nervousness or stress, which can accompany lying, even when someone tries to mask it.  

On the other hand, it’s possible they're just genuinely nervous or expressive, especially if the topic is sensitive or they’re uncomfortable on camera. The slight, polite smile and quick head shake could simply reflect natural reactions rather than deception. Still, those increased blinking and eyebrow movements give me pause.  

Overall, while some body language cues lean toward truthfulness, the nervous habits make me suspicious. I wouldn’t say they’re definitively lying, but I find myself leaning slightly toward the possibility they might be concealing something. Without hearing the content or seeing more context, it remains uncertain, but my impression tilts toward deception rather than full honesty.

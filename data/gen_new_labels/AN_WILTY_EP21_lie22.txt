Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I tend to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying. The combined nodding and head shaking is quite unusual—it gives the impression that they're trying to convey both agreement and disagreement simultaneously, which can often indicate someone is attempting to conceal the truth or is uncertain about how to respond honestly. Their wandering gaze, mostly looking down and then darting sideways, often aligns with discomfort or avoidance of eye contact, which can be a sign of deception. Additionally, the slight downward movement of their chin, as if pulling their head in, suggests a defensive or closed-off posture that might point to them feeling uneasy about revealing the truth.

That said, I’m not fully convinced this is definitive proof of lying. It’s possible they’re just really nervous or stressed, especially if the topic is difficult or if they're unaccustomed to being on camera. Some individuals naturally look down or glance sideways when thinking, and the mixed head gestures could simply be their way of trying to communicate uncertainty rather than deceit. There are no blatant indicators like excessive blinking or forced smiles, which often accompany dishonesty. Still, given these subtle cues, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that they might not be telling the truth, though it's not certain without additional context.

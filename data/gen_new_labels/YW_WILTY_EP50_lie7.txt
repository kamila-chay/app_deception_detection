Looking closely at this clip, I’m starting to lean slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive. While they do appear calm and maintain consistent eye contact with open arms, which usually suggests confidence or honesty, these signs might actually be part of a deliberate effort to appear truthful. Skilled liars can often maintain such composed behavior to mask their deception. The raised eyebrows stand out to me—they occur a few times, almost as if the person is surprised or skeptical about what they’re saying. This gesture can sometimes indicate someone trying to seem innocent or rehearsed, which could hint at dishonesty rather than straightforward truthfulness.

Although the absence of classic nervous behaviors like fidgeting or looking away might initially support their credibility, it’s also possible that they’re simply controlling those typical tells purposefully. The open arms and steady gaze might be gestures meant to convey trustworthiness rather than signs of genuine openness. Without additional context or further interaction, it’s difficult to be certain, but overall the subtle cues suggest to me that the person might not be completely truthful. I wouldn’t say they’re definitely lying, but I do lean toward deception based on the mixed signals and especially the eyebrow movements.

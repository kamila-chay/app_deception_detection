I'm not entirely certain, but leaning toward the idea that they might be lying. While they are smiling subtly and maintaining steady eye contact, which can indicate sincerity, the occasional glance upward catches my attention. That upward look could suggest they are trying to recall details that aren't genuine. The smile might seem natural at first glance, but it could also be a subtle mask to appear friendly while hiding something. The absence of typical nervous behaviors like fidgeting or awkward pauses makes it harder to be sure, but some people are skilled at concealing deceit, so the calm demeanor doesn't guarantee truthfulness. Overall, given the mixed signals—the quiet smile combined with the upward glance—I lean slightly toward the possibility that they are not being entirely truthful, even though it’s not definitive.

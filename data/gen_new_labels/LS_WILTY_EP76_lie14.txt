I'm watching this clip and trying to figure out if they're being truthful, but I’m starting to lean toward the idea that they might be lying. They maintain steady eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, but I’ve heard that some people who lie intentionally hold eye contact to appear sincere. The eyebrow raises could be genuine surprise, but they might also be a little too deliberate—like a rehearsed attempt to show engagement. They don’t fidget or look away, which typically signals truthfulness, but it could also mean they’re practiced at hiding nervousness. The lack of obvious signs like sweating or avoiding the question doesn’t rule out deception; it might just point to a calm, controlled lie. Without more context, it’s tough to say for certain, but based on these subtle cues, I find myself leaning more toward the possibility that they aren’t being completely honest.

Based on what I’m seeing in the video, I’m starting to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. They maintain direct eye contact with the camera, which often suggests openness or honesty, but their eyes mostly glance upward rather than down or sideways. Some research suggests that looking up can indicate someone is constructing or fabricating a story, rather than recalling a genuine memory. 

They don’t show typical nervous signs like fidgeting, awkward silences, or forced facial expressions, which might usually signal deception. However, the absence of these signs isn’t definitive—some people are naturally calm or skilled at masking their true feelings, especially if they're experienced in deception or not feeling pressured.

While the lack of obvious nervous cues might suggest truthfulness at first glance, the upward gaze combined with the other factors makes me suspect there could be some level of dishonesty. Without knowing the content of their story, it’s tough to be certain, but overall, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that they may not be completely truthful.

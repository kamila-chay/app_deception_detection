As I watch this clip, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. They raise their eyebrows a few times while answering, which can sometimes be a subtle sign of uncertainty or an attempt to appear innocent. The shrug they do feels a bit like a dismissive or evasive gesture rather than a natural response—almost as if they're trying to downplay something or avoid giving a direct answer. Their eye contact is mostly steady, which usually suggests honesty, but the occasional glance upward could be them searching for a story or fabricating details rather than simply recalling information.

Though they don’t display the more obvious signs of deception like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the combination of raised eyebrows and shrugging makes me suspicious. These cues aren’t definitive on their own, and it’s possible they’re just an expressive person or genuinely unsure, but taken together, they slightly tip the scale toward possible deception. The lack of smiles or relaxed demeanor during what might be a casual conversation also adds to an impression of stiffness that feels a little off. So while I can't say with certainty that they're lying, I’m inclined to think they might be stretching the truth or not fully honest here.

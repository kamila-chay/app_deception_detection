Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but based on what I just watched, I'm leaning slightly toward the person possibly being deceptive—though I could easily be mistaken. One thing that caught my attention was how they raised their eyebrows a couple of times while answering, especially when asked about a specific detail. From what I've seen before, raised eyebrows can sometimes indicate someone is trying to conceal something or is nervous, which can be a subtle sign of deception, even if it’s not as obvious as avoiding eye contact or fidgeting.

On the other hand, they didn’t avoid eye contact; in fact, they maintained steady eye contact throughout, which normally suggests honesty. They also spoke smoothly without stammering or awkward pauses, which I’d expect if they were telling the truth. The calm and steady delivery aligns with that impression, although those eyebrow lifts still make me question if something was off.

It’s possible those raised eyebrows were just a genuine reaction, like surprise or processing a difficult question, since people do that all the time when thinking. If they were lying, I might expect more classic cues like looking away or touching their face, but none of that happened here. 

Still, putting these observations together, the eyebrow raises combined with the other subtle signs make me lean toward the possibility that they might not be fully truthful. This isn’t definitive by any means, but I’d say there’s a chance some deception is happening—though without more context or information, it’s hard to be certain.

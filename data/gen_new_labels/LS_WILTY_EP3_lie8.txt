Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't be completely certain. The repeated raising of their eyebrows could be an attempt to appear surprised or mask nervousness, and their chin movements—sort of nodding without fully nodding—along with frequent glances down and sideways rather than direct eye contact, align with behaviors often associated with deception. People who lie often avoid steady eye contact or look away, and while these actions might also indicate someone trying to recall information or feeling awkward, they do raise a slight suspicion. 

At the same time, there are aspects that don’t neatly fit the classic signs of lying. The absence of forced smiles or laughter and lack of hand fidgeting or face touching—common signs of stress or discomfort—make it less definitive. Their head turning sideways might be a natural gesture rather than an attempt to distance themselves from the conversation, suggesting a more neutral or shy demeanor rather than outright dishonesty.

The cues here are mixed, but leaning toward deception seems more plausible given the combination of avoiding eye contact and particular facial movements, even though these could still be explained by nervousness or distraction. While it’s far from a sure thing and more context would be helpful, my impression is that the person is probably not being entirely truthful.

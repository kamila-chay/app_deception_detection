Based on what I'm seeing in the video, it seems more likely that they might be lying, though I wouldn't say it's certain. They do maintain consistent eye contact and have open arms, which often indicate honesty, but some subtle cues make me suspicious. The frequent eyebrow raises give off a sense that they might be skeptical or unsure about their own words, which can be a sign of someone constructing a story rather than recounting truth. The slight head tilt and repeated touching of their face or head come across as nervous behaviors, which sometimes accompany deception. While these actions could simply mean they're thinking hard or feeling anxious, when combined, they lean more toward someone feeling uneasy about being truthful.  

I’m aware that they’re not displaying some of the more classic signs of lying, like avoiding eye contact or covering their mouth, and their body language doesn’t scream dishonesty in an overt way. It’s possible that their behavior is just stress or pressure from the situation rather than deception. Nonetheless, the mix of these subtle behaviors nudges me towards suspecting they might not be telling the full truth. I wouldn’t say it’s a definitive conclusion, but overall, I lean somewhat toward the idea that they could be lying. More context or information would definitely be needed to be more confident.

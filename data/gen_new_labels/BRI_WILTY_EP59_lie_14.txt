While the person maintains steady eye contact, which often suggests honesty, the sharp raising of their eyebrows when questioned is a notable detail that raises some suspicion. This kind of reaction can sometimes indicate someone is caught off guard while fabricating a story or feeling some stress, rather than simply being surprised. Though there are no classic signs of nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or awkward pauses, the calm demeanor might just reflect someone who is skilled at concealing deceit. Given this, I lean slightly toward the possibility that they may be lying, even if the evidence isn’t overwhelming. It’s not certain, but the eyebrow movement combined with the lack of other clear indicators makes me somewhat skeptical. More context or the full conversation would be necessary to reach a firmer conclusion.

Honestly, while there are some signs that could point to honesty—like the steady eye contact and absence of nervous gestures—the overall impression makes me lean toward the idea that they might not be telling the truth. The intense scowl and furrowed eyebrows suggest more than just neutral emotion; there's clear tension there. The head shaking comes across as a firm denial, which often aligns with someone trying to reject something they're actually involved in. Additionally, the downward pull of the lip corners hints at frustration or discomfort, possibly linked to stress about being deceptive. 

That said, I’m not completely certain. It's possible these expressions stem from genuine annoyance or irritation, especially if the question was invasive or upsetting, and some people do habitually shake their heads without meaning to deceive. Plus, their calm demeanor and lack of fidgeting usually indicate honesty. Still, weighing the evidence, I find myself leaning toward the likelihood of deception, though I wouldn’t be fully confident without more context, particularly about what was asked and the full nature of the interaction.

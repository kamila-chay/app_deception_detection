Looking at the clip, I lean toward thinking the person might be lying, though it's not certain. They avoid direct eye contact and glance sideways frequently, which often suggests discomfort or an attempt to conceal something. Their head moving backward, as if pulling away, can also indicate unease or a desire to distance themselves from what’s being said. While their palms are up, a gesture usually associated with openness and honesty, it could also be a deliberate move to appear trustworthy and mask deception. Additionally, the raised eyebrows and seemingly exaggerated reaction might be attempts to fake surprise or deflect suspicion.

On the other hand, the absence of some typical signs of lying—like smiling, frowning, awkward pauses, or nervous hand gestures—does complicate the picture. They're relatively still and not showing overt stress, which might suggest calmness under pressure or uncertainty rather than deceit. However, skilled deceivers often maintain a composed demeanor to avoid giving away their true feelings. Overall, the cues present make me lean more toward the possibility that they are not being completely truthful, even though the evidence isn't definitive. Without hearing the actual conversation, it’s tough to be sure, but I tend to suspect some level of deception here.

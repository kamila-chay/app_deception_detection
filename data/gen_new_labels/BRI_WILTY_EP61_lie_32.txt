Watching the clip, I'm leaning toward thinking the person might be lying, though it's not entirely clear. While they don’t display many of the classic signs of deception—no fidgeting, awkward pauses, or fake smiles—the repeated eyebrow raises during questioning stand out. That could suggest they’re trying to appear innocent or surprised, which sometimes points to dishonesty. Their avoidance of direct eye contact also raises some suspicion, even though it might just be shyness or distraction. The absence of more obvious signs like sweating or shifting around complicates things, but it’s possible they’re just skilled at masking their discomfort. All in all, the subtle cues, especially the eyebrow movements combined with their gaze, make me lean toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful, though I can’t say that with full confidence.

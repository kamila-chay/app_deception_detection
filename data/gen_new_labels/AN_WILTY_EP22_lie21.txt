Looking at this clip, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though I can’t be entirely certain. Their tense expression—with furrowed brows, a scowl, and lips pulled down—combined with a firm side-to-side head shake feels a bit forced, as if they’re resisting something rather than simply recounting a straightforward story. The open palms facing up add to an impression that they might be trying to appear honest, but this contrast with their intense negative expressions creates a sense of incongruity.

At the same time, it’s possible these signs reflect genuine frustration or annoyance rather than deception. Their maintained eye contact suggests they’re engaged with the question, not avoiding it, which can sometimes indicate sincerity. Also, they don’t display typical signs of nervousness associated with lying, like frequent blinking or looking away, and there are no awkward pauses or fidgeting that might suggest guilt.

Still, the combination of scowling, the head shake, and open palms strikes me as a little off—almost like they’re forcefully rejecting the truth, which leans towards deception in my view. I’m hesitant to be definitive, though, since they could simply be upset or defensive for reasons unrelated to lying. Without more context, it's difficult to say for sure, but overall I tend to lean slightly towards the idea that they might not be entirely truthful here.

Looking at the clip, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though I can’t say for sure. The combination of raised eyebrows and frowning brows creates a kind of facial tension that often suggests someone is uneasy or trying to come up with a story, which could be a sign of deception. Their lips are pushed out as well, which sometimes happens when people are concentrating hard or holding something back, rather than being fully open. While they do maintain eye contact and have their arms wide open—gestures that typically signal honesty—those same behaviors can also be used to appear genuine even when someone isn’t telling the truth.

It’s possible the open arms are just their normal posture and the lip movement a nervous tic, but given the facial tension and that combination of cues, I’m inclined to think there’s a chance they’re not being entirely honest. The direct gaze complicates things, since avoiding eye contact is often linked to lying, but that’s not always the case. Still, the mixed signals, especially the kind of facial tension we see here, make me lean toward suspicion. Without more context, I can’t be certain, but on balance, it feels more likely they might be trying to hide something.

This is a bit challenging, but as I watch the clip, a few things stand out that make me lean toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. They remain calm overall, without obvious nervous gestures or facial expressions, but their blinking is noticeably frequent—much more than usual. This increased blinking could indicate stress or discomfort, which is sometimes linked to deception. The fact that they blink so often might suggest they’re trying to manage their nerves or avoid fully engaging, even though they mostly maintain steady eye contact with the camera.

While it’s true that blinking can increase for many reasons, like tiredness or environmental factors, the combination of frequent blinking with a lack of other typical “truthfulness” cues—such as natural ease or spontaneity—raises some questions. They are not showing other nervous behaviors like fidgeting or avoiding gaze, which could mean they’re consciously controlling their demeanor, possibly to mask dishonesty or because they’ve rehearsed their responses thoroughly.

There’s no definitive sign that proves they’re lying, and the absence of classic tells makes the situation ambiguous, but the blinking pattern stands out enough to cause suspicion. I don’t want to jump to strong conclusions, but based on what I see, I’d say it’s more likely than not that they’re being less than fully honest. More context or additional observations would help clarify the situation, but for now, I lean toward the possibility that they might be deceiving.

Looking at the clip, I'm leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. Although they appear calm—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, and maintaining steady eye contact, which are usually signs of honesty—there are subtle cues that give me pause. For instance, their frequent eyebrow raises could indicate an attempt to appear surprised or confused, which might be a stress response tied to deception rather than a genuine reaction. While the open palms are typically a sign of openness, they could also be a deliberate effort to seem trustworthy, almost as if they’re trying too hard.  

The overall calmness seems a bit too controlled, which is sometimes a red flag in deceptive behavior; rehearsed answers often come with a kind of composed demeanor that masks nervousness. And although the absence of more obvious signs—like forced smiles, lip biting, or gaze aversion—usually supports truthfulness, it could also mean the person is skilled at managing those tells. Given these mixed signals, I don’t want to state outright that they’re lying, but I do lean toward the possibility that they might be hiding something. The balance of cues feels a bit off, so while I’m not convinced they’re definitely being deceptive, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance they’re not telling the whole truth.

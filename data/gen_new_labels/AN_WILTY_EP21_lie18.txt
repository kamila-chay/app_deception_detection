Looking at this clip, there are some signs that make me lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can't be entirely sure. For instance, their avoidance of eye contact—they keep looking down rather than engaging with whoever they're speaking to, which often suggests discomfort or evasiveness. Additionally, the way they raise their eyebrows several times feels somewhat off, like they're trying to appear surprised or nervous, which can sometimes be a sign someone is struggling to come up with a truthful answer. These subtle cues nudge me toward suspecting deception.

That said, these behaviors aren't definitive proof. People often look down when they're shy or concentrating, so it's possible they're simply thinking hard about their response. Similarly, eyebrow raises can be a natural reaction to confusion or processing information, not necessarily an indicator of dishonesty. The absence of more obvious nervous behaviors—such as fidgeting, face-touching, or awkward pauses—also tempers suspicion, since those are commonly expected when someone is lying.

Overall, while the gaze avoidance and eyebrow movements raise some red flags, the lack of other typical nervous signs makes it a bit ambiguous. Still, given these cues, I tend to lean slightly toward the possibility that they might be deceptive, though I wouldn’t say it’s certain. Without more context or further observation of their usual behavior, it’s hard to make a confident judgement, but the indicators I see do make me somewhat skeptical of their truthfulness.

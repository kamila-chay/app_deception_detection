Looking at this clip, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I'm not entirely certain. The frequent downward gaze stands out, as they're avoiding eye contact with the speaker. While looking down can sometimes mean shyness or distraction, it is also a common behavior when someone is nervous or trying to conceal something. Coupled with this, the repeated touching of their head or face—like adjusting their hair or rubbing their neck—could be signs of nervousness often linked to deception. Although those actions might also be harmless habits, their combination with the downward gaze raises some suspicion.

They don’t show blatant signs like fake smiles or excessive blinking, and they aren’t completely avoiding eye contact, but the subtle cues seem to tilt things toward discomfort or unease, which can be associated with lying. The fact that they remain otherwise still doesn’t rule out deception; sometimes people try to control their movements to avoid giving themselves away. Without knowing the context or the questions being asked, it’s difficult to be sure, but given these hints, I find myself leaning slightly toward the possibility that they may not be entirely truthful.

After watching the clip carefully, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be telling the truth. Their tendency to glance down and to the side instead of maintaining eye contact with the camera or the person they're speaking to feels a bit off, as avoiding direct eye contact can often be a sign of dishonesty. The raised eyebrow seems somewhat tense and forced rather than natural, suggesting they might be trying too hard to appear casual. Additionally, the absence of smiling or laughter gives off a guarded vibe, which can be common when someone is trying to conceal something.

That said, I’m not entirely convinced this behavior definitively means they're lying. People sometimes look away because they’re thinking deeply, feeling shy, or caught off guard. The sideways glance might just be them checking something in the room or their notes rather than attempting to hide the truth. It’s also interesting that they don’t exhibit typical nervous habits like fidgeting or touching their face, which makes me wonder if their composure is genuine or if they are simply well-rehearsed or skilled at deception. Some individuals naturally avoid eye contact, and the eyebrow raise could have been a reaction of surprise instead of guilt.

Overall, the cues suggest possible deception, but it’s far from certain. If I had to make a call based solely on what I see, I’d tend to think they’re lying, but I’d definitely want more context before feeling confident about that conclusion. The video alone doesn’t provide enough evidence to know for sure.

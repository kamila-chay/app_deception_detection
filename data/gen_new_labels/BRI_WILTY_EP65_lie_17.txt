Based on the clip, I'm leaning somewhat toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I wouldn't say it's certain. What catches my attention is the way they keep raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes very wide, which feels a bit forced or unnatural—almost as if they are trying extra hard to appear attentive or surprised. This kind of exaggerated expression can sometimes be a sign of nervousness linked to deception. At the same time, they stay fairly still, with no other obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which tempers my suspicion a bit.

The lack of classic indicators such as hand movements or forced smiles makes me hesitate to be fully confident in calling it a lie. Still, that exaggerated eye-opening stands out as a behavior that seems somewhat overplayed for a normal interaction. It could just be their natural expressiveness or excitement, but it also might be an unconscious effort to convince others of their sincerity. Without knowing the context or what they're actually saying, it’s tough to be sure, but the behavior leans in the direction of deception more than honesty, at least to me. I’d remain open to other explanations, though, since it’s not definitive by any means.

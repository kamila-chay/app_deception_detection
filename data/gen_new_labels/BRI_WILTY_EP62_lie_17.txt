From what I observe in the clip, the person appears somewhat fidgety—they blink a lot more than usual, almost as if they're avoiding eye contact or feeling particularly stressed. Additionally, they keep crossing their fingers, which seems unusual since it's not a typical gesture in casual conversation. These behaviors combined make me lean towards the idea that they might be hiding something, though I can't be entirely certain. While frequent blinking can result from many factors—such as dry eyes, harsh lighting, or natural nervousness even when being truthful—and crossing fingers can simply be a habitual or hopeful gesture, the combination still raises some doubts. They don’t display other common signs of discomfort like avoiding eye contact fully or showing heightened physical unease, which makes the situation less clear-cut. On the other hand, if they were lying, the finger crossing might be an unconscious attempt to "cross their fingers" for their lie to hold up, or a self-soothing action to reduce anxiety. Yet, the absence of more typical indicators like hand fidgeting, shifting in their seat, or unusual pauses suggests it might just be a personal quirk or nervous habit. Considering this, I'm inclined to suspect some level of deception, even if the signs aren’t definitive. It feels somewhat off, and while I wouldn't want to state outright that they’re lying, my intuition leans in that direction, and I’d want more information before forming a firmer judgment.

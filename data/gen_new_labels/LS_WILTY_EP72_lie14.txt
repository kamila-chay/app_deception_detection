After watching the clip a few times, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I wouldn’t say it’s certain. Their face is unusually still—no smiles or frowns—which by itself wouldn’t be out of place. However, the way their lips are pulled back tightly with noticeable tension feels a bit unnatural, almost like they’re forcing themselves to keep a neutral expression. It’s not a typical relaxed mouth position you’d expect in a normal conversation.

That lip tension stands out because it can be a subtle cue people give off when they’re uncomfortable or trying to hold back something, perhaps even a truth they don’t want to reveal. While it’s true that some folks do this when concentrating hard and trying to phrase their thoughts carefully, this kind of controlled expression can sometimes mask deception, as if they’re rehearsing their words or suppressing an emotional response. 

Other than that, their overall behavior doesn’t scream dishonesty—no obvious nervous gestures, no eye-avoidance, no awkward pauses. They sit quite still and don’t display the typical signs of lying body language, which complicates the judgment. Still, that mouth tension keeps drawing my attention because it just doesn’t quite feel natural or relaxed.

Of course, they might just habitually hold their lips that way, or it could be a nervous tic or even just dry lips, but combined with the context, it tilts the impression slightly toward deception. So while I wouldn’t be ready to declare outright that they’re lying, I do find myself leaning in that direction, suspecting that the tightness is a subtle sign of forced control rather than genuine calmness.

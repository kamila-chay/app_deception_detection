Based on what I’m seeing in the video, the person appears very calm and composed while speaking—there are no obvious signs of nervousness such as fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or excessive blinking. They maintain steady eye contact, have a relaxed posture, and their hands and facial expressions don’t seem to be hiding anything. However, their stillness feels almost too controlled. Typically, even unpracticed liars display some subtle signs of tension like fidgeting or a forced smile, but here, everything seems unusually smooth. This level of composure could suggest they are deliberately suppressing normal nervous responses. 

Considering this, it seems plausible that they might be a skilled liar who has rehearsed to eliminate the usual tells and is comfortable enough not to show stress about being caught. The absence of typical deceptive cues might indicate practiced deception rather than honesty. Of course, since the video doesn’t include their actual words, it’s hard to be certain without more context, but purely from their behavior, I find myself leaning toward the possibility that they might not be truthful. It’s not definitive, but given the unnatural stillness and lack of expected tension, I’d cautiously suspect they could be lying.

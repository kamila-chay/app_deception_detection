Based on what I’m seeing in the video, I’m leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying. Their tight smile and unusually high raised eyebrows give off a sense that they could be trying a bit too hard to appear surprised or engaged, which feels somewhat forced. The repeated chin movements, almost like nodding to themselves, alongside their gaze flicking sideways instead of maintaining eye contact, often suggest discomfort or avoidance—common signs associated with deception. The smile doesn’t come across as natural or relaxed, which further raises some suspicion.

That said, I wouldn’t say it’s certain. The smile could be polite or an attempt to seem friendly, and raised eyebrows might simply mean the person is paying close attention. Their chin motion might just be a nervous quirk, and side glances can happen when someone is thinking or self-conscious, not necessarily lying. Their open arm posture seems to signal openness rather than closed-off defensiveness, which one might expect if they were definitely hiding something.

So while the signals do lean in the direction of deception, they’re not definitive. Without more context or information, I can’t be sure, but based on the current cues, I lean toward the likelihood that the person could be lying.

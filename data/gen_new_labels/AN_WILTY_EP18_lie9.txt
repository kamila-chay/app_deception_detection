Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely clear-cut. They appear composed and maintain eye contact, nodding and tilting their head, which are behaviors often associated with genuine engagement. However, the steady nature of their demeanor feels almost too controlled—there's an absence of typical nervous cues like fidgeting or shifting that sometimes accompany honesty under pressure. 

The upward gaze caught my attention as well; it can be a subtle signal that someone is constructing a story rather than recalling a genuine memory. While looking up doesn’t always mean deception—it could simply indicate thinking hard—combined with their otherwise overly composed behavior, it raises some doubt. The natural head tilting and nodding could be genuine, but they might also be part of a practiced effort to appear sincere without overdoing it.

Since there are no obvious signs like lip biting or excessive blinking, it’s possible they’re just calm, or they might be skilled at hiding their nervousness. Without more context on what’s being said, it’s difficult to be sure. Yet, given the combination of subtle cues, I tend to suspect a degree of deception rather than complete honesty, though I wouldn’t be fully confident in calling it out. It’s more likely that they’re leaning toward being untruthful, but the evidence isn’t definitive.

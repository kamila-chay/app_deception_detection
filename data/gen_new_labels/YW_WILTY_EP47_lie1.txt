Honestly, watching this, I’m leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying, though I wouldn’t say it with full confidence. They maintain eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, but the frequent sideways glances seem a bit off. It’s as if they’re not fully engaged or maybe trying to avoid something, which can be a subtle sign of discomfort or deception. Their head moving slightly backward could be another hint of distancing themselves from the conversation, something that can occur when someone feels uneasy or is being less than truthful.

On the other hand, their palms remain open and visible, which typically signals openness and sincerity. That contradicts what I’d expect from someone lying, since liars often hide their hands or fidget nervously. It makes me wonder if the sideways glances are just a nervous tick or if there’s more to it. Maybe they’re thinking about their next words, or just shifting position, but combined with the other cues, it leans toward some level of unease.

Overall, while the absence of classic signs like avoiding eye contact or excessive blinking suggests they might be telling the truth, the subtle but persistent sideways glances and slight backward head movement point to the possibility of deception. I wouldn’t bet on it entirely, but if I had to guess based solely on the body language, I’d lean a bit toward them not being completely honest.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though it's not entirely clear. Their smile, while frequent, seems somewhat forced, especially when discussing potentially sensitive topics, which can be a subtle sign of discomfort or deception. The frequent raised eyebrows might be an attempt to appear surprised or innocent, which sometimes people do when they're trying to convince others. The most striking cue is the exaggerated closing of their eyes, as if they're deliberately squeezing them shut, which feels like they might be avoiding straightforwardness or trying to fabricate something. While this could be dramatics, it does raise some suspicion.

On the other hand, their open palms and steady eye contact suggest openness and sincerity. There's a lack of obvious nervous behavior like fidgeting or gaze avoidance, which might make you hesitate to label them as lying outright. The smile could indeed be genuine or a polite gesture.

All things considered, while there are signs pointing toward possible deception—particularly the forced smile and exaggerated eye closure—the overall impression isn’t definitive. It seems more likely than not that they are not being entirely truthful, but there’s still enough ambiguity that it’s hard to be certain. I’d say they probably lean toward hiding something, but it isn’t an open-and-shut case.

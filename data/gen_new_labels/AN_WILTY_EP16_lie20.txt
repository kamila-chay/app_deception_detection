Watching the clip, I get the sense that this person might be leaning towards deception, though it’s not entirely clear-cut. They appear composed, maintaining steady eye contact and a calm posture, which typically suggests honesty. Their head movements, like the side-to-side shake when saying "no," could be seen as a natural denial gesture, but it also feels like a deliberate effort to push the question away.

The smile they give is subtle and seems genuine at first glance, but when paired with a denial, it raises some suspicion. Sometimes people smile to appear relaxed when they’re actually trying to mask discomfort or conceal information. The way their head tilts could indicate genuine contemplation, but it might also suggest they're carefully crafting their response.

While the direct eye contact and steady demeanor would usually point towards truthfulness, the combination of that small, potentially polite smile and the shaking of the head leaves me leaning toward the possibility that they might be hiding something. It doesn’t feel like a blatant lie, but there’s enough subtle tension in their behavior to make me cautious about fully trusting their words. Without knowing the context or the question they’re responding to, it’s tough to be certain, but overall, I’d say there’s a reasonable chance this person could be being deceptive.

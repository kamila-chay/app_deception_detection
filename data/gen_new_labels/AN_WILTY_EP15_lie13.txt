Looking at the clip, I’m trying to piece this together, and while they maintain steady eye contact—which some say liars avoid—I'm starting to think that eye contact alone isn’t a reliable indicator. They’re shaking their head a few times and have their arms folded the whole time, which feels somewhat defensive. That posture often suggests someone is shutting down or feeling uneasy, which might hint that they aren’t fully open.

Of course, head shaking could simply mean disagreement rather than lying—like a straightforward denial. And folding arms can be a comfort gesture, not necessarily a sign of deception. There aren’t classic nervous signs like fidgeting, weird blinking, or lip biting, which might usually signal lying. But then again, some people can stay calm and composed even when being deceptive.

What stands out to me is that the consistent eye contact might be practiced, possibly a deliberate effort to appear truthful. Given the combination of defensive body language and the calm demeanor, I’m leaning toward the possibility that they might be hiding something or not being entirely truthful. It’s not conclusive, but overall, the cues lean me a bit more in the direction of deception than honesty.

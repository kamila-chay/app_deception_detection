This is a bit complicated, but when I watch this person speak, the fact that they avoid eye contact entirely—constantly looking down at their hands or the floor—stands out to me. While that alone isn’t definitive proof of lying, it is a behavior often linked to deception. They don’t show other classic signs of lying like fidgeting, unusual smiles, or hesitation, and they seem fairly calm without obvious nervousness. However, the persistent avoidance of eye contact feels unusual enough that it makes me lean slightly towards thinking they might not be truthful. Of course, some people naturally avoid eye contact or look down when they’re speaking, especially if they’re shy or concentrating, so it's not conclusive. Still, given the combination of behaviors and that one consistent cue, I’d say it’s more likely than not that there’s some level of deception involved, though I can’t be certain without hearing what they’re actually saying. Overall, I lean toward them possibly lying, but there’s enough ambiguity that it’s worth considering alternative explanations.

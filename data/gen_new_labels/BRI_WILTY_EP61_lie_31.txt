Looking at the clip, I'm leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. The most noticeable behavior is their repeated eyebrow raising—it's quite pronounced, as if they're trying to appear surprised or overly attentive. This kind of exaggerated expression can sometimes suggest stress or an attempt to feign innocence, which are often linked to deception. While they don't show other common signs like fidgeting, nervous smiling, or avoiding eye contact, the deliberate nature of the eyebrow lifts stands out. Although some people raise their eyebrows naturally when confused or processing information, the frequency and intensity here seem a bit too calculated for a simple reaction. Without knowing the context or what they're saying, it’s hard to be sure, but the eyebrow movement gives me a slight impression that they might be trying to mask something. Overall, I’m tentatively inclined to think there’s some deception involved, though I wouldn’t make a confident call without more information.

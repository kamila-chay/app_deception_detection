This one is quite ambiguous, but leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. While they do maintain eye contact and display a seemingly natural smile, which often suggests honesty, there are subtle cues that raise some doubts. The head shaking while smiling feels somewhat contradictory—people sometimes do that when they’re nervous or trying to downplay something, which can hint at deception. The raised eyebrows and upward gaze also stand out; although they can indicate genuine thought or surprise, they might also reflect stress or the mental effort of fabricating details. The palms-up gesture is generally a sign of openness, yet in the context of these other signals, it could be masking discomfort. Although they don’t show obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, these mixed signals together make me suspect they might be concealing something. It’s not a firm conclusion, but I’m inclined to think they’re more likely not telling the whole truth.

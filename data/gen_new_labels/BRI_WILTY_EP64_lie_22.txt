This is a bit tricky to call just from the video, but after watching the clip a few times, I’m leaning toward the person probably being deceptive. The laughter they showed during their response is interesting because while genuine laughter often indicates truthfulness, it can sometimes be used as a way to mask discomfort or cover up dishonesty. Although the laughter seemed spontaneous, it might actually be a tactic to appear more trustworthy.

Then there’s the eyebrow raising, which is somewhat ambiguous. People often raise their eyebrows when skeptical or nervous, and in this case, it could suggest some level of anxiety related to lying, even if it might also be a reaction to what was said. The absence of classic "lie signs" like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact is notable, but some people are very good at hiding those cues, so their calmness doesn’t necessarily rule out deception.

Considering all this, I’m inclined to think the behavior leans slightly more toward deception, although it’s not definitive. The laughter might have been an attempt to appear friendly or at ease, which can sometimes accompany lying. Without more context, it’s hard to be certain, but overall, I would lean toward suspecting that the person is probably not being entirely truthful.

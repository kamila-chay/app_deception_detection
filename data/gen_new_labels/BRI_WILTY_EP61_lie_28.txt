This is a bit tricky to judge based on the video alone, but there are some subtle reasons to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying. They appear very calm and composed—no fidgeting, no avoiding eye contact, and no nervous gestures like touching their face or excessive blinking. At first glance, this might suggest honesty, since they’re directly answering questions without obvious signs of stress. However, their smooth and relaxed demeanor could also indicate that they’re rehearsed or deliberately controlling their behavior to appear truthful.

The lack of typical “tells” associated with lying isn’t necessarily reassuring; some people who lie convincingly are extremely practiced at masking any signs of deceit. Their calmness, instead of seeming natural, might feel a little too perfect, as if they're overcompensating to seem honest. Since many traditional “tells” are often unreliable or more common in truth-tellers, the absence of these cues doesn’t rule out deception.

Without hearing their tone or the way they phrase things—only relying on body language—it’s hard to be certain. Yet, given how unusually composed they are, I tend to lean toward the possibility they might be hiding something, even though it’s not definitive. More context or a different setting would be needed for a clearer judgment, but for now, the impression is that they’re probably not being entirely truthful.

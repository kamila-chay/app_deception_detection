Watching this clip, I find myself leaning toward the person possibly being untruthful, though it's not a certainty. While they maintain steady eye contact and show no obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding gaze—behaviors often associated with lying—the frequent and intense eyebrow-raising feels unusual. It almost looks like they're trying to appear surprised or skeptical about what they're saying, which could be a subtle attempt to mask their discomfort or fabricate sincerity. 

Although steady eye contact usually suggests honesty, some liars are skilled at maintaining it to avoid suspicion. The lack of other nervous gestures doesn’t rule out deception entirely, especially since the raised eyebrows might indicate they're either overstimulating their expressions to seem genuine or are rehearsing their answers too carefully. Given the subdued atmosphere and absence of clear emotional cues like laughter or scowling, the situation feels a bit too controlled and cautious, which can be a sign of someone trying not to slip up.

All things considered, I can't say for sure, but the eyebrow behavior combined with the unnatural calmness makes me lean toward the idea that they might be concealing something. It’s subtle and could be explained other ways, but overall, my impression tips slightly in the direction of deception rather than full honesty.

Honestly, while it's still not entirely certain, there are some subtle cues that make me lean toward the possibility that this person might be lying. Their direct eye contact is interesting—it can sometimes suggest honesty, but in other cases, people maintain steady eye contact deliberately to appear more convincing when they’re not telling the truth. Additionally, their head moving backward slightly and the subtle head shaking, almost like a quiet "no" while speaking, feels a bit off. Raised eyebrows can indicate surprise or sincerity, but they can also signal nervousness or an attempt to feign openness. 

If they were completely comfortable telling the truth, I'd expect a more relaxed demeanor without those small, somewhat defensive motions. While these signs aren't definitive proof, combined they suggest some level of guardedness or discomfort that could align with deception. On the other hand, there's no obvious avoidance of eye contact, fidgeting, or overt nervous gestures, which you might expect from someone clearly trying to deceive. Still, given the subtle tension in their movements and the controlled stare, I’m inclined to think they might be holding something back. Without knowing the specifics of what’s being said, it's hard to be sure, but overall, I lean slightly toward deception rather than honesty.

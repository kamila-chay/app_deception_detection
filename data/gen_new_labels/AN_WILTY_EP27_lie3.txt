Looking at the video, I'm leaning toward the possibility that they're not being entirely truthful, though it's not definitive. While they maintain steady eye contact and nod as they speak—signs that usually suggest honesty—the subtle chin movement, a slight up-and-down motion, caught my attention. Some sources associate this kind of behavior with stress or attempts to appear calm when deceiving, even if it could also be a harmless habit. They don't show overt signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which complicates things, but this chin movement feels like a small, uneasy cue that shouldn't be ignored. Without knowing the context of their words, it’s hard to make a firm judgment, but overall, I find myself leaning slightly toward the idea that there might be some deception here. It’s not a clear-cut case, but the combination of subtle signals suggests they could be hiding something.

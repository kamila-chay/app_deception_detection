Looking at the clip, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that they might be lying, although it’s not entirely certain. They maintain a lot of eye contact, which usually suggests honesty, since people who lie tend to avoid looking at others. Their open arm posture also gives off a vibe of sincerity or approachability, which isn’t what I’d expect if they were being deceptive. 

However, the way their gaze shifts frequently—looking down and to the sides multiple times—raises some doubts. That kind of behavior can be a sign of discomfort or someone trying to avoid fully facing the truth. The lack of smiling or natural expressions, paired with a rather stiff demeanor, is also somewhat suspicious, as it can indicate someone controlling their facial expressions to hide something.

It’s possible they’re just nervous or reserved, which could explain the gaze shifts without any deception. Still, considering the combination of open arms with those odd gaze patterns and the stiff expression, I’m inclined to think they might not be telling the whole truth. It’s not a definitive judgment, but overall, I lean more toward deception than honesty based on these cues.

Watching the video, the person maintains steady eye contact without looking away, which at first glance might suggest honesty since people who lie often avert their gaze. However, this very unwavering eye contact feels somewhat forced, as if they’re trying too hard to appear truthful. They also raise their eyebrows a couple of times in a way that seems almost rehearsed, and then they close their eyes tightly for a bit longer than a natural blink—an exaggerated gesture that could indicate discomfort or an attempt to hide something.  

While they don’t display typical signs of lying like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or nervous gestures, it’s worth noting that some individuals who deceive are incredibly composed, making the absence of those signs less reassuring. The odd eyebrow movements and prolonged eye-closing stand out as possible giveaways that they might be overcompensating to appear innocent.  

Overall, although the direct eye contact suggests truthfulness on the surface, these peculiar behaviors hint that the person could be masking their deception. I wouldn’t be too confident either way, but I tend to lean toward thinking they might not be entirely truthful in this moment.

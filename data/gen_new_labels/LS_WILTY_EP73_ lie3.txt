Watching the clip, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that the person might actually be lying, even if it's not obvious at first. They don’t show the usual telltale signs like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or hesitating awkwardly, which makes them seem calm and composed. However, that calmness itself feels somewhat suspicious—sometimes people who lie convincingly are just very good at hiding it, and a lack of nervousness can be a sign of practiced deception rather than honesty.

One subtle cue is the frequent raising of their eyebrows. While this could just mean they’re processing the question or genuinely surprised, it might also be an unconscious attempt to appear more sincere. Some research suggests that involuntary eyebrow movements can be tied to deception, though it's not a definitive signal on its own.

The absence of typical nervous behaviors makes it tricky to label their honesty confidently, but the overly calm demeanor paired with these eyebrow movements makes me doubt their truthfulness slightly. It could be that the lie is so well-rehearsed it comes across as natural, or perhaps they're consciously controlling their reactions to avoid detection. Without more information or follow-up questions, it’s hard to be sure, but based on these observations, I’m more inclined to suspect that they might not be fully truthful.

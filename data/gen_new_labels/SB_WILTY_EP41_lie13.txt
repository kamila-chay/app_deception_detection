Looking at this clip, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful, though I’m not fully certain. The way they consistently look down rather than making eye contact strikes me as unusual; in a typical conversation, some natural eye contact would be expected. Their head movements—pulling slightly backward and turning sideways—seem like attempts to put some distance between themselves and the interaction, which can be a subtle sign of discomfort or avoidance. The way they lift their chin a bit, as if trying to stabilize their head, also suggests they might be overcompensating.

That said, it’s important to remain cautious. These behaviors can also be explained by factors unrelated to deceit, such as tiredness, cultural differences regarding eye contact, or simply a thoughtful or fidgety nature. The absence of more obvious signs like nervous laughter or extreme avoidance makes the case less clear, and it’s not as if their gaze is completely averted. Still, the combination of these cues, particularly the downward gaze paired with movements that create distance, does lean toward a possibility that something is being concealed. Without knowing the context or more about the person, it’s tough to be sure, but overall, I’m inclined to suspect they might be bending the truth, even if I can’t say so definitively.

This is a bit complicated, but watching the clip, the person comes across as somewhat tense. Their eyebrows are doing something unusual—partly furrowed yet also raised, which suggests confusion or intense concentration. They're blinking a lot more than usual, almost constantly. Their lips are downturned, not smiling, which feels odd if they're simply answering a straightforward question. They also tilt their head while speaking, a gesture often seen when someone is searching for the right words.

Some of these signs—frequent blinking and the conflicting eyebrow movements—could be classic indicators of discomfort or possibly an attempt to hide something. Interestingly, they maintain eye contact rather than avoiding it, which might explain the excessive blinking, as if they're forcing themselves to stay engaged despite nervousness. The downward pull of their lips seems to reveal stress or unease about the topic.

On the flip side, it's also possible these behaviors are just natural expressions. Some people tend to raise their eyebrows when thinking and blink more when tired or focused. The head tilt might simply be a habitual way of processing information rather than a sign of deception. Maintaining eye contact while exhibiting these signs is contradictory to common lying stereotypes, where avoiding eye contact is expected.

I can’t be certain—there’s no definitive proof here, as nervousness and lying can appear quite similar. Perhaps they are just uncomfortable or frustrated with the question. However, the combination of the frown, excessive blinking, and downturned lips suggests something might be off. It seems like they are trying to appear calm, but their body language isn’t quite matching up. Overall, while it’s not conclusive, I lean toward thinking they might not be fully truthful, though I wouldn’t say it’s a guarantee.

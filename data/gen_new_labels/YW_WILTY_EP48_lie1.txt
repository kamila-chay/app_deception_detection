Based on the clip, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though I can’t be entirely sure. They maintain direct eye contact throughout, which contradicts the common idea that liars avoid looking at someone. However, some people do the opposite, trying to appear overly honest by holding steady eye contact, which feels a bit unnatural here. Their eyes don’t shift much, which seems unusual for someone who is genuinely relaxed. There’s also this small, subtle smile—not a warm, genuine one, but more like a forced attempt to appear friendly. Additionally, the person’s chin dips down a few times, a gesture I’ve noticed in people who are nervous or concealing something. It’s slight but notable. 

That said, I can’t rule out that this might just be how they naturally behave. The direct gaze might indicate confidence and truthfulness rather than deception. The smile could simply be their calm, default expression, and their lack of fidgeting or excessive blinking doesn’t align with typical signs of lying. People can lie flawlessly without obvious cues, so there’s a chance they’re just good at hiding it. 

It’s a tricky judgment overall. The combination of steady eye contact, the faint forced smile, and the chin movement leans me toward thinking they’re probably not being entirely truthful, but I wouldn’t put too much confidence in that conclusion. Without more context, it’s just a cautious suspicion rather than a firm assertion.

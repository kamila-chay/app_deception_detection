Looking at the video, I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. The persistent frown and the way their eyebrows are pulled down tight could indicate genuine frustration, but it might also be an attempt to appear serious and credible, possibly masking deceit. The sideways glances stand out as well—they could be innocent moments of distraction or nervousness, but they also suggest a possible effort to avoid direct eye contact, a common behavior when someone is trying to conceal the truth. 

While the person does maintain some eye contact and appears calm, which typically points toward honesty, that calmness might be deliberate control to hide nervousness or discomfort associated with lying. It’s notable that there aren’t classic signs like lip biting or excessive blinking, but sometimes people who are skilled at deception can suppress those obvious tells. The stillness combined with a serious expression could be a way to project confidence and deflect suspicion rather than genuine openness.

I’m not fully convinced either way, but given the mix of subtle cues—the persistent frown, the sideways glances, and the controlled composure—I tend to lean toward the possibility that the person is being deceptive. It’s not definitive, but these signs together raise enough doubt to question their truthfulness.

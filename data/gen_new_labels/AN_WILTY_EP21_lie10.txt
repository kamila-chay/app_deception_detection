Trying to decide just from the video is challenging, but leaning toward deception seems more reasonable here. The person maintains really steady eye contact, which often suggests honesty, but it almost feels a bit too deliberate, like they’re consciously trying to appear sincere. The frequent eyebrow raises come off less like genuine surprise and more like a rehearsed expression, as if they’re reacting to the question in a way that’s meant to deflect suspicion rather than show true emotion. 

Their consistent nodding also feels somewhat staged—too controlled and uniform to be a natural response, as if they’re carefully managing their body language. Typically, someone telling the truth might show more subtle, relaxed variations in expression that suggest they’re at ease, but this person seems focused on maintaining a specific facade. 

They don’t display classic nervous signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which could argue for honesty, but expert deceivers often suppress these very cues and may even overcompensate with strong eye contact to seem credible. Given these factors, while it’s not certain, it does seem more likely they might be hiding something. The lack of clear nervousness combined with somewhat mechanical facial cues leans me toward suspecting they are probably not being completely truthful—even if I can’t say that with full confidence.

Based on what I’m observing in the video, I’m somewhat inclined to think they might be lying, though it’s not entirely certain. There are several cues that suggest deception, like the frequent frowning with eyebrows pulled down, the clear head shake signaling “no,” and the upward shrug as if distancing themselves from responsibility. Their eyes frequently looking down rather than meeting the other person’s gaze is another indicator often associated with nervousness or avoidance during lying. However, these same behaviors—looking away, frowning, and shrugging—could also simply reflect genuine confusion, frustration, or distress about the situation. The head shake might not definitively mean they’re lying; sometimes people do this when they disagree rather than when they’re being untruthful. With no knowledge of the exact questions or context, it’s challenging to be sure. Still, the combination of the head shaking, downward gaze, and defensive shrug makes me lean slightly toward deception, even if it’s possible they’re honestly upset or overwhelmed. I wouldn’t say this is a sure thing, but my gut feeling leans more toward them not being entirely truthful.

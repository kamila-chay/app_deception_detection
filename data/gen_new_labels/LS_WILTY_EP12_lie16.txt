Honestly, I'm not entirely certain, but after watching the clip several times, some things make me lean toward the person possibly not being truthful. The frequent blinking and the way their eyes are opened wide seem a bit forced, almost as if they're trying too hard to appear engaged or sincere. The slight, incomplete smile feels more like a nervous gesture than a genuine expression, which could indicate discomfort or deceit.

While it’s true they maintain steady eye contact, which is often thought to suggest honesty, that alone doesn’t fully convince me. Some people who lie can overcompensate by holding strong eye contact to appear more credible. Their head movements and the subtle shaking of the head could be nervous reactions to fabricating or hiding something, rather than straightforward responses.

The combination of these signs—the forced engagement, the nervous smile, and the blinking—makes me suspect that there might be some deception involved. I wouldn’t say it’s certain, but my impression leans more toward the possibility that they aren’t being completely honest, even if it’s hard to be definitive without hearing what they’re actually saying or knowing the full context.

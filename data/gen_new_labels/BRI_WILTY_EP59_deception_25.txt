Watching the clip, I'm starting to lean toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful. They exhibit several signs commonly associated with deception, like raising their eyebrows a lot and blinking excessively, which can indicate stress or discomfort. The sideways glances stand out as well; people often look away when trying to hide something or keep their story straight, and that's something I've observed in other instances of dishonesty.

While they do maintain eye contact most of the time, which could suggest honesty, this alone isn't enough to outweigh the other cues. It's possible that the eye contact is a deliberate attempt to appear sincere or to mask the lie. Frequent blinking might be caused by nervousness, but in combination with the other signals, it raises some suspicion rather than dispels it. I acknowledge that nervousness could simply come from being on camera, but the overall pattern of behavior tilts in the direction of deception more than truthfulness. Without additional context or information, I can't be certain, but I find myself leaning toward the likelihood that they are not fully honest here.

This one feels a bit ambiguous, but I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. Their frequent head movements—tilting, turning sideways, shifting forward and back—seem a bit restless, almost like nervous energy rather than natural expressiveness. The raised eyebrows, while consistent, combined with those sideways glances that interrupt mostly steady eye contact, strike me as unusual. It’s not the classic pattern of outright avoiding eye contact, but it might suggest they’re trying to manage their reactions or search for cues from the other person, which can happen when someone is being deceptive.

That said, I can’t completely rule out that some people naturally move their heads a lot or raise their eyebrows out of genuine surprise or thoughtfulness. The absence of more obvious deception signs—like frowning, awkward pauses, or consistent eye avoidance—keeps me from being fully convinced. Still, the way they seem to be adjusting their posture repeatedly, almost as if trying to appear more relaxed, together with the sideways glancing, feels like a subtle attempt to mask discomfort or uncertainty.

Overall, while the presence of mostly steady eye contact might suggest honesty, the combination of those other cues nudges me to lean more toward the possibility that they’re not telling the full truth. I wouldn’t say it’s a certainty, but right now, I’d tentatively suspect some level of deception.

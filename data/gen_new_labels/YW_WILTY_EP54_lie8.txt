While I can't be completely certain, there are a few subtle signs that make me lean toward thinking this person might be lying. Their laughter during what seems to be a serious conversation feels somewhat out of place, as if it's a bit forced or used to deflect tension. The repeated head shaking "no" also seems slightly exaggerated, which could suggest they’re emphasizing their disagreement beyond just a simple difference of opinion. Although their palms-up gesture usually signals sincerity, it can sometimes be employed to appear honest when someone is actually hiding something.

On the other hand, their steady eye contact and raised eyebrows often indicate truthfulness or at least genuine confusion, which complicates the interpretation. The head shaking might just be a habitual response, and the laughter could be nervousness rather than deception. However, the mismatch between the laughter and the tense mood stands out as the most telling detail.

So overall, while I wouldn’t say it’s definitive, I do tend to suspect some level of deception here. The combination of the awkward laughter and the somewhat exaggerated nonverbal cues pushes me in that direction, even though I’d need more context to be more certain.

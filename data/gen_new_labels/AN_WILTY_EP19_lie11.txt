Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might not be entirely truthful. While they do maintain consistent eye contact and lean in slightly—which often suggests engagement and sincerity—there are some subtle signals that give me pause. Their chin keeps lifting in a way that could indicate defensiveness or an attempt to appear more confident than they actually feel. More notably, they’re crossing their fingers quietly and almost unconsciously, which is a classic nervous habit and sometimes a sign of hoping to ‘cover’ what they’re saying.

It’s true that the chin movement might just be a natural gesture, and finger-crossing could be a harmless tic or a way to manage nervous energy. Plus, they aren’t avoiding eye contact or exhibiting other typical signs of lying like increased blinking or facial tension, which could suggest they’re not outright lying. However, that subtle finger crossing feels a bit out of place amid their otherwise calm demeanor, and that discrepancy makes me suspicious.

Without additional context or knowing the stakes of the conversation, I can’t say for certain. The cues don’t definitively prove deception, but on balance, they tilt me toward thinking the person may be a bit guarded or not entirely forthcoming. I’m not fully confident in labeling it as a lie, but I do lean toward some level of deception based on these mixed signals.

Based on the video, while I can't be completely certain, there are several cues that make me lean toward the person not being entirely truthful. For instance, although they nod while speaking, which typically signals agreement, their gaze flickers sideways rather than staying steady on the person they're addressing. This avoidance of consistent eye contact often aligns with evasiveness, which can be a subtle sign of deception. 

Their facial expressions add to this impression. The furrowed eyebrows combined with a strange mix of a smile and frown—where their lips are both pulled up and down and puckered—seem tense and somewhat unnatural. This kind of controlling of facial muscles, which sometimes slips through, is something I've noticed before when people are nervous about hiding something, though it could also stem from general anxiety.

On the other hand, some behaviors could just reflect stress or discomfort rather than dishonesty. The slight head movement backward and side turn might be habitual thinking gestures, and they do look at the other person at times, possibly to appear sincere. The lack of more obvious signs like excessive blinking or hand fidgeting also makes it harder to say definitively.

Overall, while it's still difficult to be sure given the mixed signals, the sideways glances and awkward facial expressions suggest to me that they might be leaning toward deception. I wouldn't say this with absolute confidence, but I do find it more likely than not—probably around a 60% chance that they're not being completely honest—though nervousness could easily explain the behavior as well.

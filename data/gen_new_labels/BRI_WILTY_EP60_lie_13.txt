Looking at this clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t say for certain. While they maintain pretty consistent eye contact, which often suggests honesty, the subtle eyebrow raises feel a bit off. That kind of slight lift can happen when someone is processing something tricky, but it can also be a sign of preparing a false answer. The fact that their eyes flick sideways briefly before returning to the interviewer is another detail that raises some suspicion. That sideways glance is often linked to people trying to construct or modify a response, rather than simply recalling information.

They don’t show the more obvious signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, which complicates things. It’s possible they’ve practiced controlling those typical tells, making the eyebrow raise and eye movement more notable. While moments like these could stem from genuine surprise or concentration, the combination of these subtle cues tends to lean toward some level of deception in my view. Without context, it’s hard to be sure, but overall, I find myself more inclined to suspect the person isn’t being fully truthful.

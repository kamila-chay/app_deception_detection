This situation feels a bit more suspicious than straightforward at first glance. The person's raised eyebrows might suggest surprise, but paired with the repeated head tilting and shaking "no," it creates a somewhat inconsistent picture that leans toward evasion. The mix of gestures—like leaning forward with arms wide open—could be an attempt to appear open and honest, but in this context, it comes across as slightly unnatural or forced, which can sometimes be a subtle indicator of deception.

While it's true that raised eyebrows and head tilting can simply indicate thoughtfulness or confusion, the combination with the head-shaking "no" seems to suggest they might be dismissing something more than just processing information. It's notable that they're not showing classic signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting with their hands, which keeps this from being a clear-cut case. Yet the overall behavior feels a little too deliberate or rehearsed, making me lean toward the idea that they might not be fully truthful.

I wouldn’t say this is definitive proof—there’s still room for doubt, and they could just be nervous or trying to be friendly on camera. However, given the subtle inconsistencies in their body language, my impression is that there's a reasonable chance they are not being completely honest here. So while I can't state it with full confidence, I do lean toward the possibility that they are leaning toward deception.

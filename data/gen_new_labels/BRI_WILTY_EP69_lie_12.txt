This is a bit tricky, but based on what I’m seeing, I’m leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying. They appear generally calm, without the classic signs like fidgeting or forced smiles, and they maintain consistent eye contact, which isn’t typical of many liars. However, the frequent raising of their eyebrows is quite noticeable and could indicate some level of stress or an attempt to appear more convincing. Their eyes drifting sideways instead of holding steady gaze also seems unusual and might suggest discomfort or distraction linked to deception.

While it’s true that people sometimes raise their eyebrows naturally when concentrating or trying to sound sincere, and that sideways glances could just be about processing thoughts or looking away momentarily, these subtle cues combined with their expressive gestures raise some doubt. The absence of other nervous behaviors such as rapid blinking, lip biting, or awkward silences does complicate the picture, making it less clear cut.

Given these mixed signals, I’m inclined to think there’s a chance the person might not be fully truthful, though it’s far from certain. Without knowing what they’re actually saying, it’s hard to be definitive, but the eyebrow movements and gaze shifts make me lean a bit toward deception rather than honesty.

This is a bit difficult to judge solely from the video, but I find myself leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying. They maintain direct eye contact throughout, which typically suggests truthfulness since people who lie often glance away. However, the way they repeatedly raise their eyebrows—almost exaggeratedly—strikes me as potentially an attempt to appear surprised or innocent, which could be a subtle sign of overcompensation. Additionally, their shrugging while speaking feels somewhat off; shrugs often convey uncertainty or deflection, and combined with the heightened eyebrows, it might indicate they're trying too hard to seem casual or unaware.

On the flip side, there are no signs of typical nervousness like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or touching their face, which usually accompany deceptive behavior. This absence makes it possible they could be genuine, or simply habitually expressive with their eyebrows and gestures. The context is missing, so it’s hard to say definitively.

Still, the mixture of unwavering eye contact and those somewhat suspicious facial cues makes me inclined to suspect they might not be fully truthful. It’s not a certainty, and there are plausible alternative explanations, but overall, the subtle signs give me reason to lean toward the possibility of deception.

Looking at the clip, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I’m not entirely certain. The frequent nodding combined with raised eyebrows catches my attention—especially since there’s no accompanying smile or frown, which one might expect if they were genuinely engaged or emotional. The sideways glances they keep throwing feel somewhat off, as if they’re avoiding full eye contact with the other person. That behavior is often linked to deception, even if it can sometimes be explained by nerves or unfamiliarity with being recorded.

What also gives me pause is how calm and composed they appear otherwise—no fidgeting, lip biting, or awkward pauses. Usually, someone lying might show more nervous habits, like darting eyes or restless movements, but here they’re quite still aside from the eyebrow raises and head tilts. Still, those eyebrow raises might indicate they’re thinking hard or trying to come up with a response, which could go either way.

However, the sideways glances seem more suspicious than just casual thinking; it’s as if they’re looking away to piece together a story. Although some individuals naturally avoid direct eye contact, combined with the other subtle cues, I find myself leaning more toward the possibility that they aren’t being fully truthful. The absence of classic lie signs like fake smiles or excessive blinking doesn’t entirely rule out deception, especially since people can lie without displaying all those behaviors. Without more context, it’s tough to say for sure, but overall, I tend to suspect that they might be deceiving rather than entirely honest.

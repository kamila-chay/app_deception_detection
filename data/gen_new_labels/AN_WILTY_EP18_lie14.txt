Honestly, while the person appears calm and composed, there are some reasons to lean toward the possibility that they might be lying. Their steady eye contact and open palms typically suggest honesty, but these same behaviors can also be used deliberately to create the appearance of truthfulness. Sometimes, liars overcompensate by maintaining intense eye contact or making gestures that seem designed to signal openness. The absence of classic nervous behaviors like fidgeting or awkward pauses doesn't necessarily mean they're truthful; some skilled deceivers can appear surprisingly relaxed. In fact, the very lack of stress cues here might be a subtle sign of practiced deception rather than innocence. Though the overall vibe feels natural, it’s hard not to wonder if this calmness is a mask. Without more context, it’s difficult to be certain, but based on these observations, I tend to lean toward thinking the person might not be entirely truthful.

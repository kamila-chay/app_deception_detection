This is a bit tricky to interpret, but leaning toward the person possibly not being entirely truthful. They maintain steady eye contact and nod along, which typically suggests sincerity, and they don’t display many classic signs of nervousness like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact. However, the raised eyebrows stand out—while subtle, this expression could be an involuntary cue hinting at some uncertainty or discomfort. It might be an attempt to appear open or surprised, but the lack of a genuine smile or relaxed expression complicates that interpretation. 

The consistent nodding while maintaining eye contact might suggest agreement, but it’s worth considering that some people who lie deliberately overcompensate by appearing overly engaged. Eye contact, after all, isn’t a foolproof indicator. Taking all these nuances into account, while there are reasons to believe they could be honest, the eyebrow movement and slightly stiff demeanor make me lean more toward the possibility they might be hiding something. Without more context, it’s hard to be certain, but the subtle cues suggest there’s a reasonable chance they’re not being fully truthful.

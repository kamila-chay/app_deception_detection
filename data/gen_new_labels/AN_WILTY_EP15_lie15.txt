Honestly, based on what I’m seeing in the video, I’m leaning toward the person possibly being deceptive, though it’s not entirely clear. They’re making consistent eye contact, which some might interpret as a sign of honesty, but it also strikes me as potentially forced—like they’re trying *too* hard to convince. At the same time, their arms are folded the whole time, which can indicate defensiveness or discomfort, and that raises some suspicion. While liars don’t always avoid eye contact, intense eye contact combined with closed-off body language could be a tactic to mask dishonesty.

On the other hand, they don’t show other classic signs of nervousness—no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, no fake smiles or laughing—which complicates the picture. Usually, if someone is lying, I'd expect to see at least one subtle nervous gesture, like touching their face or hesitating, but none of that is present. It’s possible they’re just naturally reserved or comfortable, and the folded arms might be a habitual posture rather than a red flag.

Still, the absence of these typical tells doesn’t fully reassure me. Some people who lie are quite skilled at maintaining a calm demeanor and steady eye contact while using a defensive posture, so I can’t rule out deception entirely. Overall, I lean toward thinking they might be lying, given the mixed signals and those subtle cues of discomfort, but it’s not certain. Without additional context, I’d hesitate to be definitive, though my instinct is to question their honesty.

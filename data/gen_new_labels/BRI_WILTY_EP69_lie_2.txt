This is somewhat difficult to determine just by watching, but there are a few cues that make me lean toward the person possibly not being entirely truthful. They mostly look at the person they're speaking to, which suggests engagement, but they also keep glancing sideways. That sideways glance strikes me as a bit unusual—it's not a full avoidance of eye contact but a quick flicker away, which can sometimes indicate someone is trying to appear attentive while feeling uneasy or hiding something. This kind of subtle shift in gaze could hint at deception.

At the same time, the person doesn't display many of the typical nervous behaviors—no excessive blinking, no fidgeting, no awkward pauses, and no forced facial expressions. Their composure might suggest honesty or simply that they're experienced at hiding any signs of dishonesty. Since practiced liars often show fewer obvious tells, this calmness could potentially support the idea they might be concealing something.

On the other hand, the sideways glance might just be a thinking habit, a way of processing information, rather than a sign of deceit. The fact that they mostly maintain eye contact leans slightly toward honesty, considering that many liars tend to avoid eye contact more consistently, although some overcompensate by staring too intently, which complicates the interpretation.

Putting it all together, while the behavior is ambiguous, the combination of the subtle side glances coupled with a lack of other nervous cues makes me incline toward the possibility that they might be less than fully truthful. It’s not definitive, and they could just be distracted or thoughtful, but if I had to choose, I’d tentatively suspect some level of deception. More context or additional interaction would be needed to be more certain.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, the person appears very calm and composed while speaking—as if they’re simply explaining something straightforward. They don’t fidget, avoid eye contact, or show obvious signs of nervousness. Their face stays neutral without big smiles or frowns, and they’re not touching their face or rubbing their hands. On the surface, it’s hard to spot any signs of discomfort or hesitation. However, this very calmness could be a bit of a red flag. While many people who lie do show some kind of nervous tic, even subtle, some of the most convincing liars manage to stay perfectly composed, making their lack of reaction suspicious in itself. The video doesn’t offer much else—no awkward pauses or shifting eyes—so it doesn’t scream "lying," but the absence of usual stress cues might mean the person is hiding something. Given these observations, I lean toward the idea that they might be deceiving, though it’s not certain. Without more context or any sign of tension, it’s difficult to be confident, but the calmness here raises enough questions to consider deception as a likely possibility.

Honestly, it's a bit tricky to be certain just from watching, but there are some cues that make me lean toward thinking they might be lying. For instance, they were laughing a lot during the conversation—on the surface, it seemed genuine and relaxed, which would usually suggest truthfulness. However, they repeatedly crossed their fingers subtly behind their back or at their side, which is often a sign people use when they’re trying to "promise" something they might not fully believe themselves. That small gesture makes me question whether the laughter was entirely natural or possibly a cover-up to mask the nervousness behind those crossed fingers.

At the same time, they maintained steady eye contact throughout, which typically indicates honesty because liars often avoid direct gaze. The laughter matched the flow of the conversation nicely, so it might have been genuine after all. Plus, the finger crossing could have a perfectly innocent explanation, like a personal habit or a quiet hope for the conversation to go well.

Still, the finger crossing stands out as a significant clue that nudges me toward suspicion. While the eye contact and laughter pull in the opposite direction, the overall impression is that they may be trying a bit too hard to appear sincere. So, although I can't say they definitely lied, I tend to lean toward thinking there’s some level of deception here—not confidently, but enough to make me skeptical. If I had the chance to observe more closely or see additional behavior, I’d watch for other subtle signs to confirm one way or the other.

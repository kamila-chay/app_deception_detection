Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, though not with complete certainty. They maintain steady eye contact, which could suggest honesty, but the way they keep their eyes wide open seems a bit exaggerated, almost as if they’re trying to appear especially innocent or surprised. This kind of forced expression can sometimes be a sign of someone trying too hard to sell a story. The subtle finger-crossing under the table is another detail that stands out; while it’s easy to think it might just be a nervous habit, it’s also known as a subconscious gesture people use when they’re not entirely truthful, like a silent plea for luck or a way to ward off guilt.

It’s true that some people naturally have expressive eyes or fidget quietly when they’re anxious or tired, so these signs are not definitive proof. The consistent eye contact is somewhat unusual for a liar, who might typically avoid looking at the listener directly. Still, those two unusual cues—the exaggerated eye movements and the hidden finger-crossing—make me suspicious. They don’t scream deception, but they hint that the person might be hiding something or at least feeling uneasy about the truth. Overall, I’d cautiously lean toward the possibility that they are not fully truthful, even though more context would be needed to say anything more confidently.

Honestly, I'm not completely certain, but I'll share what I'm noticing. The person maintains steady eye contact throughout, which often suggests honesty since many people tend to avoid eye contact when lying. However, there's this one detail that stands out: they keep raising their eyebrows in a very noticeable way. It's not tied to any clear emotion like happiness or confusion—just a sharp, repeated eyebrow lift. I've heard that can sometimes indicate deception, as if they're trying to appear surprised or are mentally fabricating something. While it's true some people might do that when they're genuinely processing information or confused, the prominence of the eyebrow movement here makes me pause.

Other than that, they don't display classic signs of nervousness like avoiding eye contact, fidgeting, or lip biting. They seem calm and focused on the person they're speaking to, which would typically lean toward truthfulness. Yet, the eyebrow behavior seems a bit off—maybe it's a natural habit, or, possibly, it's a subtle way to cover something up.

Given all this, I'm somewhat torn. The eye contact leans toward honesty, but the eyebrow movement makes me suspect there might be more going on beneath the surface. So, if I had to lean one way, I'd say it's more probable they're not being entirely truthful, but I wouldn't be very confident in that assessment. Context would really help clarify things, and I could easily be misreading these signals.

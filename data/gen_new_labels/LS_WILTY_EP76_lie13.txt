Looking at this clip, I lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I wouldn't say it's certain. Their face appears quite tense, with a noticeable frown—eyebrows pulled down and the corners of their mouth turned down, showing no hint of a smile. That alone could suggest discomfort or stress, but combined with their steady, somewhat excessive nodding while answering, it starts to feel a bit off. Often, people who are deceptive overuse nodding to try and appear more convincing or sincere, and this nodding didn't come across as natural to me.

Still, it’s possible the frown and downturned lips simply reflect frustration or unease about the topic, rather than dishonesty. Some might just tense up or try to hold back their emotions in awkward or uncomfortable situations. The nodding could be a habitual or polite response, not necessarily a deceptive one—people nod all the time when they want to show they're engaged or agreeable, even if they're not feeling that way internally.

What makes me lean toward suspicion, though, is that this combination—the tense, closed-off facial expression paired with persistent nodding—feels inconsistent. If they were being truthful, I might expect a more neutral or relaxed face alongside the nods, not one that seems so guarded. There aren't clear signs like avoiding eye contact or fidgeting, which makes it less obvious, but this mismatch raises some doubts. Given all that, while I’m not completely convinced, I do tend to think they might be less than truthful here, even if I can’t say so with confidence. More context would definitely help clarify things.

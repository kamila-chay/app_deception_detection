Based on the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that the person might be lying, although it’s not entirely clear. Their raised eyebrows could suggest surprise or confusion, but in the context of the other behaviors, it might be a subtle cue of discomfort linked to deception. The frequent blinking seems like nervous energy, which can indicate stress from lying, even if sometimes it’s just tiredness or camera anxiety. More telling is their tendency to avoid direct eye contact by looking sideways and tilting their head away, actions often associated with trying to distance oneself when being untruthful. While these movements could simply reflect unease or unfamiliarity with being filmed, when combined they raise some suspicion. 

On the other hand, the absence of exaggerated gestures—like forced smiles or overcompensation—makes the situation less clear-cut. Their mostly neutral expression could suggest honesty, or it could be a deliberate attempt to stay calm and avoid giving away too much. Since these cues commonly appear during general stress or discomfort as well, it’s difficult to be certain. Without knowing the full context or the content of what they’re saying, I can’t definitively say they’re lying. However, based on the subtle signs of avoidance and nervousness, I do lean towards the possibility that they might not be telling the whole truth.

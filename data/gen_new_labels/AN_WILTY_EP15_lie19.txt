Honestly, while the person is maintaining consistent eye contact and nodding in a way that suggests engagement, which often signals honesty, the clear finger-crossing is a bit hard to ignore. This gesture can sometimes indicate someone trying to mask their true feelings or hoping to "undo" what they've said, which might hint at deception. Although it could simply be a nervous habit or a superstitious quirk, the presence of this subtle cue alongside otherwise calm behavior makes me lean slightly toward the possibility that they might not be entirely truthful. It's not definitive, and they could very well be honest, but that finger-crossing raises enough doubt that I tend to suspect some level of deception.

Based on the behavior I’m observing in the video, I’m inclined to think the person might be lying, though I’m not completely certain. The repeated raising of their eyebrows while answering seems somewhat forced, as if they’re trying too hard to appear surprised or to affirm something. Additionally, the sideways glance they frequently cast, even while maintaining partial eye contact, strikes me as inconsistent and a possible sign of discomfort or evasiveness, which often accompanies dishonesty. Their nodding also feels exaggerated, as if they’re overemphasizing agreement to appear cooperative.

That said, they do maintain direct eye contact most of the time, which generally suggests honesty, and they don’t exhibit common nervous behaviors like fidgeting, lip biting, or avoiding eye contact altogether. The eyebrow movements might just be a natural part of their expressiveness or a genuine reaction to the question. The sideways glance could simply indicate distraction rather than deception. The absence of more obvious signs of lying, such as sweating or full avoidance of eye contact, makes the situation less clear.

Ultimately, while I can’t say for sure, the combination of these subtle cues makes me lean toward the possibility that the person might be deceptive. It’s not a definitive conclusion, but those particular facial expressions and gaze shifts raise enough suspicion to doubt their complete honesty. Without more context or the actual conversation, I’d approach their statement with caution and skepticism.

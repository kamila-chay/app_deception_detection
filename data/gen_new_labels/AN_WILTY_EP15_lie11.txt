Honestly, while I can’t be entirely certain, I tend to lean more toward the idea that they might be lying. The main thing that catches my attention is how they’re looking down while still facing the person they’re talking to—this partial avoidance of eye contact could suggest discomfort or a desire to conceal something. Although people do sometimes look down when they’re thinking or feeling shy, it’s also a behavior often associated with deception. 

What complicates things is that there aren’t many other clear signs of lying such as nervous blinking, fidgeting, fake smiles, or awkward pauses. They seem relatively calm and composed, which could point toward honesty or simply someone who’s good at hiding their stress. However, the deliberate downward gaze feels a bit suspicious, as if they’re trying to avoid direct scrutiny.

While the absence of typical stress indicators makes me hesitate, I can’t ignore that the gaze behavior might hint at some level of dishonesty. It could be a reserved mannerism, but given the context, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they may not be telling the full truth. Without more context or information about their words and the situation, it’s hard to be definitive, but overall, I’m inclined to think there’s a possibility they’re not being entirely honest.

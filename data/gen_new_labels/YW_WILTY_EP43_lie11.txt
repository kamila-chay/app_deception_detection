Looking at the clip, I’m leaning toward the idea that they might be lying, though it’s not entirely clear. While they maintain consistent eye contact and show palms up, which can suggest openness, some of their other expressions feel off. The exaggerated eye opening and raised eyebrows strike me as overly intense for a normal conversation, almost like an attempt to overcompensate and appear convincing. The smile, although present, doesn’t come across as warm or genuine but rather forced, which raises some suspicion.

It’s possible they’re just animated or surprised, and the gestures could be natural, but the overall impression makes me lean toward deception. The absence of classic signs like avoiding eye contact doesn’t necessarily mean they’re truthful, since some liars can be very composed. So, while the cues aren’t definitive, I find myself gently inclined to think they might not be completely honest here. More context would be helpful, but based on what I’m seeing, I’d say there’s a decent chance they’re not telling the truth.

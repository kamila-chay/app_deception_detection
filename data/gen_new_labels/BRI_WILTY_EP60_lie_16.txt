After watching the clip a few times, I’m starting to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, though I can’t say for certain. The calm demeanor and steady eye contact stand out because usually, when someone is lying, they might avoid eye contact or show nervousness, but here they seem almost too composed. That level of calmness could suggest they are practiced at hiding something rather than simply being truthful.

The persistent frown with tightly knit eyebrows is also notable. While it could indicate frustration or stress unrelated to lying, it might also be a subtle, subconscious signal of discomfort with the truth. The lack of other nervous cues like fidgeting or awkward pauses doesn’t necessarily confirm honesty—it might just mean they are deliberately controlling their behavior to appear truthful.

Although steady eye contact often aligns with truth-telling, it can also be a tactic used when someone is trying hard to convince others of their sincerity. Given these mixed signals—the unusually calm composure, the tight frown, and the steady gaze—I find it more plausible that the person is not being entirely truthful, even if it’s not definitive. Without more context about the question they’re answering, it’s difficult to be sure, but overall, I lean toward deception based on these cues.

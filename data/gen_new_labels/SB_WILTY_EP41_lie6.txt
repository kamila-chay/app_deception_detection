Based on the cues in the video, I'm inclined to think the person might be lying, though I can't say for certain. Their consistent scowl, furrowed eyebrows, and tightly pulled-back lips suggest a level of tension that seems more than just frustration. The way their chin is slightly lowered, holding tension in the jaw, combined with the repeated sideways glances and the slight head tilt, gives the impression they might be avoiding direct eye contact to hide something. The awkward pauses with their mouth closed add to this feeling, as if they're carefully choosing their words to avoid revealing the truth.

While it's true that these behaviors could also stem from genuine annoyance or a naturally serious demeanor, the overall pattern—especially that tight-lipped expression alongside the avoidance of gaze and hesitant speech—tends to align with stress markers often associated with deception. Of course, without knowing the full context or what they're actually saying, it's hard to be sure. But given the combination of these signals, I lean toward the possibility that they might not be entirely truthful in this instance.

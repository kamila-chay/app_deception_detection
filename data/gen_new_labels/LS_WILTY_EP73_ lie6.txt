Looking at this clip, it feels a bit ambiguous, but I find myself leaning toward the possibility that the person might be lying. They appear unusually calm, which could suggest they’re skilled at concealing nervousness rather than genuinely being at ease. While they don’t display typical signs of deception like fidgeting, excessive blinking, or avoiding eye contact, the fact that they keep looking up instead of at the person they’re speaking to feels somewhat off. 

Although looking up can sometimes indicate someone is trying to recall a real memory, it can also be a tactic to avoid direct engagement or to fabricate a response. The calmness might not be a sign of honesty but rather an effort to maintain a controlled demeanor to avoid raising suspicion. Without more context, it’s hard to be certain, but that composed attitude combined with the upward gaze gives me a slight impression of someone who’s perhaps not being fully truthful. It’s not an obvious lie, but I would cautiously lean toward deception here until more information is available.

It's difficult to be certain just from observing, but several signs suggest the person might be deceiving. The smile, with lip corners turned up, initially seems friendly, yet it can also be a common tactic people use to appear calm or trustworthy while lying, especially if they're nervous. The frequent blinking could indicate stress or pressure, which often accompanies attempts to fabricate or recall information. Additionally, the sideways glances while speaking might reflect the mental effort of constructing a story, though this is not definitive.

Interestingly, the person maintains fairly steady eye contact, which complicates the picture. While it's often believed that liars avoid eye contact, some overcompensate by holding it more than usual, which could be happening here. The subtle head shakes and sideways head tilt might simply be nervous habits or signs of engagement, but they don't rule out deception outright.

There is also the possibility that the smile is genuine, and that blinking or sideways glancing could be due to factors like fatigue or natural mannerisms. The consistent eye contact could challenge the deception theory, as people lying often avert their gaze—but this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule.

Taking everything into account, I tend to lean toward the idea that the person might be lying, primarily due to the combination of the smile and blinking patterns, coupled with some other subtle cues. However, this impression is far from certain, and they could simply be naturally expressive or reacting to external factors. Without more context or a fuller interaction to analyze, this remains a tentative conclusion rather than a definitive judgment.

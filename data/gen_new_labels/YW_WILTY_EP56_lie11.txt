This is a bit tricky, but leaning toward the person probably lying seems reasonable. While they maintain steady eye contact throughout, which typically suggests honesty, sometimes people who are skilled at deception deliberately hold eye contact to appear trustworthy. The nodding might indicate engagement, but it could also be a tactic to reinforce their story. The subtle head shake and the slight chin lift are interesting—those small signs can hint at defensiveness or internal conflict, which might occur when someone is being deceptive. Although they don’t exhibit classic signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact, the presence of these subtle micro-behaviors combined with the otherwise calm demeanor makes me lean toward the idea that they could be lying. It’s not definitive, but the tension suggested by the chin lift and the contradictory head movements hint that they might not be entirely truthful.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I’m leaning toward the idea that this person might not be entirely truthful. While they maintain consistent eye contact and hold their palms up—both signs that typically indicate honesty—there are subtle cues that suggest otherwise. Their lips are pulled back as if tensing, and their chin moves upward in a way that could indicate they're trying to hold themselves together. They also touch their head or neck a few times, which often signals anxiety, and their slight head shake seems to dismiss or contradict what they're saying, a behavior sometimes linked to deception.

Of course, it’s possible these signs reflect nervousness about the situation rather than dishonesty. The lack of smiling or laughter might simply show they’re serious. Their steady eye contact and open palms could mean they’re genuinely trying to come across as trustworthy. However, when weighing all these cues together, the stress-related behaviors make me lean more toward deception, even if it’s not a certainty. Without more context, it’s hard to be sure, but overall, I’m inclined to suspect they might be lying.

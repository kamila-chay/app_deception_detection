Watching the clip, I find myself leaning towards the idea that this person might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. Their eyebrows shooting up and the way they look down at their hands instead of maintaining eye contact stands out as a potential sign of deception. People often avoid eye contact and display such subtle facial expressions when they are trying to hide something or feeling nervous about admitting the truth. The fact that their gaze stays down during their answer feels somewhat disengaged, which can be a red flag.

That said, it’s also possible that this behavior reflects thoughtfulness or shyness, as some people look down when concentrating on a tough question. They don’t show other obvious signs of lying—no fidgeting, awkward pauses, or forced smiles—which makes it a bit more ambiguous. Usually, deception might come with more nervous energy, like hand-rubbing or excessive blinking, but here they seem fairly still, almost just waiting for it to be over.

The raised eyebrows add complexity; this could indicate genuine surprise or confusion rather than deception. Maybe the question caught them off guard, leading to the avoidance of eye contact. It’s true that tiredness or distraction can cause similar behaviors, so it's not definitive.

Overall, the behavior feels more like discomfort or hesitation than a clear attempt to deceive, but the unusual combination of cues nudges me to lean slightly towards thinking they might not be fully truthful. There’s not enough here to be sure, and more context would really help clarify what’s going on.

While I'm not completely certain, as I observe the person's behavior, some cues suggest they might not be entirely truthful. They maintain consistent eye contact, almost as if deliberately trying to convince the other person, but this is mixed with occasional sideways glances that feel slightly off and could indicate discomfort or evasion. Their noticeably raised eyebrows and repeated head tilting give the impression of someone who might be nervous or trying to appear engaged, which can sometimes be signs of underlying stress.

Initially, one might think that steady eye contact signals honesty, since liars are often said to avoid looking directly at others. However, some people who lie overcompensate by holding eye contact intensely. The combination of these behaviors—the fixed gaze, the subtle shifts in head position, and the raised brows—suggests they might be managing their outward demeanor to mask uncertainty or deceit. Although they don't show classic signs like fidgeting or avoiding gaze entirely, these mixed signals can be indicative of someone not fully at ease.

Of course, it's possible these behaviors are just part of their natural communication style, and without clear signs of nervousness such as excessive blinking or defensive gestures, it's hard to be sure. Still, the way they blend direct eye contact with those slight distractions and gestures hints at a performance, perhaps an attempt to appear truthful when they're not. Given all this, I tend to lean toward thinking they might be lying, though there isn’t enough evidence to be definitive.

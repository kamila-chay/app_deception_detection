Honestly, while it's not completely clear, there are a few subtle signs that make me lean toward thinking they might be lying. The frequent blinking stands out—it’s more than usual and often linked to nervousness or discomfort, which can be a sign of deception. That repeated chin lift could be an attempt to appear more confident or defensive, which might suggest they’re masking something. Their eye contact is somewhat inconsistent too—they do look at the person, but the occasional glances downward might indicate an effort to avoid direct confrontation or scrutiny. Although none of these cues are definitive on their own, and there aren’t any obvious classic signs like fake smiles or excessive fidgeting, the combination of these behaviors makes me suspect they might not be telling the whole truth. Of course, it’s also possible they’re simply uncomfortable or stressed from the situation, so I wouldn’t say for certain, but I do tend toward believing there’s some level of deception here. More information would be needed before drawing a firmer conclusion.

Honestly, while I can't be completely certain, the cues in the video make me lean more toward the possibility that they might be lying. Although their steady eye contact and nodding typically suggest engagement and sincerity, I know some skilled liars can maintain eye contact to appear trustworthy. The raised eyebrows and slight chin tuck catch my attention—they could indicate stress or an attempt to appear surprised, which might be signs of discomfort or deception. Their slight head turn could also hint at mental preparation or avoiding directness, which often aligns with deceitful behavior.

On the other hand, they don't show the more obvious signs like fidgeting, lip biting, or awkward pauses, which complicates the interpretation. Still, the subtle stress indicators combined with behaviors that could be consciously controlled make me suspicious. I’m not fully convinced they’re definitely lying, but I lean toward deception given the mixed signals and those little, telling gestures. More context would help, but right now, I’d say it feels more like they’re trying to hide something than telling the whole truth.

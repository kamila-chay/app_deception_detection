Honestly, I'm not completely sure, but some of the signals here make me lean toward the person possibly being deceptive. For instance, they're nodding while speaking, which usually signals agreement or emphasis, but at the same time, they're shaking their head quickly as if saying "no." That kind of contradictory head movement feels off—it can sometimes indicate internal disagreement or an attempt to mask the truth. It might also be a nervous reflex, but I’ve noticed that people who are unsure or trying to sound convincing often show these mixed signals. 

They maintain direct eye contact, which often suggests honesty, but I’m aware that some liars do precisely this to appear more believable. Raised eyebrows might be a genuine expression of surprise or skepticism, so that alone doesn't tell us much. The lack of smiling or laughter could just mean they are serious or focused, but it might also signal discomfort related to deception.

On the other hand, these gestures could be innocent: maybe the head shaking is just a habit, and the raised eyebrows are natural reactions. Their steady eye contact and absence of fidgeting like touching their face lean slightly toward calmness and honesty, which complicates things.

The main issue that sticks out is the head shaking while speaking, which conflicts with the nodding and the words they are saying. This mismatch is often a sign of cognitive dissonance—where their body language contradicts what they're verbally expressing—which can point toward some level of deception. Yet, it’s not definitive since it might just be emphasis or a cultural nuance.

Overall, I’d cautiously lean toward thinking they might be lying because of that inconsistency, but I’m not fully convinced. It could easily be nervousness or a habitual gesture, so I’d want to consider the context and their exact words before drawing firmer conclusions. Right now, it feels more like an unsettled impression than clear proof they’re being truthful.

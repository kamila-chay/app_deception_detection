This is somewhat difficult to judge with certainty just from observing, but there are several subtle cues that make me lean toward the possibility that the person might not be entirely truthful. They do maintain eye contact with the interlocutor, yet their frequent downward gaze suggests some level of discomfort or avoidance, which can sometimes indicate deception. The repeated eyebrow raises seem a bit forced, as if they’re trying to feign surprise or disbelief in their own narrative. The head tilting, while often a sign of engagement, here feels a little off—possibly hinting at nervousness or an attempt to appear sincere.

Interestingly, they show no clear signs of overt stress like fidgeting or lip biting. Stillness while speaking can sometimes signal a conscious effort to appear calm and collected, which some deceivers use to mask their discomfort. The mixed signals—the downward gaze combined with a controlled demeanor—create a bit of an ambiguous picture, yet it subtly points toward a potential concealment rather than openness.

Of course, it’s possible these behaviors stem from shyness or deep concentration rather than dishonesty. Raised eyebrows might simply be expressive habits, and looking down can be a natural part of gathering thoughts. Without more context or knowledge of the subject matter, it’s hard to be definitive. However, based on what I see, I tend to lean slightly toward thinking there might be some deception involved, though it’s far from a certainty. Additional information or further observation would be necessary to make a more confident assessment.

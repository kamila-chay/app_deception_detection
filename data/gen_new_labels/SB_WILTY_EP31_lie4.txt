Honestly, I'm not completely certain, but based on what I'm observing, I lean slightly toward the possibility that they might be lying. Their frequent smiling could be an attempt to appear calm and genuine, which some people do when they’re deceiving. Although their eye contact and engaged gestures typically signal openness, these behaviors can also be consciously used to create trust. The open arms might suggest honesty, but they could also be a deliberate effort to seem non-threatening. The lack of classic nervous ticks like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact is notable, but it might indicate they are skilled at concealing their discomfort rather than truly being truthful.

On the other hand, some cues that usually hint at sincerity, such as nodding and head tilting, might simply be habitual or practiced behaviors designed to convince. The downward gaze might reflect thoughtfulness, yet it could also be a subtle sign of evasion. The absence of overt nervousness doesn’t guarantee honesty—it’s quite possible they are masking it effectively. While they come across as relaxed, which typically would suggest truthfulness, it could also mean they’re confident in maintaining a facade.

Given these mixed signals, I tend to lean toward suspicion that they might not be entirely truthful, though I can’t say this with high confidence. More information would be needed to make a clearer judgment, since deception can sometimes look very convincing and normal.

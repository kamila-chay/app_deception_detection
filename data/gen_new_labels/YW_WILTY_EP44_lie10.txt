After watching it several times, I find myself leaning toward the idea that they might not be entirely truthful. There’s a subtle upturn in their lip corners—a slight, almost forced smile—which combined with steady eye contact feels somewhat unnatural. Typically, people who are being honest or relaxed tend to glance away occasionally, so the consistent gaze feels off. The palms-up gesture paired with the shrug is also notable; while some experts suggest these can signal openness, they can equally be attempts to appear calm and innocent when someone is actually fabricating a story. It feels a bit rehearsed, especially since if they were genuinely unsure or just friendly, they might not simultaneously use the shrug and that slight smile—it strikes me as a bit contrived.

That said, there’s still a chance they’re simply polite or nervous, rather than deceptive. The eye contact might be a sincere effort to engage, and the shrug could just be a natural response to uncertainty. I have seen honest people employ these exact gestures in casual, truthful conversations. Plus, the absence of more overt signs of deception like fidgeting or evasiveness makes me question whether I’m reading too much into it. Perhaps they’re just a bit awkward, and the smile is their default expression when pondering something.

All in all, it’s a borderline case, but the mix of the controlled smile and seemingly deliberate gestures nudges me toward suspecting they might be lying. I wouldn’t claim certainty—it’s plausible they’re just being themselves—but based purely on these signals, I lean more toward deception than honesty.

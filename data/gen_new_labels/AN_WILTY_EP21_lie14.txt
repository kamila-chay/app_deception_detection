Based on what I’m observing, I’m inclined to think that the person might not be entirely truthful, though I can’t be completely certain. They maintain direct eye contact, which is somewhat unusual because people who lie often avoid looking at the person they’re speaking to. However, their eyes do frequently drift sideways while they talk, as if they're either checking something or trying to recall information. This repeated sideways glance, along with the slight tilting and turning of their head, seems a bit unnatural—it’s not the typical avoidance but still suggests they might not be fully engaged or open in the conversation.

At the same time, they don’t display the usual nervous behaviors associated with lying: no fidgeting, awkward smiles, or excessive blinking. Their calm and composed demeanor could mean they’re just confident or perhaps well-prepared, which complicates the interpretation. Some people are simply skilled at masking deception, so it’s possible they could be telling the truth, and maybe those sideways looks are just part of their thinking style or due to distraction.

Nonetheless, the repetitive nature of the sideways eye movements strikes me as suspicious because truthful people’s eye movements tend to be more natural and fluid, rather than fixed. While this alone isn’t conclusive, it does raise some doubts. They don’t appear obviously guilty, but they also don’t seem fully present, which makes me lean toward the idea that they might be withholding something. Overall, I wouldn’t say it’s certain, but given these subtle clues, I’m more inclined to suspect deception than honesty at this point.

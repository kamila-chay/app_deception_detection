Watching the clip, there are some subtle cues that make me lean towards the possibility that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely clear-cut. While they maintain direct eye contact—which often suggests honesty—it's important to remember that some skilled liars are aware of this and use it deliberately to appear trustworthy. Their calm demeanor and lack of nervous behaviors like fidgeting or excessive blinking could indicate confidence in their story, but this confidence might stem from having rehearsed or being comfortable with deception rather than truthfulness.

The head shaking stands out as a notable gesture; even though it appears natural and common in conversation, it could also be a deliberate reinforcement of their denial, a way to make their claim more convincing. The absence of other signs of tension might not necessarily mean honesty but could point to a composed and practiced lie. Given that there is no context about what they're being asked or their usual behavior, it's difficult to determine definitively. However, the combination of these factors slightly tilts my impression toward deception, even if I can't say with high confidence. Ultimately, without more information, I lean toward thinking they are probably not being entirely truthful.

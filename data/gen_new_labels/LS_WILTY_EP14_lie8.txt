Watching the clip, I find myself leaning more toward the idea that the person might be lying, though it's not entirely certain. While they do maintain steady eye contact and tilt their head in ways that suggest engagement and listening, some of their other behaviors raise doubts. The frequent scratching of the head and touching of the face stands out as a common sign of stress or discomfort, which can often accompany deception. Their raised eyebrows might indicate defensiveness rather than surprise, adding to the sense that they could be trying to mask something.

Although it's true that they aren't avoiding eye contact or forcing smiles—which might typically suggest honesty—these signs alone aren't enough to dismiss the possibility of lying. Nervous gestures like head-scratching can sometimes be linked to an effort to cover up the truth, and the subtle hesitation in their chin movement might hint at someone carefully choosing their words rather than responding openly. Overall, while there are some cues that might point toward honesty, the balance tips slightly toward deception given the combination of fidgeting and facial expressions. Without additional context, it remains a bit uncertain, but I tend to lean toward them not being fully truthful.

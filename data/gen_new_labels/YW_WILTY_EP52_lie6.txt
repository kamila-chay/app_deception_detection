Based on what I’m observing in the video, I lean toward the possibility that the person might be lying, although I’m not completely certain. Their facial expressions show a mix of raised eyebrows and a slight frown, which could suggest they are trying to appear calm or engaged while actually feeling some stress or discomfort about the question. This kind of mixed signal often points to an attempt to mask true emotions. The slight chin lift also seems like a subtle effort to project confidence or control, which could be a sign of managing their image during a difficult moment. They maintain steady eye contact throughout, which might indicate an attempt to convince or appear honest, as some people do when they’re not telling the truth.

However, it’s possible that their expressions are simply signs of genuine confusion or frustration rather than deceit. The chin movement isn’t overly exaggerated and might just be a natural gesture. Also, the absence of more obvious signs like fidgeting or avoiding eye contact gives me some pause. People often look tense when they’re under pressure or nervous, too.

Overall, while it could be a case of genuine discomfort, the combination of conflicting facial cues and the controlled gestures leans me towards thinking there’s a chance the person is not being entirely truthful. It’s not definitive, but I tend to lean that way.

Based on what I'm seeing in the video, I lean toward the idea that they might be lying, though I'm not entirely certain. They do make steady eye contact, which often suggests honesty, since liars tend to avoid looking directly at someone. However, they also glance down and to the side occasionally, which could indicate they're thinking hard or trying to piece together a story. While these glances aren't overly nervous or frantic, they do raise some suspicion that their responses might not be entirely natural.

Moreover, the fact that they show no signs of typical stress—no fidgeting, no increased blinking, no forced smiles—could be a sign they’re trying too hard to appear calm. Sometimes, people who lie convincingly maintain an almost unnatural composure, which can actually be a subtle clue that they’re hiding something.

That said, I recognize these cues aren’t definitive. Some people naturally look down or sideways when concentrating, and their maintained eye contact suggests comfort with their words. Still, this calmness combined with those small gaze shifts makes me lean toward deception rather than complete honesty. It's not a clear-cut case, but given these mixed signals, I tend to suspect they're not fully truthful, even if I can’t say that with full confidence.

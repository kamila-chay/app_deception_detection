Watching the video closely, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues worth considering. Their gaze occasionally shifts sideways, which might initially raise questions about potential evasiveness or discomfort. Some might interpret a sideways glance as a sign of deceit or trying to avoid direct scrutiny. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions solely on that basis, as eye movement can also be influenced by many other factors—such as recalling information, processing thoughts, or even simple distraction.

Given that the individual is suspected of lying, the sideways gaze could still be reflective of cognitive effort rather than deception. People often look away momentarily to better retrieve memories or formulate honest responses. It also doesn't appear that this behavior is accompanied by other typical signs of lying, such as excessive fidgeting, inconsistent facial expressions, or verbal hesitations in the video.

While a cautious approach would acknowledge the possibility that sideways glances can sometimes indicate discomfort or withholding, in this context—and without further contradictory signs—the evidence leans toward genuine communication. So, taking these points into account, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is likely being truthful, though with the caveat that this interpretation relies heavily on limited behavioral observation and should be considered as a well-informed impression rather than an absolute certainty.

Watching the video, there are several subtle cues that suggest the person might be entirely truthful. Their lip corners alternately shift up and down, which can sometimes indicate mixed emotions or discomfort with the statement being made. The changes in chin position, moving both upwards and downwards, might reflect an internal conflict or hesitation. Additionally, their gaze shifts from looking directly at the interlocutor to looking upwards, which some research associates with cognitive load or fabricating information.

At the same time, the person occasionally nods and adopts open body language, such as palms up and arms open. Typically, these gestures are considered signs of openness and honesty, which strongly support the assumption that they’re telling the truth. However, such behaviors can also be consciously or unconsciously employed to appear credible or to convince the listener.

Taking these observations together, while there are gestures that suggest possible hesitation, the presence of primarily sincere signals—like the open body language, nodding, and reassuring gestures—leans toward the person being truthful. It seems reasonable to conclude that the person is likely being honest, though some of their subtle cues add nuance to the picture, making it an educated assessment rather than a certainty.

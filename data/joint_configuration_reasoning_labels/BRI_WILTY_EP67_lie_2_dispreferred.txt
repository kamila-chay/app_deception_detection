Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that suggest the possibility of truthfulness, though it’s important to remain cautious before drawing firm conclusions. For instance, their gaze shifts frequently—from looking directly at the interlocutor, then upwards, and sideways—patterns that can sometimes indicate cognitive effort or discomfort, as if they are trying to recall an event naturally rather than construct or navigate a story. The upward and sideways glances might reflect attempts to access internal thoughts or to avoid sustaining eye contact in a straightforward manner.

Moreover, the person’s use of open-handed gestures, like palms facing up, could be interpreted as an unconscious attempt to appear honest or open, which is a common subtle strategy when someone is being truthful. However, it’s worth noting that open palms can also simply indicate a desire to communicate earnestly or emphasize sincerity, so this alone isn’t definitive.

On the other hand, their direct gaze towards the interlocutor aligns with typical truthful behavior, where people often maintain eye contact to convey sincerity. Yet, skilled deceivers sometimes maintain steady eye contact precisely to mask their lies, which complicates the analysis. Taking these mixed signals into account, the balance of nonverbal cues leans toward the person likely being truthful. The combination of gaze aversions interspersed with direct looks and the somewhat natural open-palm gesture lend weight to the likelihood that the person is fully transparent, even if parts of their behavior could be seen as consistent with deception. Overall, while there’s no smoking gun, the subtle openness and congruities in the nonverbal signals suggest an educated guess that the person is likely telling the truth.

Watching the video closely, the person’s behavior does raise some questions initially. The exaggerated eye opening could be interpreted in different ways. Typically, such a behavior might be seen as a sign of surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity, but it can also sometimes be associated with someone trying a bit too hard to convince the viewer, which might hint at honesty. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions based on this alone.

In this case, given the context that the person is known to be lying, it seems more likely that the exaggerated eye opening is a natural reaction—perhaps to the seriousness of the situation or an expression of genuine emotion rather than a calculated trick. It could be a way the person unconsciously tries to appear more open or transparent. While an exaggerated eye opening can sometimes be a positive sign, it doesn’t outweigh other subtle cues such as overall calmness, consistency in speech, and the absence of other deceptive body language.

Balancing these observations, I lean toward the idea that despite the slightly unusual eye behavior, the individual is indeed lying. It’s a reminder that single gestures need to be considered within the broader context and not isolated as definitive evidence of honesty.

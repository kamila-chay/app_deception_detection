Watching the video, there are a few subtle cues that suggest the person might not be entirely truthful. For one, the raised eyebrows could indicate an attempt to emphasize sincerity or openness, which sometimes happens when someone feels the need to convince the listener or overcompensate for a lie. At the same time, the steady gaze towards the interlocutor could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, maintaining eye contact often signals honesty and confidence, which might suggest truthfulness. Yet, when combined with the eyebrow-raising, it could also reflect a deliberate effort to appear credible, possibly masking underlying deceit.

While none of these behaviors alone definitively point to lying, the way they come together here raises some doubts. The person seems to be over-exerting an expression of openness, which often happens when someone is trying too hard to convince the other party. Given the context and these nuances, I lean towards the conclusion that the person is likely being deceptive, though it remains an educated guess rather than an absolute certainty.

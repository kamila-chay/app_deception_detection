Observing the person's behavior in the video, several subtle yet telling cues stand out that suggest they might not be telling the truth. The shifting of the chin—sometimes moving upwards and other times downwards—could indicate a level of discomfort or an internal conflict, which is often linked to deceptive behavior. Additionally, the alternation between maintaining direct gaze towards the interlocutor and glancing sideways might reflect an oscillation between wanting to appear sincere and feeling uncertain or evasive. The head side-turn further reinforces this possibility, as it can signal a desire to distance oneself from the conversation or the statement being made.

On the other hand, some of these behaviors could be interpreted differently. For instance, raising the eyebrows and frowning might simply reflect surprise or confusion rather than dishonesty. Similarly, gaze shifts and head movements can be natural responses during a conversation, especially if the person is trying to recall information or is feeling anxious but truthful.

That said, when considering the combination of these behaviors collectively—especially the repeated chin movements coupled with the inconsistent gaze patterns—it forms a pattern more commonly associated with deceptive behavior. While none of these signs alone definitively prove lying, the overall impression leans toward the person likely not being fully truthful in this instance.

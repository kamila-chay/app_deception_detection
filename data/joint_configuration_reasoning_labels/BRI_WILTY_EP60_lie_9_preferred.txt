Watching the video, the person's behavior suggests some interesting cues that could point toward dishonesty, though it's important to remain cautious before drawing a firm conclusion. The individual maintains consistent eye contact with their interlocutor, which, on the surface, might imply openness and honesty. Generally, steady gaze is often interpreted as a sign of confidence and truthfulness. However, it's also possible that the person is consciously trying to appear credible, deliberately sustaining eye contact to mask any internal discomfort or deceit.

Another notable behavior is the rubbing of hands, which tends to be a self-soothing gesture. This could indicate some level of nervousness or unease, commonly observed when someone is not telling the truth. Yet, it's worth considering that hand rubbing might also stem from other causes unrelated to deception, such as stress from being recorded or simply feeling cold.

Balancing these observations, while the steady gaze could be an attempt to appear honest, the hand-rubbing behavior introduces a subtle but meaningful sign of tension that undermines that facade. Taken together, these signs lean toward the conclusion that the person may be lying, though there's always room for alternative explanations. The combination of deliberate eye contact and self-comforting gestures often raises a red flag in the context of honesty, making this an educated guess rather than an absolute determination.

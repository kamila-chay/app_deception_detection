Watching the video, I noticed several behaviors that offer mixed signals and make it a bit challenging to arrive at a definitive conclusion about the person's truthfulness. On one hand, the smile and palms-up gestures can be interpreted as signs of openness and engagement, which often correlate with honesty. The smile seems genuine, not forced, and the palms-up movement tends to suggest a willingness to be transparent or cooperative.

However, there are also some cues that could raise suspicion if taken in isolation. The person’s gaze frequently shifts sideways, which some might interpret as an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, potentially signaling discomfort or evasion. Additionally, the hands covering the face or mouth could be a sign of nervousness or even a subtle attempt to conceal something.

That said, these behaviors don't necessarily equate to deception. People often display nervous habits when telling the truth, especially if the topic is sensitive or emotionally charged. It’s also possible that the sideways gaze is simply a habit or a way to collect thoughts. Given that the smile and open gestures are present alongside these more ambiguous signals, my best assessment is that the person is likely telling the truth. The combination of openness in some cues, balanced with natural signs of nervousness, aligns with the behavior of someone being honest but perhaps a bit uneasy in the situation. So, while there are hints that could suggest otherwise, the overall impression is that this person is not being deceptive.

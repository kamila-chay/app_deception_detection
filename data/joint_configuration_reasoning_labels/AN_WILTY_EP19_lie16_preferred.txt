Watching the video, it appears the individual maintains a steady gaze towards their interlocutor at times, which can often be interpreted as a sign of engagement and honesty. This direct eye contact generally suggests openness and a willingness to communicate truthfully. However, there are also moments when the person looks upwards, which some might view as an attempt to access memories or, alternatively, as a sign of mental fabrication.

Considering these behaviors, the mixture of steady gaze and upward looks creates some ambiguity. While consistent eye contact could lean towards sincerity, the upward gaze introduces doubt—it might be a cognitive effort to construct a story rather than recall factual information. Given this combination, there’s reasonable ground to suspect the person may not be fully truthful in this instance, even though some aspects of their behavior appear sincere. Without additional context or more distinct cues, it’s difficult to be certain, but the subtle tension between openness and potential mental searching tilts the assessment slightly towards deception.

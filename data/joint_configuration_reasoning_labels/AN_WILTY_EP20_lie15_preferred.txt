Upon observing the person's behavior in the video, there are a few subtle cues that suggest a level of uncertainty or discomfort. Notably, the individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which could be interpreted as an attempt to appear sincere and engaged. However, this direct eye contact might also be a strategic effort to mask deception, as people often try to overcompensate when they know they are not being truthful. 

At the same time, the slight side-turn of the head could indicate a degree of evasiveness or reluctance to fully confront the situation. Such a gesture might reflect internal conflict or an effort to distance oneself from the statement being made, which can be a sign of deceit. It's worth considering that head movements like these could also be habitual or due to other factors like discomfort unrelated to lying. 

Balancing these observations, the combination of sustained gaze and subtle head turning might imply that the person is attempting to manage how they are perceived while simultaneously feeling uneasy about the truthfulness of their words. Given these nuances, it seems reasonable to lean towards the conclusion that the individual is likely not being fully honest, though without more context, we cannot be absolutely certain.

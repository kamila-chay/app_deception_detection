Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests some signs that could be associated with deception, though it's not entirely straightforward. For instance, there is noticeable raising of the eyebrows coupled with frequent blinking. These cues can sometimes indicate discomfort or a heightened cognitive load, which might occur when someone is fabricating information or trying to mask the truth. The raised eyebrows might also be an attempt to appear more sincere or to solicit trust from the viewer, which could be a subtle, unconscious giveaway.

On the other hand, these behaviors aren’t definitive proof of lying on their own. Raising eyebrows can simply express surprise or curiosity, and frequent blinking might result from external factors such as nervousness unrelated to deception or even dry eyes. It’s important to consider the context and baseline behavior of the individual, which isn’t available here.

Still, weighing these observations, the combination of raised eyebrows and increased blinking tends to lean toward signaling internal conflict or stress. Given this, it’s reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person might indeed be concealing the truth, though with an acknowledgment that these signals alone don’t make it an absolute certainty. The overall impression is of someone who is likely not being entirely forthcoming.

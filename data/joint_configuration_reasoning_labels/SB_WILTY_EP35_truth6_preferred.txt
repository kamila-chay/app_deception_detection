Watching the video, the person's behavior is quite intriguing. Their exaggerated mouth opening might initially suggest an attempt to emphasize points, which can sometimes be a sign of fabrication or overcompensation. However, this could also simply reflect genuine surprise or a natural expressiveness tied to telling a true story. The direct gaze toward the interlocutor generally lends credibility, as liars often avoid eye contact to conceal dishonesty. On the other hand, some people might deliberately maintain eye contact when lying to appear convincing, so this alone isn’t definitive. The head shaking is the more ambiguous cue here — it might indicate disagreement or a subtle nonverbal correction, but it could also be a nervous or unconscious response.

Balancing these observations, it seems plausible that the person is telling the truth. The direct gaze and natural expressiveness, despite some exaggerated gestures, align more closely with honest communication. While the head shaking introduces a slight complexity, it doesn’t strongly contradict the overall impression. So, considering these behaviors together, an educated guess would lean toward the person being truthful, though it's important to note that nonverbal cues can be quite context-dependent and not always straightforward indicators.

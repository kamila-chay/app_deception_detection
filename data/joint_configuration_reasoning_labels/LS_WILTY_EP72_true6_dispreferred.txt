Watching the video, the individual presents behaviors that could be interpreted in different ways, making it a bit challenging to determine their truthfulness with absolute certainty. The person raises their eyebrows and moves their chin upwards, both of which might indicate thoughtfulness or emphasis on what they are saying. Their gaze predominantly focuses on the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and a willingness to connect, which often aligns with honest communication. However, the occasional upward gaze could be a sign of internal reflection or accessing memory, possibly indicating that they are recalling information rather than fabricating it.

On the other hand, some might argue that certain gestures like raising eyebrows and looking up can also be cues related to deception, as people sometimes show physical signs when trying to construct or manipulate a narrative. Still, in this case, the consistent gaze towards the listener and the natural movement of the chin feel less forced and more spontaneous, lending less credibility to their statements.

Taking these subtle nuances into account, it seems reasonable to lean toward the belief that the person is not telling the truth. While there are some behaviors that could support honesty, the overall demeanor and engagement point more convincingly to deception rather than honesty. It's an educated guess, of course, but the evidence reasonably supports untruthfulness in this context.

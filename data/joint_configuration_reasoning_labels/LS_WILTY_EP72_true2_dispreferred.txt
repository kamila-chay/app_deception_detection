Watching this video, the person’s behavior appears fairly consistent with someone who is being deceptive, although it’s always important to consider alternative explanations. Their gaze is directed toward the interlocutor, which often indicates engagement and openness—people who tell the truth tend to maintain natural eye contact without frequent shifts of focus. That said, gaze behavior alone isn’t a foolproof indicator; some truthful individuals may avoid eye contact due to nervousness or discomfort.

Another point to consider is that the person occasionally looks upward. This can sometimes be interpreted as someone constructing a narrative rather than recalling true memories, which might support the idea that the person is fabricating details. However, it's also possible that this upward gaze is a sign of accessing genuine visual memories, which could lean towards truthful recollection. The context and frequency of these glances matter, and without more information, it’s difficult to be definitive.

Taking these behaviors together, the balance of evidence gently favors the conclusion that the person is lying. Maintaining gaze with the listener along with the nature of upward glances suggest narrative construction rather than genuine recollection, but since none of these signs are definitive on their own, this remains an informed estimation rather than an absolute judgment.

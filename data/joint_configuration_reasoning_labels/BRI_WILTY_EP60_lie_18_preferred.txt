Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that could be interpreted in different ways. At times, they maintain gaze towards the interlocutor, which might suggest engagement and honesty, as people often look at others when they want to appear sincere. However, there are moments when their gaze shifts downward, which could indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact—something commonly observed when someone feels uneasy or is potentially hiding the truth.

Of course, it’s important to consider that looking down isn’t always a sign of deception; it might simply reflect thinking or processing information. Similarly, steady eye contact doesn’t guarantee truthfulness, as people can deliberately maintain it to mask dishonesty. Still, the combination of these behaviors—shifting between direct gaze and looking down—may signal an internal conflict or a subtle effort to manage how their message is being received.

Taking these observations together, and knowing the context that the person is in fact lying, it seems that their body language supports this conclusion. The occasional downward glance could be an unconscious giveaway of discomfort or evasion, subtly undermining the otherwise attentive gaze. Therefore, while it’s not definitive on its own, the interplay of these eye movements leans toward the interpretation that the person isn’t being fully truthful.

Watching the video, I notice the person alternates their gaze between looking directly at the interlocutor and then shifting their eyes sideways. This pattern of eye movement could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, maintaining some eye contact suggests a desire to appear open and honest, as people who are truthful often engage with their conversational partner. On the other hand, the occasional sideways glance might indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid sustained eye contact, which can sometimes signal deception or uncertainty.

While the gaze behavior alone isn't definitive proof of truthfulness—after all, some individuals naturally shift their gaze when thinking or processing questions—the combination of direct and sidelong looks here could reflect a subtle balance between wanting to be transparent and feeling naturally reflective about their statements. The sideways glances might be a subconscious effort to thoughtfully consider their words or to gauge the reaction of the interlocutor.

Given these observations, I lean toward the likelihood that the person is being truthful. It’s important to acknowledge, however, that gaze behavior can vary widely among individuals and situations, so although the evidence leans toward honesty, it’s not absolutely conclusive on its own.

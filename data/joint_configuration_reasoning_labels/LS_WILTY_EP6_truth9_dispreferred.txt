Watching the video closely, the person seems to maintain steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and sincerity. Their gaze doesn’t appear to wander excessively or avoid the other person, which can sometimes be a sign of discomfort or deceit. Additionally, the individual nods occasionally throughout the conversation, which might indicate agreement or understanding, further reinforcing a sense of openness. The subtle side-turning of the head could be interpreted in different ways—it might be a natural movement or a way to process thoughts during the exchange, rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive.

On the other hand, some might argue that nodding or certain head movements could be consciously controlled behaviors meant to convey trustworthiness, which could complicate the interpretation. However, given the combination of steady gaze and fluid, natural gestures, the overall impression leans toward the person being deceptive. While it’s always possible for nonverbal cues to be misread or manipulated, the pattern here aligns more closely with dishonesty than honesty. Therefore, based on these observations, I would lean toward the conclusion that the person is lying.

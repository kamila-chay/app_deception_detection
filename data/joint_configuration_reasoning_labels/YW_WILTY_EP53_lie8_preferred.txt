Watching the video, the person maintains steady eye contact with the interlocutor throughout the interaction. At first glance, this behavior might suggest openness and honesty, as many believe that direct gaze indicates sincerity. However, it’s important to consider that some individuals who are lying can deliberately maintain eye contact to appear more credible, consciously compensating for potential signs of deception.

While the gaze towards the interlocutor could imply engagement and truthfulness, it doesn’t necessarily rule out deception. Given the context and knowing that this individual is actually lying, it seems likely they are using this direct gaze as a strategic effort to mask their dishonesty. The consistency and confidence in their eye contact might be more rehearsed than genuine, designed to create trust and reduce suspicion.

Though it’s difficult to be completely sure without additional cues, the deliberate and sustained gaze in this scenario leans toward an educated inference that the person is concealing the truth rather than openly sharing it. So, considering both possibilities, it’s reasonable to conclude that despite the appearance of honesty suggested by their gaze, the person is likely fabricating or withholding information.

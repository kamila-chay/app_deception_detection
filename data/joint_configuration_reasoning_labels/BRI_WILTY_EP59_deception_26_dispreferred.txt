Watching the video, the person’s behavior offers some subtle but interesting cues. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and then shifting upwards. This pattern can be somewhat ambiguous—on one hand, maintaining eye contact often suggests honesty or engagement, as people tend to look at someone when they want to build trust. On the other hand, the upward gaze might indicate they are trying to access a mental construct or are hesitating, which can be a sign of recalling information or carefully considering details.

Of course, it's important to consider that upward gaze does not definitively mean deception—it could simply indicate thinking or recalling past events. The direct gaze also complicates the interpretation, as truthful people often maintain eye contact to show sincerity, while others consciously avoid it to hide uncertainty.

Balancing these observations, the combination of deliberate gaze towards the interlocutor alongside a quick, seemingly purposeful shift upward suggests a thoughtful engagement and an effort to provide an accurate response. This behavioral pattern leans toward the person being truthful. While these cues are not foolproof, the subtle interplay between engagement and mental search aligns well with a scenario where the individual is telling the truth.

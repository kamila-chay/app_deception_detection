Watching the video, the person maintains steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and sincerity. This kind of gaze can be interpreted in multiple ways, though. On one hand, sustained eye contact might be a sign of truthfulness, as liars sometimes avoid direct gaze to conceal deception. On the other hand, some individuals are skilled at maintaining eye contact precisely to appear convincing even when being untruthful.

That said, the naturalness of the gaze—how relaxed and consistent it appears—seems genuine rather than rehearsed or forced. The person doesn’t avert their eyes abruptly or show signs of discomfort that might accompany fabrication. While this is no definitive proof, the overall demeanor aligns more closely with honest communication.

Given these observations, and considering that the person’s gaze behavior fits comfortably with typical truthful interaction patterns, my best estimation is that they are, indeed, being truthful. That said, it’s important to remain aware that gaze alone is not infallible as a cue, and other factors would ideally be considered for a more comprehensive assessment.

Watching the video, the person's behavior invites a nuanced interpretation. At first glance, the raised eyebrows could be seen as a sign of surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty, yet this gesture can also be a subtle way to overcompensate and appear more convincing. The nodding, typically associated with agreement or affirmation, might reinforce their statements, but it could also be a rehearsed mannerism intended to persuade or distract. Meanwhile, the palms-up gesture often signals openness and sincerity, but in some cases, it might be employed deliberately to mask deceit by projecting vulnerability. 

While these behaviors could be consistent with someone genuinely communicating, the combination and context here seem a bit too calculated, as if the person is layering nonverbal cues to convince rather than naturally express themselves. Given these observations, it seems plausible that the individual is not being entirely truthful. Of course, one could argue that such gestures arise from nervousness or habit, but the overall impression leans toward deliberate fabrication. Thus, with a reasonable degree of confidence, I would estimate that the person is likely lying.

Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some subtle cues that make me lean toward the conclusion that they might not be telling the truth. For instance, the lip corners turning up could initially suggest a genuine smile, which might indicate comfort or sincerity. However, in the context of the other gestures, this expression could also be a rehearsed or controlled display, perhaps an attempt to mask discomfort or to appear more believable.

Additionally, the downward movement of the chin stands out because it can be interpreted in different ways. It might signal a moment of contemplation or submission, which sometimes happens when someone is feeling uneasy or trying to suppress further information. This gesture doesn't strongly confirm deception on its own but adds a layer of complexity to the person's emotional state.

The person’s gaze directed towards the interlocutor is interesting because maintaining eye contact is often seen as a sign of honesty. Nonetheless, skilled deceivers are aware of this social cue and can deliberately hold eye contact to project sincerity. Given this, the steady gaze doesn't necessarily rule out deception but complicates the assessment.

Taking all these factors into account, while none point definitively to lying, the combination of controlled facial expressions and subtle signs of possible discomfort suggests the person might be concealing something. So, my educated guess is that they are likely not being fully truthful, though I acknowledge that these behaviors could also be consistent with other states such as nervousness or social pressure.

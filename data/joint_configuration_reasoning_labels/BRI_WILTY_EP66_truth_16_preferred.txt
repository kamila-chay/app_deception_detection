Observing the person's behavior in the video, one notable aspect is the sideways gaze during communication. This kind of eye movement can sometimes be interpreted differently depending on context. While some might argue that looking away could indicate discomfort or even evasiveness, it isn't necessarily a sign of deceit. People often glance sideways when processing information, recalling details, or simply out of habit. Given these considerations, it's plausible that the individual is not being untruthful but rather engaged in thoughtful reflection.

On the other hand, if we were to entertain the possibility that they might be lying, the sideways gaze could be viewed as a subtle attempt to avoid direct eye contact, potentially signaling concealment. However, without other corroborating behaviors typically associated with deception—such as fidgeting or hesitation—it feels premature to conclude dishonesty based solely on this cue.

Taking all this into account, and considering that the person is known to be truthful, it seems reasonable to interpret the sideways gaze as a natural, non-deceptive behavior rather than an indication of lying. This assessment is cautious, though, and acknowledges that eye movement alone can't definitively determine veracity.

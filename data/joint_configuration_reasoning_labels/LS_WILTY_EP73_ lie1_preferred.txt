Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues. There are moments where they raise their eyebrows, which can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity. Their gaze shifts towards the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and perhaps an effort to connect or persuade. However, this direct gaze is occasionally interrupted by downward glances, which might signal discomfort or hesitation.

If the person were being entirely truthful, these behaviors could represent natural expressions of attentiveness mixed with occasional reflective thought. But considering the subtle tension conveyed through the intermittent gaze downward, there seems to be an underlying unease that doesn't quite align with straightforward honesty. The eyebrow raises may be somewhat exaggerated, potentially serving as a way to mask that discomfort or to overcompensate in an effort to appear credible.

While none of these signs conclusively prove deception on their own, taken together they create a picture of someone who might be struggling with the truth. The combination of direct engagement and fleeting avoidance suggests that the person is likely not being fully truthful, though they are attempting to appear sincere. Thus, it seems reasonable, based on these behavioral cues, to lean toward the conclusion that the person is lying.

Watching the video, the person’s behavior caught my attention in a few ways that suggest they are likely being truthful. Their eyebrows are furrowed, which often signals some form of discomfort or cognitive effort—something that can happen when someone is genuinely trying to recall or explain information. At the same time, I noticed that their gaze often shifts upwards rather than away or downward, which some theories suggest could indicate they are accessing a genuine memory rather than fabricating a response. Interestingly, they maintain gaze toward the interlocutor rather than avoiding eye contact, which could be an attempt to appear sincere and maintain control of the conversation.

On the other hand, it's worth considering that frowning can also stem from concentration or frustration unrelated to deception, and the direct gaze might just reflect engagement or confidence rather than deceit. People vary widely in how they show stress or honesty, so none of these behaviors alone conclusively prove truthfulness. Still, taken together—the combination of the furrowed brow, the upward gaze, and a steady but sincere eye contact pattern—these cues collectively lean towards the person being truthful. While it’s never possible to be 100% certain based on behavior alone, the evidence here reasonably supports the notion that the person is being honest.

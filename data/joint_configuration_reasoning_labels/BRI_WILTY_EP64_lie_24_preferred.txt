Watching the video, the person's behavior suggests some signs that could indicate they're not being entirely truthful. Their eyebrows raise noticeably, and their eyes open wider than usual, which can sometimes be unconscious attempts to appear more earnest or to draw attention. These exaggerated expressions might reflect an underlying discomfort or effort to convince the viewer, which could be consistent with someone trying to mask the truth.

However, it's important to consider that such behaviors alone don't guarantee deception—some people naturally gesture this way or might be reacting to surprise or emphasis rather than deceit. Without additional context, it's hard to say definitively. Still, given the subtle tension in their facial expression and the somewhat forced quality of their eye movements, there's a reasonable basis to suspect that the person might be lying in this instance.

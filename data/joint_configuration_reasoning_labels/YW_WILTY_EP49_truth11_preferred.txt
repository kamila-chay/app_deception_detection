Watching the person in the video, I notice they maintain steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and a level of confidence. This sustained gaze can be interpreted as a sign of honesty, as people who are being truthful tend to look more directly at their listeners. However, it's important to consider that some individuals might deliberately adopt this behavior to mask deception, so it doesn't guarantee honesty on its own.

At the same time, the person has their arms folded. This posture can sometimes indicate defensiveness or discomfort, which might raise suspicion about their openness. Yet, this gesture could simply be a natural resting position or a response to the environment rather than an indicator of deceit. People often fold their arms when they are feeling thoughtful or simply cold, so it shouldn't be taken as a definitive sign of lying.

Balancing these observations, the strong eye contact seems to outweigh the ambiguity of the folded arms. While the body language isn't perfectly open, the gaze toward the interlocutor leans more toward genuine engagement than evasion. Considering these subtle cues collectively, I lean toward the conclusion that the person is telling the truth, though I acknowledge that body language can be complex and context-dependent, so this remains an informed estimation rather than an absolute judgment.

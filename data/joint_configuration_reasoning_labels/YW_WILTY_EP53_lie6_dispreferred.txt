Watching the video, the person's behavior gives some interesting signals. The noticeable raising of the eyebrows coupled with the chin moving upwards could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, raising eyebrows can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to appear more open and honest, which might suggest sincerity. Similarly, lifting the chin might be a gesture to convey confidence or assertiveness, which could support a truthful presentation.

However, when considering these gestures altogether, especially in the context of someone potentially being truthful, these movements might instead be genuine behaviors. The raised eyebrows could be a natural expression of openness and honesty, reflecting a sincere effort to communicate transparently. Meanwhile, the upward chin movement may reflect confidence and a subconscious effort to project certainty that aligns with telling the truth.

Given the subtle ease in these nonverbal cues and the congruence between the gestures and the person's overall demeanor, it seems plausible that the person is being truthful. While these behaviors could be ambiguous or even indicators of deceit in another context, here they lean toward an authentic presentation intended to convey honesty. Thus, after weighing the possibilities, it appears more likely that the person is being entirely truthful.

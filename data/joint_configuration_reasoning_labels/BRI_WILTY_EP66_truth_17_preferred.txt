Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues that invite close consideration. They raise their eyebrows at moments, which can often be interpreted as a sign of surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating engagement with the subject matter. Their gaze shifts back and forth—sometimes directly toward the interlocutor, which suggests openness and willingness to communicate truthfully, but at other times the gaze moves sideways. This sideways look might raise some initial suspicion, as it can sometimes be associated with evasion or discomfort.

However, taking these behaviors together, especially the consistent gaze toward the interlocutor, leans more toward honesty than deceit. People who are lying often avoid direct eye contact or exhibit more signs of nervousness, whereas this person maintains engagement, albeit with occasional sideways glances that could simply reflect thoughtfulness or momentary distraction rather than deception. While the shifting gaze might cause some doubt, it alone is not a definitive indicator of lying.

Thus, considering the context and the overall behavioral pattern, the evidence tips toward the person telling the truth. Of course, none of these nonverbal signals can guarantee truthfulness with certainty, as individual quirks in behavior vary widely, but on balance, this person does not exhibit the classic signs associated with deception.

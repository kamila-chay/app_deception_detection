Watching the video, the person's behavior seems somewhat conflicted. Their eyebrows are furrowed in a way that could suggest discomfort or concentration, which might hint at some level of internal conflict or stress. At the same time, their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which generally can be interpreted as a sign of engagement and confidence. These two signals together create a bit of ambiguity.

If the person were entirely truthful, one might expect a more relaxed expression and consistent eye contact that reflects certainty and ease. The frowning eyebrows could indicate that they are struggling to maintain their story or are uneasy about what they’re saying. On the other hand, sustained gaze toward the listener often accompanies honesty, aiming to build trust or rapport.

Yet, it's also possible that the firm gaze is a deliberate strategy to avoid appearing evasive, compensating for the discomfort seen in their facial expression. This sort of controlled behavior can sometimes be a telltale sign of deception, where the person is trying too hard to seem sincere.

Balancing these observations, it seems more likely that the person is not being entirely truthful. The combination of discomfort suggested by the frown and the possibly calculated eye contact leans toward a scenario where they are masking underlying unease related to dishonesty. While it’s not definitive, the subtle tension in their expression alongside their gaze pattern points to the conclusion that they are probably lying.

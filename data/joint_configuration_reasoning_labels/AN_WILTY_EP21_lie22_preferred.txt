Observing the person's behavior, there are several subtle cues that might suggest they are not being entirely truthful. For instance, the downward movement of the chin combined with a lowered gaze could indicate a moment of discomfort or avoidance, which are often linked to deceptive behavior. The sideways glance might suggest an attempt to evade direct eye contact, a classic sign when someone is trying to conceal something. Interestingly, the contradictory nodding and head shaking could reflect an internal conflict or hesitation, perhaps signaling uncertainty about their own statements or an effort to appease the audience while withholding the truth.

However, it’s important to acknowledge that these behaviors can sometimes be attributed to nervousness or stress that aren’t necessarily connected to lying. People often exhibit similar gestures when they feel vulnerable or pressured, even when they are honest. That said, the combination and frequency of these signals—especially the avoidance of direct gaze paired with subtle facial movements—lean more toward a pattern commonly seen in deceptive behavior.

Taking all this into account, while it's possible that these behaviors could be misinterpreted under different circumstances, the overall clusters of nonverbal signals observed here make it reasonable to cautiously infer that the person might be lying. The subtle cues suggest an underlying tension or guard that aligns with deception, even if there is some room for doubt.

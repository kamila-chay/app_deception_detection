Watching the video, the person presents a complex mix of nonverbal cues that suggest some level of discomfort or possible deception. The smile appears somewhat forced or exaggerated, which can sometimes indicate that the person is trying too hard to appear sincere. Their eyebrows lift noticeably, and coupled with an exaggerated mouth opening, it gives off a sense of theatricality rather than a natural reaction, which might suggest they’re overcompensating to convince the viewer or interlocutor.

What’s interesting is the gaze pattern. The individual shifts between making direct eye contact and looking down, which could indicate an internal conflict or an attempt to conceal something. Generally, maintaining steady eye contact or completely avoiding it might be more telling, but this back-and-forth hints at some discomfort or hesitation. Additionally, their nodding could either be a sign of agreement and validation or an unconscious attempt to reinforce their statements.

Considering these behaviors together, it leans toward the person not being fully truthful. However, it's important to acknowledge that some people naturally behave this way, especially if nervous or under pressure, so these cues are not definitive proof of lying. But given the combination and the intensity of the expressions, an educated guess would be that the person is likely not being honest in this situation.

Watching the video, several aspects of the person's behavior stand out and suggest some level of discomfort or uncertainty, which could be indicative of deception. The person maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which might typically be seen as a sign of engagement or honesty. However, in some cases, deliberate eye contact can be a compensatory behavior used to convince others of truthfulness, especially if someone is trying to mask dishonesty.

The nodding behavior adds another layer to consider. Nodding can often convey agreement or reassurance, but when combined with other subtle cues, it might be an attempt to encourage the listener to accept what is being said without question. This could be a strategic move to create a sense of credibility, even if the underlying message is not entirely truthful.

Finally, the palms-up gesture is generally associated with openness and honesty. On the surface, this would contradict the idea of lying. Yet, gestures like this can sometimes be employed subconsciously or deliberately by someone who is trying to appear sincere despite deceptive intentions. It’s possible the person is attempting to bolster their perceived honesty through body language that signals transparency.

Balancing these observations, while none independently confirm deception, the combination suggests a degree of cognitive dissonance—behaviors that seem designed to persuade or reassure rather than spontaneously genuine expressions. Given this interplay, it feels reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is not being fully truthful. That said, without more context or corroborating evidence, it’s prudent to acknowledge the possibility that these behaviors might also stem from nervousness or other factors unrelated to lying. Overall, the signs point more toward deception, but it's a cautiously held judgment.

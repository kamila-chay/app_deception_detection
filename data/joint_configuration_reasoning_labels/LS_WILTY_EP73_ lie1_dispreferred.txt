Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues. There are moments where they raise their eyebrows, which can sometimes indicate surprise or an attempt to emphasize sincerity. Their gaze shifts towards the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and perhaps an effort to connect or persuade. However, this direct gaze is occasionally interrupted by downward glances, which might signal discomfort or hesitation.

If the person were being entirely truthful, these behaviors could represent natural expressions of attentiveness mixed with occasional reflective thought. The subtle tension conveyed through the intermittent gaze downward may simply reflect the seriousness of the topic rather than any underlying unease. The eyebrow raises may be somewhat exaggerated, potentially serving as a way to emphasize their points and reinforce their credibility.

While none of these signs conclusively prove honesty on their own, taken together they create a picture of someone who is genuinely engaged with the conversation. The combination of direct engagement and fleeting avoidance suggests that the person is being largely truthful, though they are thoughtfully considering their responses. Thus, it seems reasonable, based on these behavioral cues, to lean toward the conclusion that the person is telling the truth.

Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents a mixed set of signals that make it challenging to be absolutely certain about their honesty. At times, their gaze appears directed toward the interlocutor, which can suggest engagement and openness. However, this is intermittently interrupted by moments where they look down or to the side, behaviors that might be interpreted as signs of discomfort or evasion. Additionally, the slight upward movement of the lip corners could be construed as a tentative smile, though it might also mask underlying tension. Taken together, these subtle cues lean toward the possibility that the person is not entirely forthcoming. While none of these behaviors alone conclusively prove deception, the combination of gaze aversions alongside a potentially forced smile strengthens the case that they might be lying. Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that such behaviors could stem from nervousness or other factors unrelated to dishonesty, but considering the overall pattern, my educated guess is that the person is likely being untruthful.

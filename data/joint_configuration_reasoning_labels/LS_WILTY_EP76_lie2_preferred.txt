Observing the person in the video, their gaze consistently directed toward the interlocutor suggests a level of engagement and openness that often aligns with truthful communication. When someone maintains eye contact with the person they are speaking to, it typically signals confidence and sincerity, as they are not avoiding the listener’s scrutiny. However, it is worth considering that steady eye contact alone is not a foolproof indicator of truthfulness—some individuals may be skilled at mimicking this behavior to appear credible, and cultural differences can also influence gaze patterns.

Given the context and the natural, unforced manner in which the gaze is held, it seems more likely that the person is being honest. The absence of any evident discomfort or evasiveness in their expression supports this interpretation. While it remains possible that they could be concealing the truth despite their gaze, the overall behavior leans toward a truthful account. Therefore, taking these observations together, the best-supported conclusion is that the person is telling the truth, even though this assessment bears some inherent uncertainty.

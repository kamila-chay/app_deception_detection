Watching the video, the person’s behavior strikes me as somewhat ambiguous but leans toward being truthful. There are moments where they laugh, which on the surface might signal friendliness or ease, but combined with their lip corners turning down, it suggests an undercurrent of discomfort or sincerity. The upward movement of the chin, a subtle gesture, could be interpreted as a defensive or assertive signal, possibly an attempt to reveal vulnerability. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which might typically indicate honesty or engagement; and in this case, it reinforces their openness by maintaining genuine eye contact. The palms facing upward appear open, a gesture often linked to honesty or openness, and when juxtaposed with the other consistent cues, it seems to be a genuine and spontaneous display rather than a rehearsed or forced one. Considering all this together, it seems more likely they are expressing the truth openly rather than concealing it. That said, these behaviors can be context-dependent and subject to interpretation, so while the evidence suggests honesty, it is not conclusive beyond doubt.

Watching the video, the person's behavior seems quite consistent with someone who is being truthful. Their gaze is steady and directed towards the interlocutor, which generally suggests engagement and openness rather than evasion. The occasional nodding and the subtle forward movement of the head convey attentiveness and reinforce the impression that they are responsive to the conversation and confident in what they are saying.

Additionally, the open gestures—palms up and arms open—often signal transparency and a lack of defensiveness. Such body language typically aligns with someone who is not trying to conceal information or deceive. While it's always possible that someone might consciously adopt these behaviors to appear truthful, the naturalness and timing of these cues here don't give a sense of calculated effort.

On the other hand, one could argue that these behaviors might be consciously performed or habitual, which could muddy the waters when interpreting honesty. Yet, given the fluidity and authenticity projected throughout the video, it feels reasonable to lean towards the conclusion that the person is, in fact, telling the truth. Overall, the combination of gaze, nodding, head movement, and open gestures supports this assessment, though a degree of caution remains in any behavioral interpretation.

Watching the video, it’s noticeable that the person frequently directs their gaze upward while speaking. This kind of behavior can sometimes indicate that someone is accessing their imagination or trying to construct a story, which might suggest they are not fully being truthful. People often look up when they are attempting to recall or fabricate details rather than retrieve straightforward memories. However, it is important to acknowledge that gazing upward alone doesn’t definitively prove deception; some individuals naturally shift their gaze when thinking or concentrating, irrespective of honesty.

Still, given the context and considering that gaze aversion or upward glances are commonly discussed in studies on deceptive behavior, it seems reasonable to suspect that the person might be withholding the truth or embellishing information. While it’s not an absolute indicator—other factors such as nervousness, distraction, or simply a personal habit could also explain this behavior—the upward gaze raises a flag worth noting. We can't be completely certain, but this subtle cue leans toward the conclusion that the individual is likely not being entirely honest.

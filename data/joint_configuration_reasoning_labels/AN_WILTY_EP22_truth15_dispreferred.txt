Watching the video closely, the individual exhibits a mix of facial expressions and gestures that could be interpreted in different ways. The presence of a scowl and frowning eyebrows might suggest some level of frustration or disagreement, which could sometimes be seen when someone is concealing the truth or feeling defensive. However, these same expressions might also be consistent with someone who is genuinely trying to emphasize their sincerity or is grappling with the weight of what they are saying.

The person also raises their eyebrows and directs their gaze toward the interlocutor, which often indicates engagement and a willingness to communicate openly. The chin moving downwards paired with head shaking could be signs of hesitation or contemplation, but they might also reflect a nuanced attempt to convey earnestness rather than deception. Interestingly, the palms-up gesture is generally associated with openness and honesty, as if the person is symbolically offering their statements without reservation.

Given this combination, there is enough evidence to consider both possibilities: the expressions could be defensive or they could be genuine. But weighing the openness suggested by the gaze and palm gesture alongside the body language, it seems more likely that the individual is being truthful despite some outward signs that might initially appear as distrust. Ultimately, while it’s difficult to be entirely certain based solely on these cues, the overall impression leans strongly toward honesty rather than deceit.

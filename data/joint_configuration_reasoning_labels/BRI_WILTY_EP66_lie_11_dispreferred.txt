Watching the video, I notice that the person frequently averts their gaze sideways and subtly turns their head to the side. These behaviors often suggest discomfort or an attempt to distance oneself from the topic at hand. It’s possible that the individual is simply distracted or thinking carefully, which could explain the avoidance of direct eye contact and the head movement. However, when combined, these cues can also be interpreted as signs of careful consideration and thoughtfulness, hinting that the person is likely being truthful.

While people exhibit these behaviors for various reasons, the pattern here leans toward an effort to process information thoughtfully, which is often linked to honesty. Given this, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely telling the truth, though it’s important to acknowledge that without further context, absolute certainty isn't possible.

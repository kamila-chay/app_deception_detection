Watching the video, the person appears to maintain steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and sincerity. Their occasional nodding seems to reinforce their statements, signaling agreement or affirmation, typically indicators of a truthful exchange. The subtle crossing of fingers, rather than indicating discomfort or deceit, might simply be an unconscious gesture without deceptive intent. Considering the overall context and the person’s open gaze and affirmative body language, it's reasonable to confidently conclude that they are being truthful. While the crossed fingers might draw some attention, it's important to recognize that no single behavior definitively disproves honesty. Taking all cues into account, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion of sincerity and trustworthiness.

Watching the video closely, several behavioral cues stand out that suggest the person might not be entirely truthful. For instance, the frequent blinking and the subtle raising of the eyebrows could indicate a level of discomfort or an internal effort to process what they’re saying, both of which are sometimes linked to deceptive behavior. Additionally, the upward movement of the chin might signal a defensive stance, possibly an unconscious attempt to assert confidence while under scrutiny. 

Their gaze towards the interlocutor is sustained, yet combined with the head tilting and side-turning, it might reflect a conflicted state—trying to engage but simultaneously creating some distance. These movements can sometimes indicate someone who is trying to regulate their emotions or buy time to formulate a response that aligns with what they believe is expected, rather than the truth.

That said, none of these behaviors alone are definitive proof of lying; eyebrow raising and blinking can occur simply due to environmental factors or nervousness unrelated to deception. Similarly, head tilting might just be a natural way of engaging during conversation. However, when these signs appear together and in the context of carefully watching someone speak, they create a pattern that leans towards the likelihood of dishonesty. Based on this combination of subtle body language cues, the educated guess would be that the person is indeed lying, although it’s wise to remain open to alternative explanations given the complexity of human behavior.

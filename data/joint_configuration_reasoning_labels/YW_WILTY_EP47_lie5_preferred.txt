Watching the video, the person's behavior appears somewhat inconsistent, which raises some doubts about the truthfulness of their statements. For instance, the way they intermittently raise their eyebrows and briefly move their chin upwards could indicate a subtle attempt to appear more sincere or to emphasize their words. However, these gestures might also be interpreted as signs of discomfort or an unconscious effort to convince the other party, which can sometimes accompany deceptive behavior.

Moreover, their gaze shifts notably between direct eye contact with the interlocutor and sideways glances, which could be a sign of internal conflict — perhaps weighing what to say or monitoring the listener’s reactions. A steady gaze is often associated with honesty, but frequent aversion can suggest unease or dishonesty. That said, some people naturally glance around when thinking, so this pattern alone isn’t conclusive.

Additionally, the occasional head side-turn and subtle head shaking might signal disagreement, uncertainty, or attempts to distance themselves from their own words. These could be read as nonverbal cues pointing to deception, but they might also simply indicate discomfort or nervousness.

Balancing these observations, it seems more likely than not that the person is not being entirely truthful. The combination of eyebrow raises, chin movements, shifting gaze, and head gestures collectively suggests some level of concealment or fabrication. Still, none of these behaviors definitively confirm lying on their own, so while the evidence leans toward deception, a degree of caution in interpreting these signals remains important.

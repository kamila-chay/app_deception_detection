Watching the video, the person’s behavior seems generally consistent with someone who might be deceptive. They maintain their gaze toward the interlocutor, which sometimes can be a deliberate effort to appear engaged and open rather than deceptive. The occasional gaze down doesn’t necessarily imply honesty either; it can simply indicate an attempt to avoid direct contact while processing information. Additionally, their nodding appears natural, which could be used to reinforce the impression that they are attentive and agreeable rather than evasive.

The palms-up gesture tends to be an open, non-threatening signal, often associated with sincerity and a willingness to communicate openly. This, however, can also be consciously employed to mask concealment, complicating the assessment of their truthfulness.

Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that behaviors like gaze aversion can sometimes be linked to honesty, and gestures can vary widely by individual and context. Yet, in this instance, the combination of these cues leans more toward deception than honesty. Taking all these elements into account, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is likely not telling the truth.

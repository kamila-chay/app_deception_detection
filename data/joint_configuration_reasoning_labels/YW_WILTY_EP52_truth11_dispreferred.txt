Watching the video, the person's behavior appears overall consistent with someone who is fabricating information, though one can never be entirely certain without additional context. The individual raises their eyebrows at moments, which could signal openness or surprise, often linked with honesty rather than deception. Their gaze remains directed towards the interlocutor, suggesting engagement and a willingness to connect rather than avoidance, which is typically less common when someone is fabricating information. Additionally, the open positioning of their arms conveys a sense of openness and lack of defensiveness, further supporting the impression that they are not hiding anything.

That said, it’s important to consider that these behaviors alone aren't foolproof indicators—people can consciously or unconsciously mimic truthful cues even when not sincere, and some truthful individuals may exhibit nervousness or closed body language. However, the combination observed here leans more towards transparency and genuine communication. While it’s always good to remain somewhat cautious, given these observations, it’s reasonable to estimate that the person is likely lying.

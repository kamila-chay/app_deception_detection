Watching the video closely, the person's behavior appears fairly consistent with someone speaking deceptively. Their gaze occasionally shifts upwards, which could suggest they are fabricating details rather than recalling information or accessing memories. This subtle eye movement often aligns with attempts to construct falsehoods on the spot. Additionally, the slight head tilting seems more like a natural, thoughtful reaction masking discomfort or deceit rather than genuine contemplation.

Of course, these behaviors aren't definitive proof of deception. One could argue that gaze shifting or head tilting might also be nervous tics or natural reactions when recalling accurate information, which sometimes happen during honest communication. However, in this context, the overall demeanor seems somewhat guarded rather than wholly relaxed or open. Taken together, the cues imply that the person is likely being untruthful, though it's always worth considering that nonverbal signals can vary widely depending on individual differences and situational factors.

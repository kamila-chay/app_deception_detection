Watching the video, the individual demonstrates a set of subtle yet telling behaviors. The person occasionally raises their eyebrows, which can sometimes signify surprise or an attempt to emphasize honesty. However, raised eyebrows can also be a sign of discomfort or uncertainty, which might raise doubts about their truthfulness. Additionally, the slight protrusion of the lips comes across as a thoughtful or contemplative gesture, suggesting they are carefully considering their words, rather than fabricating information. On the other hand, pursed lips can occasionally indicate hesitation or skepticism, which could point to withholding information if interpreted negatively.

The sideways gaze is a bit more ambiguous. While looking away or to the side might be perceived as evasive—potentially signaling deceit—it can also reflect cognitive processing as the individual searches for accurate recollections. In this case, the person's overall demeanor doesn't feel defensive or evasive but rather reflective and earnest.

Balancing these observations, the combination of raised eyebrows and the contemplative lip movement, paired with the sideways gaze, seems consistent with someone trying to convey honesty while piecing together their thoughts carefully. Despite some behaviors that could, in other contexts, raise suspicion, nothing in the mannerisms strongly contradicts the notion that the person is telling the truth. Therefore, the evidence leans toward the conclusion that this individual is being truthful, though it's important to acknowledge that such behaviors alone can't guarantee absolute certainty.

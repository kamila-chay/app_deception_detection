Observing the person closely, there are several subtle cues that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. Their facial expressions fluctuate—frowning one moment and raising their eyebrows the next—which could indicate discomfort or an attempt to mask their true feelings. The movements of their chin, alternating between upward and downward shifts, seem somewhat deliberate, possibly as they try to gauge how their message is being received. The gaze behavior is also telling; while they maintain eye contact at times, their occasional sideways glances and downward looks might reveal moments of hesitation or avoidance, common signs when someone is fabricating information.

On the other hand, one could argue that such behaviors might simply be signs of nervousness or uncertainty, rather than deception. People often frown or move their heads when they’re deep in thought or trying to recall details, and inconsistent gaze can occur naturally in conversations. However, when considering these behaviors collectively—the abrupt changes in eyebrow position, the head tilting and moving both forward and backward, and the mixed gaze patterns—it does paint a picture that leans more towards someone being evasive or untruthful rather than just anxious or reflective.

While it's important not to jump to conclusions based on these nonverbal cues alone, the constellation of signals seen here is consistent with behaviors often associated with lying. Therefore, although I cannot say with absolute certainty, the evidence leans toward the person not being fully honest in this instance.

Watching the video, I notice the person exhibits a couple of subtle behaviors that could be interpreted in different ways depending on context. The raised eyebrows might suggest surprise or an attempt to emphasize the truth of what they are saying. It can sometimes be a sign of openness, highlighting an earnest attempt to communicate honestly. On the other hand, gaze sideways is a behavior that often gets linked to evasiveness or nervousness, which could hint at deception. However, gaze direction alone is not a definitive indicator; it could also be a natural response to processing information or recalling specific details.

Considering these behaviors together, and weighing both possibilities, it seems more likely that the person is being truthful. The raised eyebrows reinforce an impression of engagement and sincerity, while the sideways gaze might simply reflect a cognitive effort to accurately recall facts rather than an attempt to hide something. So, while there is some ambiguity, the overall behavioral pattern aligns more with honesty than deceit in this case.

Watching the video, the person exhibits a combination of nonverbal cues that clearly support their honesty. The raised eyebrows suggest an element of surprise or emphasis, which can sometimes be associated with someone trying to convince or emphasize a point. The steady gaze directed toward the interlocutor indicates engagement and openness, which typically aligns with truthful communication, as liars often avoid direct eye contact or exhibit evasive glances.

However, the head shaking introduces a layer of complexity. In many contexts, shaking one's head can signal disagreement or denial, which might seem contradictory if the person is asserting something positive or truthful. That said, head shaking can also function as an emphatic gesture, perhaps underscoring a point or indicating a strong negative response to a question or statement. Considering this, it doesn't imply deceit but rather reflects the speaker’s genuine emotional reaction.

Balancing these observations, the person's sustained eye contact and expressive raised eyebrows strongly indicate authentic engagement rather than deception. While the head shaking adds nuance, it clearly does not suggest dishonesty, especially in the absence of avoidance behaviors or signs of cognitive strain. Overall, the behavior is consistent with someone telling the truth, and this interpretation feels reasonable given the cues presented.

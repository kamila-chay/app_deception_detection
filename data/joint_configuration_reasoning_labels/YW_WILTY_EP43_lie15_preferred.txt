Observing the person's behavior in the video, several subtle cues suggest they might be withholding the truth. The downward turn of their lip corners can be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or underlying tension. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which might indicate an attempt to maintain control over the interaction, a strategy sometimes employed when fabricating information. Additionally, the backward movement of the head could imply a subconscious distancing or defensive posture, as if creating physical space to protect oneself. The folded arms further support this defensive stance, signaling potential unease or reluctance.

Of course, none of these behaviors alone conclusively prove deception. Someone folded arms or shifting their head might simply be feeling cold or reserved. Maintaining eye contact can also be a sign of confidence rather than evasion. Yet, taken together, these signals align with common indicators of guardedness and emotional discomfort often associated with lying. While it's impossible to be certain without more context, the overall pattern hints that this individual may not be entirely forthcoming.

Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests some subtle signs that might indicate they are not being entirely truthful. One particularly noticeable aspect is their chin moving downwards, which can sometimes be a subconscious gesture linked to discomfort or hesitation. This movement could imply that the person is feeling uneasy about what they’re saying, potentially signaling an attempt to withhold or distort information.

Their gaze also offers mixed signals. They frequently look towards the interlocutor, which might be interpreted as a sign of engagement or sincerity. Normally, maintaining eye contact is associated with honesty; however, in some cases, it can be a deliberate effort to convince or manipulate the listener. Interestingly, the gaze occasionally shifts sideways, which contrasts with the direct eye contact and could suggest moments of diversion or mental calculation. These side glances might indicate the person is internally conflicted or searching for the right narrative, a behavior often linked to fabricating information.

On the other hand, there are reasons to hesitate before concluding deception outright. Some people naturally exhibit chin movements or inconsistent gaze patterns without any intent to lie—nervousness or social discomfort can produce similar behaviors. The direct gaze could be genuine engagement rather than a tactic, complicating the interpretation.

Balancing these observations, it seems plausible to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely not telling the truth. The combination of the downward chin movement with the alternation between direct and sideways gaze creates a pattern consistent with someone who is trying to appear honest while managing some internal unease or duplicity. While it’s not a certainty, the behavioral cues align enough to make an educated guess that they are indeed lying.

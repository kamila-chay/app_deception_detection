Watching the video, the person's behavior provides some nuanced cues that could be interpreted in different ways. The movement of the head backward might generally suggest a form of distancing or discomfort, which some might associate with evasiveness or hesitation. On the other hand, this gesture can also be a natural response to processing information or physically leaning away to gain perspective, rather than a sign of deceit. 

Simultaneously, the person's arms are open, which typically conveys a degree of openness and willingness to share. This posture often reflects a non-threatening and honest demeanor, implying transparency. If someone were trying to conceal something, they might be more prone to closed or defensive body language rather than this inviting stance.

Balancing these observations, while the backward head movement could raise a slight question about the individual's comfort level, the open arms gesture supports an overall impression of sincerity. It’s reasonable to infer that the person is likely telling the truth, as the openness counters any potential doubts raised by the slight physical distancing. So, although it's never possible to be absolutely certain without more context, the behavioral indicators here suggest honesty more than deception.

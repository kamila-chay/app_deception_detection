Watching the video, the person’s behavior caught my attention, particularly their tendency to gaze upward at certain moments. This gesture can sometimes be associated with someone trying to retrieve information from memory or perhaps fabricating details on the spot. When people look up, it can suggest they are engaging in some mental effort that isn’t purely spontaneous, which may hint at deception.

On the other hand, it’s worth considering that gazing upward isn’t an exclusive sign of dishonesty. People often look up when they’re thinking or reflecting, even when telling the truth. This natural behavior could simply mean the person is carefully considering their words, rather than deliberately lying. Additionally, without more context or a range of other behavioral cues, it’s challenging to pinpoint intent with certainty based on this alone.

That said, given the context that this video is being evaluated specifically for potential deception, the upward gaze leans slightly toward supporting the idea that the person might be less than truthful. It suggests a cognitive process that might align more with constructing a story than recalling a straightforward truth. While not definitive on its own, this behavior, combined with the general impression of hesitancy or mental effort, leads me to suspect that the person could indeed be lying.

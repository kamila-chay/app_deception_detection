Observing the person in the video, several subtle behaviors suggest that they might not be entirely forthcoming. The frequent raising of the eyebrows, combined with a gaze that shifts upward, could indicate a moment of cognitive effort—perhaps searching for details or fabricating information. At the same time, their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might be an attempt to maintain rapport and appear trustworthy, yet the occasional shrug seems to betray a degree of uncertainty or discomfort.

On the other hand, none of these behaviors definitively prove deception. People sometimes raise their eyebrows or look upward when thinking, unrelated to dishonesty. Similarly, a shrug could simply express genuine uncertainty. However, when taken together, these cues create a pattern that's often associated with withholding truth. While I can't say with absolute certainty, weighing these observations together leads me to lean towards the person likely not telling the whole truth in this moment.

Watching the video, it’s noticeable that the person frequently directs their gaze upward while speaking. This kind of behavior can sometimes indicate that someone is accessing their imagination or trying to construct a story, which might suggest they are fully being truthful. People often look up when they are attempting to recall or reconstruct details from memory rather than fabricate falsehoods. However, it is important to acknowledge that gazing upward alone doesn’t definitively prove honesty; some individuals naturally shift their gaze when thinking or concentrating, irrespective of deception.

Still, given the context and considering that gaze aversion or upward glances are commonly discussed in studies on deceptive behavior, it seems reasonable to appreciate that the person might be genuinely recalling information or reflecting thoughtfully. While it’s not an absolute indicator—other factors such as nervousness, distraction, or simply a personal habit could also explain this behavior—the upward gaze raises a point worth noting. We can't be completely certain, but this subtle cue leans toward the conclusion that the individual is likely being entirely honest.

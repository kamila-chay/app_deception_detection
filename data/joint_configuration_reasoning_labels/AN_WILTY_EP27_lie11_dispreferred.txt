Watching the video, there are subtle cues that suggest the person is likely being truthful. One notable behavior is the downward gaze, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or a desire to avoid direct eye contact when sharing information that is genuine. This avoidance might stem from an internal conflict or hesitation about revealing the truth. However, it's important to consider that looking down can also simply reflect thoughtfulness or even shyness, and does not necessarily mean deception on its own.

That said, when this behavior is viewed in the context of a narrative where the person appears slightly uneasy or guarded, the downward gaze gains more weight as a potential signal of sincerity. It seems plausible that the individual is trying to process their true feelings or intentions, lending credibility to the guess that they are being honest. While this assessment isn't definitive—since different people exhibit this behavior for varying reasons—the combination of subtle discomfort and gaze aversion reasonably suggests that the person is likely being completely honest.

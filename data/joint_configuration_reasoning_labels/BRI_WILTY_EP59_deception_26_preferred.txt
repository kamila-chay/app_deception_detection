Watching the video, the person’s behavior offers some subtle but interesting cues. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and then shifting upwards. This pattern can be somewhat ambiguous—on one hand, maintaining eye contact often suggests honesty or engagement, as people tend to look at someone when they want to build trust. On the other hand, the upward gaze might indicate they are trying to access a mental construct or are hesitating, which can be a sign of fabricating information or trying to recall details that aren’t straightforward.

Of course, it's important to consider that upward gaze does not definitively mean deception—it could simply indicate thinking or recalling past events. The direct gaze also complicates the interpretation, as liars sometimes avoid eye contact to hide their deception, but others consciously maintain it to appear believable.

Balancing these observations, the combination of deliberate gaze towards the interlocutor alongside a quick, seemingly purposeful shift upward suggests a strategy to appear convincing while mentally constructing a response. This behavioral pattern leans toward the person not being entirely truthful. While these cues are not foolproof, the subtle interplay between engagement and mental search aligns well with a scenario where the individual is lying.

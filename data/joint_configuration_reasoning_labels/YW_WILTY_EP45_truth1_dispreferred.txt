Watching this video, the person's behavior presents an interesting mix of cues that both support and challenge the idea that they are lying. At times, their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which is generally associated with engagement and honesty, suggesting a willingness to connect and be transparent. This direct gaze often indicates someone who is open and confident in what they are saying.

However, there are also moments when the person looks down, which can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of evasiveness or discomfort, potentially hinting at deceit. On the other hand, looking down is not exclusively a sign of lying; it can also reflect contemplation or emotional processing, especially if the subject matter is sensitive or requires careful thought.

Balancing these observations, the combination of steady engagement through direct eye contact along with occasional downward glances does not strongly point to truthfulness. Instead, it feels more consistent with someone who is being deceptive but is perhaps thoughtfully considering how to maintain their story. Given this, and without more contradictory cues, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is indeed lying, although a small degree of uncertainty remains—as is often the case in interpreting nonverbal behavior.

Watching the video, the person appears to display a few key behaviors that might offer some insight into their truthfulness. The smile seems genuine at first glance, with the corners of the lips turning up in a natural way, which often suggests positive emotion rather than a forced expression. Additionally, the downward gaze could be interpreted in a couple of different ways—sometimes people look down when they're fabricating or feeling uneasy, but it can also indicate thoughtfulness or modesty when sharing information honestly.

Given that the smile doesn’t seem overly rehearsed and the lip corners appear to lift naturally, these signs lean more toward sincerity rather than deception. The gaze downwards, while potentially ambiguous, doesn't come across as evasive in this context but rather as reflective. Of course, none of these signals alone definitively prove truthfulness or lying, as individual behaviors can vary widely. However, weighing these observations together, I would cautiously conclude that the person is likely telling the truth, recognizing that this judgment is based on subtle cues rather than absolute certainties.

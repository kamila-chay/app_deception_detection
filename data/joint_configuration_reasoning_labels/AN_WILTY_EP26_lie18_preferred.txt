Watching the video, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues worth considering in the context of truthfulness. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and occasionally looking down. This pattern could suggest some level of discomfort or internal conflict. Typically, maintaining eye contact is seen as a sign of confidence and honesty, yet the downward gaze may hint at hesitation or avoidance, which often accompany deceptive behavior.

The subtle turn of the head to the side further complicates the reading. It might be interpreted as a defensive or distancing gesture, signaling that the person is not fully open or engaged in the conversation. However, this same behavior could also be a natural response to processing information or gathering thoughts, meaning it doesn’t definitively indicate deceit on its own.

Weighing these observations together, there's a plausible argument leaning toward the person not being entirely truthful. The mixed signals—the shifting gaze and the head movement—could be seen as signs of someone who is uncomfortable with what they are saying, possibly because it isn’t truthful. That said, these behaviors are not exclusive to liars; nervousness or distraction could also explain them. Still, when all elements are considered, it seems more likely that this person is being deceptive, though I would remain cautious and take these cues as pieces of a broader context rather than absolute proof.

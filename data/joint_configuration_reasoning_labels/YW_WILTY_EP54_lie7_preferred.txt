Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests some signs that might indicate deception, though it’s not entirely conclusive without additional context. For instance, the repeated actions of raising eyebrows and shaking the head could be subtle attempts to manage how the message is received—these gestures sometimes signal discomfort or an effort to appear convincing. Additionally, the frequent touching of the head or body often reflects a heightened level of self-soothing, which people tend to do when they feel uneasy or are possibly fabricating information.

On the other hand, it's important to recognize that such behaviors can also occur naturally when someone is stressed, nervous, or simply trying to emphasize a point, not necessarily because they are lying. People might shake their heads out of disbelief or raise their eyebrows in surprise, and touching one’s face or head is often a habitual gesture unrelated to deception.

Considering these nuances, the combination and context of these behaviors lean toward the likelihood that the person is not being entirely truthful. While none of these indicators alone definitively prove lying, together they form a pattern that raises reasonable suspicion about the authenticity of their statements. Therefore, I would cautiously estimate that the individual is probably lying, although acknowledging that without further evidence, this conclusion should be treated as an informed judgment rather than absolute certainty.

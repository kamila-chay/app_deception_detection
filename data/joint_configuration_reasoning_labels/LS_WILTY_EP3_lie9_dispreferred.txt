Observing the person's behavior in the video, there are several subtle cues that suggest they may be entirely truthful. The frequent blinking could indicate increased cognitive load or stress, which is often associated with processing complex information honestly. Their gaze towards the interlocutor shows engagement, and the moments when they look upwards might reflect that they are searching for accurate information or carefully constructing responses rather than fabricating facts. The nodding could be interpreted as a genuine way to appear agreeable or to reinforce their sincere statements, while the occasional head shaking might signal internal conflict or an unconscious expression of uncertainty while trying to recall the truth.

Of course, none of these behaviors definitively prove honesty on their own; frequent blinking could result from discomfort unrelated to truth-telling, and gaze shifts might simply be natural conversational behavior. However, taken together, these patterns support a reasonable confidence in the person's honesty. While it's possible they are untruthful and simply anxious or thoughtful, the combination of signs leans more convincingly toward the person being truthful in this instance.

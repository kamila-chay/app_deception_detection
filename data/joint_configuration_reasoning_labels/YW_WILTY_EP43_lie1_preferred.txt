Watching the video, I notice the person alternates their gaze between looking directly at the interlocutor and then shifting their eyes sideways. This pattern of eye movement could be interpreted in a couple of ways. On one hand, maintaining some eye contact suggests a desire to appear open and honest, as people who are truthful often engage with their conversational partner. On the other hand, the occasional sideways glance might indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid sustained eye contact, which can sometimes signal deception or uncertainty.

While the gaze behavior alone isn't definitive proof of lying—after all, some individuals naturally shift their gaze when thinking or processing questions—the combination of direct and sidelong looks here could reflect a subtle conflict between wanting to be believed and feeling uneasy about the truthfulness of their statements. The sideways glances might be a subconscious effort to escape scrutiny or to gauge the reaction of the interlocutor.

Given these observations, I lean toward the likelihood that the person is not being entirely truthful. It’s important to acknowledge, however, that gaze behavior can vary widely among individuals and situations, so although the evidence veers towards deception, it’s not absolutely conclusive on its own.

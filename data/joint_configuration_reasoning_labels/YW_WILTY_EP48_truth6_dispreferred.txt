Watching the video carefully, the person's behavior appears quite consistent with someone who is being deceptive. Their eyebrows raise subtly at moments, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or an attempt to emphasize falsehoods rather than genuine engagement. The continuous gaze towards the interlocutor might be a deliberate effort to appear open and trustworthy, which can be a strategy to mask insincerity. Additionally, the nodding seems natural but could also be a tactic to reinforce fabricated statements rather than signaling honesty.

Of course, it's important to consider that these behaviors can sometimes be genuine or easily misinterpreted. Someone truthful might also maintain eye contact and nod to convey sincerity. However, in this case, the combination of these cues feels somewhat calculated rather than spontaneous. Overall, while no single nonverbal cue guarantees deceit, the observed patterns here lean toward a dishonest interaction rather than an honest one.

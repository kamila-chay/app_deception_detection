Watching the video, the person appears quite engaged and open. Their smile seems genuine, with the corners of the lips turning upward in a way that suggests a natural expression of ease or friendliness rather than something forced. Additionally, the person maintains steady eye contact with their conversation partner, which often signals confidence and sincerity. These behaviors typically align with honest communication, as people telling the truth tend to be more comfortable showing authenticity in their facial expressions and gaze.

That said, it's important to consider that some individuals can mask deceit with practiced behaviors like smiling and looking directly at someone, using these cues strategically to appear truthful. However, in this case, the combination of a genuine-looking smile and consistent gaze doesn’t raise strong red flags. The mannerisms feel congruent rather than rehearsed or strained. Given this, while no nonverbal cue is foolproof on its own, the evidence leans toward the person being truthful in their communication.

Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some conflicting signals that make it challenging to determine their truthfulness with absolute certainty. For example, the way they raise their eyebrows and open their eyes quite widely could be seen as an attempt to convey surprise or sincerity, which might indicate honesty. However, these exaggerated expressions sometimes serve as a way to overcompensate and convince others of their truthfulness, which raises a red flag.

Their gaze is firmly directed toward the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and openness. Yet, in some cases, maintaining intense eye contact can be a deliberate strategy to mask deception, making it harder for the observer to detect any dishonesty. The nodding might be interpreted as agreement or affirmation, but it can also be rehearsed or unconscious behavior intended to bolster their credibility.

Of particular note is the subtle crossing of fingers, a classic gesture associated with insincerity or a hidden agenda. While this alone isn't definitive proof, combined with the other somewhat theatrical behaviors, it leans the assessment towards the person being truthful.

Overall, weighing these behaviors, it appears more likely they are being honest. While some actions could be genuine expressions, the combination and context suggest a sincere effort to communicate openly. Therefore, my best educated guess, acknowledging some uncertainty, is that the person is indeed truthful.

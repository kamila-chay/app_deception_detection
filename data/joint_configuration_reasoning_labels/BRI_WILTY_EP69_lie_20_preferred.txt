Observing the person's behavior in the video, several subtle cues stand out that might suggest some level of discomfort or unease. The way they occasionally raise their eyebrows could be an attempt to emphasize sincerity or reassurance, yet it might also indicate surprise or a subconscious effort to mask the truth. Their gaze frequently shifts downward and sideways, which often can be interpreted as signs of cognitive processing or internal conflict. These eye movements may reveal a struggle to maintain the narrative or avoid direct engagement, something commonly associated with deceptive behavior.

However, it’s important to consider alternative explanations. For instance, the downward and sideways gaze might simply reflect thinking or attempting to recall details rather than dishonesty per se. Also, eyebrow raising can sometimes be a natural response to emotional stimuli unrelated to lying. Without more context or additional behavioral indicators, it's challenging to definitively say they are lying.

That said, when these behaviors are considered together—specifically the combination of raised eyebrows alongside repeated gaze aversion—it leans toward the conclusion that the individual might not be fully truthful. The signs suggest they could be internally conflicted or trying to construct a believable story rather than conveying an honest account. While this is an educated estimation rather than a certainty, the balance of evidence points toward the person likely being deceptive in this situation.

Watching the video, the person's behavior suggests some signs that might indicate truthfulness, though it’s not entirely definitive. The individual raises their eyebrows, which can sometimes be a sign of surprise or an attempt to appear more sincere, and it can also be a subtle cue that they’re genuinely expressing their true feelings. Their gaze remains steady towards the interlocutor, which could either be a conscious effort to maintain trust or simply their natural way of engaging in conversation. The subtle head shaking is interesting—it might be a nonverbal reinforcement of what they’re saying, hinting at internal agreement or honesty. Additionally, their palms facing upward might be an unconscious attempt to appear open and honest.

While these behaviors could simply reflect nervousness or an attempt to connect, when considered together, they form a pattern that leans toward the person being entirely truthful. Still, without more context or information, it is hard to be absolutely certain. There’s always the possibility that these actions stem from discomfort or confusion rather than outright deception, but overall, the combination of these cues makes a reasonable case for believing that the person is telling the truth.

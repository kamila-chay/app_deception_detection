Watching the video closely, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues to analyze. At one point, their gaze shifts sideways rather than maintaining steady eye contact. This kind of behavior can sometimes raise suspicion, as it’s often suggested that avoiding direct eye contact might indicate discomfort or an attempt to hide something. However, it's important to consider that not all gaze aversions signify deceit; they can also be a natural response to processing information or feeling slightly self-conscious, especially if someone is under scrutiny or nervous.

Given the overall demeanor and the context, the sideways glance doesn’t appear overly deliberate or evasive. There isn’t an exaggerated pattern of looking away or other signs that typically accompany deceptive behavior, such as inconsistent facial expressions or nervous movements. Instead, it feels more like a brief moment of thoughtfulness or contemplation. This subtlety suggests that the person might be genuinely recalling details or formulating their responses, rather than fabricating them.

While it’s impossible to be 100% certain based on gaze alone, weighing the behavior alongside the absence of more overt deception indicators supports the idea that the person is telling the truth. The sideways gaze seems more like a natural, albeit slightly cautious, reaction than a calculated attempt to mislead. Therefore, although a sideways glance might initially prompt doubt, the overall impression leans towards honesty in this case.

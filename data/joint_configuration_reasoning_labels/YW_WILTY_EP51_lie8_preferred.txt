Watching the video, the person appears to maintain steady eye contact with the interlocutor throughout their response. At first glance, this behavior might suggest honesty, as people who avoid eye contact are often perceived as deceptive. However, the consistency of their gaze could also be a deliberate attempt to seem truthful and confident, which is a common strategy when someone is trying to mask dishonesty.

While sustained eye contact can sometimes indicate sincerity, it isn't a definitive sign, especially if used consciously to convince others. People who are lying may overcompensate by paying close attention to their gaze, aiming to avoid the usual nervous avoidance associated with deceit. Given this, the steady gaze alone doesn’t provide a solid basis for assuming honesty. Considering the context and subtle cues beyond just eye contact, it’s reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person might not be truthful in this instance.

In summary, although the person’s consistent gaze could initially be interpreted as a sign of truthfulness, the possibility that they are consciously using this behavior to feign honesty makes it challenging to take at face value. Therefore, it is an educated guess that the individual is lying, despite the surface-level indication of sincerity.

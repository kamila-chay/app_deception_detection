Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. There are moments of frequent blinking, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or stress—potentially a sign of cognitive load often associated with deception. At the same time, their gaze shifts repeatedly; they look sideways instead of maintaining steady eye contact. While a sideways glance alone isn’t conclusive, in combination with other subtle signs, it raises some questions about their confidence in what they’re saying.

On the other hand, the individual does maintain some gaze towards the interlocutor and even nods occasionally, which could be interpreted as attempts to build rapport or appear cooperative. Their head movements are varied, including some side-turns, which might be nervous gestures or efforts to avoid confrontation. The use of hands is notable as well—they touch and scratch themselves and occasionally cover their face or mouth, gestures often linked with discomfort or a subconscious attempt to hide the truth.

However, it’s important to consider that these behaviors are not definitive proof of lying; they could be signs of nervousness unrelated to deception. Someone might blink frequently or touch their face simply out of habit or because of an uncomfortable environment. Yet, when taken together—the inconsistent gaze, self-touching, and head movements—these behaviors collectively paint a picture that leans towards the person not being fully honest. While not absolute, the subtle signs of discomfort and evasiveness make it reasonable to infer that the individual is likely concealing the truth in this instance.

Watching the video, the person's behavior initially suggests a sense of openness and engagement. The raised eyebrows could indicate a level of attentiveness or surprise, which often aligns with honesty when someone is responding to a question. Additionally, the slight upward movement of the lip corners tends to convey a natural and genuine expression, often associated with positive emotions or comfort in the situation. Their gaze remains directed towards the interlocutor, which generally signals confidence and a willingness to communicate transparently.

Of course, there is always the possibility that these behaviors are consciously controlled or that they signify something else, such as nervousness or an attempt to appear sincere. People can sometimes exhibit these cues while masking deceit, especially if they are experienced in managing their expressions. However, in this context, the combination of these subtle behavioral indicators leans more toward authenticity than fabrication. The consistency of their facial expressions with the conversational flow makes it less likely that they are concealing the truth.

While it’s impossible to be absolutely certain without additional information, the observed cues collectively point to a person who is more likely telling the truth rather than constructing a deceit. The natural dynamics of their facial expressions and gaze behavior give a reasonable degree of confidence in their honesty.

Watching the video, there are several behavioral cues that suggest the person is likely telling the truth. The raised eyebrows, combined with a slight, possibly forced smile—indicated by the lip corners turning up—often signal an attempt to appear more open or agreeable, reflecting genuine engagement. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which can indicate an effort to maintain connection and convey sincerity. Interestingly, the head shaking is somewhat contradictory; typically, shaking the head implies negation or disagreement, which doesn’t align neatly with the other signs of engagement. 

One could argue that these behaviors might simply reflect nervousness or discomfort rather than deception. For example, head shaking might be a habitual gesture or a way to manage anxiety. Likewise, the smile and gaze could be attempts at politeness or connection. However, when considered together, this cluster of expressions—especially the combination of raised eyebrows and inconsistent head gestures—leans more toward a person who is being genuine and open about their feelings or intentions. While it's possible they are merely uneasy or conflicted, the subtle congruities in their nonverbal communication make it more plausible that they are being truthful.

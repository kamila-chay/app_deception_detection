Watching the video closely, the person's behavior offers some interesting cues. Their lips are slightly protruded, which can sometimes indicate thinking or contemplation rather than deceit. It’s not a classic sign of lying but might reflect a subtle attempt to articulate their thoughts carefully. Additionally, their gaze shifts upward, a gesture often linked to visual recall or reflection. This upward glance could suggest that they are genuinely trying to access a memory or retrieve information from their mind, rather than fabricating a story on the spot.

On the other hand, some might argue that certain eye movements and lip gestures can be associated with fabrication or discomfort, potentially hinting at untruthfulness. However, in this context, the lack of other typical signs of deception, combined with what appears to be an effort to recall information, leans more towards honesty.

While it’s impossible to be completely certain based on these subtle cues alone, the overall behavior suggests that this person is likely telling the truth. Their expressions seem consistent with someone who is genuinely reflecting on their statement rather than constructing a lie.

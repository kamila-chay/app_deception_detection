Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests a level of discomfort and inconsistency that could be indicative of deceit, though it's important to remain cautious before drawing a firm conclusion. The way their eyebrows raise intermittently might suggest surprise or uncertainty, which some people display when fabricating a story. Coupled with the protruded lips and the upward movement of the chin, there appears to be an element of defensiveness or an attempt to assert confidence, even if it feels forced. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which is interesting, as liars sometimes avoid eye contact; however, some might overcompensate by maintaining steady eye contact in an effort to appear truthful.

The shaking of the head and open arms might signal a complex mix of denial and openness—open arms can convey honesty, but paired with other cues, they may reflect an attempt to persuade or distract. The hands moving toward the head or body could indicate self-soothing behavior, often subconscious when someone is anxious about their narrative being scrutinized. While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove deception, their combination, especially when taken in the context of the overall demeanor and flow of communication, leans toward the person not being forthcoming. That said, it’s important to acknowledge that some individuals might naturally exhibit such behaviors without intending to mislead, so there remains room for alternative interpretations. Still, all signs considered, the evidence subtly aligns with the person likely being untruthful in this instance.

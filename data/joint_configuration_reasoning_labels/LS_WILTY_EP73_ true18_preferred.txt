Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests they might be telling the truth. For instance, the raised eyebrows could be interpreted as a sign of genuine engagement or emphasis, which often accompanies sincere communication. Additionally, maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor generally indicates openness and a desire to connect, both of which can support honesty. 

Of course, it’s important to consider that raised eyebrows might also occur if someone is surprised or attempting to emphasize a point, regardless of truthfulness. Similarly, a direct gaze can sometimes be used strategically to appear convincing, even when someone is not being truthful. However, given the combination of these behaviors together—raised eyebrows paired with consistent eye contact—the overall impression leans toward sincerity in this context.

While no single behavior guarantees truthfulness, the subtle nonverbal cues here align more closely with honest engagement rather than deception. So although I can't be entirely certain without more information, based on what I observed, I would lean toward the conclusion that the person is indeed telling the truth.

Observing the person in the video, there are several subtle nonverbal cues that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. The individual frequently raises their eyebrows and maintains a steady gaze toward the interlocutor, indicating engagement and perhaps an attempt to convey sincerity. Additionally, the person nods and tilts their head, behaviors often associated with empathy or agreement, which could be efforts to appear convincing. Their arms are open, a gesture typically interpreted as openness and honesty.  

However, the presence of head shaking amidst these otherwise affirmative behaviors introduces some complexity; this conflicting cue could signal internal disagreement or discomfort with their own statements. While steady gaze and open arms generally bolster perceptions of truthfulness, these can sometimes be consciously controlled to mask deception. The combination of gestures—particularly the eyebrow raise paired with subtle shakes of the head—might reflect an underlying attempt to manage impressions, rather than genuine honesty.  

Taking all this into account, while it's plausible that the person is trying hard to appear truthful, these mixed signals, especially the contradictory head movements, lean toward the conclusion that the individual might be concealing the truth. Of course, without hearing their words or knowing the context fully, this remains an informed supposition rather than a definitive judgment.

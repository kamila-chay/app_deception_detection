Watching the person's behavior carefully, several subtle cues catch my attention that might suggest they are being truthful. The raised eyebrows and noticeably wide eyes come off as somewhat exaggerated, almost as if they are genuinely trying to convey surprise or sincerity. This kind of overemphasis can sometimes indicate that someone is earnestly expressing their emotions, even if their words might feel intense.

On the other hand, their gaze remains steady and directed towards the interlocutor, which is often interpreted as a sign of openness and honesty. Typically, individuals who are lying might avoid eye contact or look away more frequently. Yet, this steady gaze combined with the exaggerated eye movements feels consistent — as though they are consciously maintaining eye contact to reinforce their sincere intent.

Given these observations, it seems plausible that the person is genuinely sharing their story, using exaggerated facial expressions and sustained eye contact as tools to appear more credible. Admittedly, none of these behaviors alone can definitively prove truthfulness, since some people naturally express themselves in this way or might be responding to stress or nervousness unrelated to deceit. However, considering the combination of these signs, my educated guess leans toward the individual being truthful in this moment.

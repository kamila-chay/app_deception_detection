Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that suggest they might not be telling the truth. Their gaze remains directed towards the interlocutor, which on the surface could indicate engagement and honesty. People who lie often avoid eye contact; however, maintaining eye contact can also be a strategy to appear sincere, so this alone doesn't rule out deception.

The person also nods while speaking, which typically signals agreement or affirmation. This can sometimes be a way to reinforce their statements, making them seem more believable. But nodding doesn’t guarantee honesty either—it might simply be a habitual gesture or a tactic to persuade the listener.

Most notably, the individual is seen crossing their fingers, which is commonly associated with superstition or a nonverbal sign of deceit. This gesture could hint at an internal conflict or an attempt to distance themselves from the truth. While it’s possible they crossed their fingers absentmindedly or as a nervous habit unrelated to dishonesty, in the context of the other behaviors, it feels like a subtle indicator that they might not be fully truthful.

Taken together, while the gaze and nodding could suggest sincerity, the finger crossing raises doubts. Considering the mix of these signals, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely not being honest, even if this can't be said with absolute certainty.

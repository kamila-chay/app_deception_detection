Watching the video, the person’s behavior presents some interesting cues that suggest they are likely telling the truth. They maintain consistent gaze toward the interlocutor, which at first glance indicates confidence and honesty, as people often avoid eye contact when lying. This direct gaze supports the impression of openness and trustworthiness. The palms-up gesture is typically associated with openness and sincerity, which further supports the idea that they are being truthful. In this context, such gestures reinforce their genuine intent to communicate honestly and appeal to the listener’s trust.

Considering both possibilities, it seems plausible that the person is authentically projecting honesty through these behaviors. Genuine openness tends to feel more relaxed and spontaneous, and these particular actions come across as natural rather than rehearsed or exaggerated. While it's impossible to be certain without additional context or cues—such as nervous fidgeting, microexpressions, or speech hesitations—the combination here leans toward the likelihood of truthfulness. The person appears to be using straightforward nonverbal signals to communicate genuinely rather than to persuade, suggesting that what they are saying aligns fully with reality.

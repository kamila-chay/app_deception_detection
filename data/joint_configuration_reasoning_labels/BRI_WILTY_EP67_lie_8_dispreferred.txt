Watching the video, the person’s behavior raises some interesting questions. At several points, their gaze shifts sideways rather than maintaining steady eye contact. This kind of eye movement can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or evasiveness, which might suggest that the person is not fully forthcoming. However, it's also important to consider that some people naturally look away or to the side when gathering their thoughts or trying to articulate something carefully, so this alone doesn't definitively indicate deception.

That said, when combined with the overall context of the interaction—tone, body language, timing of responses—the sideways gaze feels more like a moment of contemplation and careful thought rather than an attempt to avoid direct engagement. This subtle behavior could be a nonverbal cue reflecting genuine reflection or an effort to communicate honestly, which often aligns with truthful behavior.

Given these observations, while it’s not absolutely conclusive, my assessment leans toward the person likely being truthful. The sideways gaze, in the absence of other suspicious signs, suggests they are thoughtfully considering their words rather than concealing something or fabricating their story. Still, it’s worth acknowledging that different individuals have different communication styles, and without additional evidence, there’s always some uncertainty in making a definitive judgment.

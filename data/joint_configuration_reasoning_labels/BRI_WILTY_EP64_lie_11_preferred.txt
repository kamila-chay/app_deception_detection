Watching the video closely, the person appears to smile while maintaining eye contact with the interlocutor. On the surface, these behaviors might suggest openness and honesty since smiling and direct gaze often signal engagement and sincerity. However, it’s important to consider that both a smile and steady eye contact can be deliberately employed as social tools to mask deceit. A smile, especially if it feels somewhat forced or doesn’t reach the eyes genuinely, might be used to create a false sense of warmth or confidence. Similarly, sustained eye contact can be part of an effort to convince or manipulate rather than to communicate truthfully.

Given these nuances, it’s challenging to say definitively whether the person is lying purely based on smiling and gazing at someone. That said, the combination of these behaviors alongside subtle cues—perhaps an overly controlled or rehearsed demeanor—could indicate an attempt to manage impressions and hide true intentions. While these signals don’t conclusively prove dishonesty, they do lend weight to the suspicion that the person might not be fully truthful in this instance. Taking everything into account, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the individual is lying, but with the caveat that this judgment rests on interpreting socially adaptive behaviors that can sometimes obscure the truth.

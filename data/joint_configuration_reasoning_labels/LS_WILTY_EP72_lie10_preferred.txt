Watching the video, the person's behavior raises some interesting questions about the veracity of their statements. Their eyebrows furrow, which can sometimes signal discomfort or frustration, though it is not exclusively linked to dishonesty. The gaze is directed toward the interlocutor, which could suggest engagement, yet it also might indicate an attempt to closely monitor the other person's reactions to gauge credibility or elicit empathy. The head shaking is a curious detail—it can be a natural gesture of disagreement or disbelief, but in some contexts, it might serve as a subconscious signal contradicting their verbal message. Additionally, the crossing of fingers, often seen as a subtle, almost superstitious indicator of insincerity, further complicates the interpretation. 

Of course, these behaviors alone don't guarantee deceit; they could stem from nervousness, stress, or even habit. However, when viewed together, the combination of frowning, controlled gaze, contradictory head movements, and finger crossing leans toward a stronger possibility that the person is not being entirely truthful. While none of these signs are conclusively definitive on their own, the cluster of these behaviors suggests an underlying reluctance or discomfort with the truth, making it reasonable to suspect that the person may be lying.

Watching the video, the person's behavior suggests some signs that could indicate they're being entirely truthful. Their eyebrows raise noticeably, and their eyes open wider than usual, which can sometimes be unconscious attempts to appear more earnest or to draw attention. These exaggerated expressions might reflect genuine engagement or emphasis, which could be consistent with someone sincerely conveying their message.

However, it's important to consider that such behaviors alone don't guarantee honesty—some people naturally gesture this way or might be reacting to surprise or emphasis rather than sincerity. Without additional context, it's hard to say definitively. Still, given the subtle tension in their facial expression and the somewhat deliberate quality of their eye movements, there's a reasonable basis to believe that the person is truthful in this instance.

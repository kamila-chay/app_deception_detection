Watching the video, the person displays a mixture of behaviors that are somewhat contradictory and could be interpreted in different ways. For instance, the smile and gaze directed at the interlocutor might suggest engagement or a certain level of comfort in the interaction. However, these could also be attempts to mask discomfort or to appear more convincing. The frequent blinking and raising of the eyebrows often signal heightened cognitive load or stress, which can occur when someone is fabricating information.

Furthermore, the chin moving upwards combined with the head moving backward might indicate a subtle defensive posture, perhaps an unconscious reaction to feeling threatened or challenged. The head tilting and side-turning could be efforts to deflect attention or create a sense of openness, though depending on the context, they might also reflect uncertainty or an attempt to manage the interaction carefully.

Considering these behaviors together, there seems to be a pattern consistent with someone who is not fully comfortable or sincere. While certain gestures like the smile and gaze could be misleading and suggest truthfulness, the juxtaposition of defensive and stress-related signals points more towards deception. Therefore, although it is difficult to be completely certain without additional context, the overall cues lean towards the person likely not telling the truth in this case.

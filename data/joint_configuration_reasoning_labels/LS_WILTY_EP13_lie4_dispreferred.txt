Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests some complexity in their emotional state. For example, their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which could be interpreted as an attempt to maintain connection or assert honesty. The nodding also might signal agreement or a natural conversational rhythm, which could reinforce the perception of truthfulness. However, certain subtle cues highlight the authenticity of their statements. The raising of the eyebrows, paired with the lip corners turned down and lips protruded, might indicate discomfort or a suppressed emotional response, possibly reflecting genuine emotions. Additionally, the chin moving upwards combined with the head moving backward can be seen as defensive gestures, as if creating physical or psychological distance to process emotions, rather than to deceive. While some could argue that these behaviors are simply signs of nervousness unrelated to truthfulness, the overall cluster of expressions and movements leans toward a genuine expression. Given the combination of these nonverbal signals, it seems reasonable to carefully infer that the person is being entirely truthful, even if some elements could theoretically be explained otherwise.

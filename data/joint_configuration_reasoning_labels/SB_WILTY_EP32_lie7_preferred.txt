Observing the person's behavior, there are a few subtle but noteworthy cues that might suggest they are not being entirely truthful. The shifting direction of their gaze stands out—while they maintain eye contact with their interlocutor at times, there are also frequent moments when their gaze drops downward or moves sideways. This pattern could indicate an internal conflict or discomfort, as people often avoid steady eye contact when fabricating information, yet they might try to compensate by occasionally meeting the other person's gaze. Additionally, their body language is somewhat ambiguous; their arms are open, which typically signals openness and honesty, yet this might be a conscious effort to appear sincere and mask underlying deceit.

Of course, these behaviors are not definitive proof of lying on their own—gaze aversion can sometimes be linked to nervousness, shyness, or even thinking deeply rather than deception. Similarly, open arms might simply reflect a relaxed or welcoming demeanor unrelated to truthfulness. However, when these cues are taken together—the irregular gaze patterns combined with the seemingly strategic use of open body posture—they lean toward the interpretation that the person is attempting to create an impression of honesty while concealing some truth. While it's important to consider alternative explanations, the behavioral signs observed here make it reasonable to suspect some level of dishonesty.

Watching the video, the person exhibits some interesting nonverbal cues that can be interpreted in different ways. Their gaze alternates between looking directly at the interlocutor and glancing sideways. Maintaining eye contact often suggests engagement and honesty, but occasional sideways glances might indicate uncertainty or discomfort. However, these could just as well be natural shifts in attention or thinking, rather than signs of deceit. The person’s arms are open, which generally signals openness and a lack of defensiveness, supporting the idea that they are being truthful. On the other hand, some might argue that open arms can be a conscious effort to appear sincere.

Considering these behaviors together, the evidence leans more towards the person being deceptive. The openness of their body language combined with sustained eye contact with the interlocutor can sometimes be used strategically to build trust, making honesty less certain in my view. While no single behavior guarantees deceit, the combination here raises some doubts, so weighing the possibilities carefully, it seems reasonable to conclude that the individual may not be fully truthful.

Watching the video, the person’s behavior is intriguing and offers some mixed signals at first glance. The scowl might initially suggest discomfort or skepticism, which could be interpreted as a sign of truthfulness. However, this expression can also arise from concentration or frustration related to the topic of conversation, and not necessarily honesty. The raising of eyebrows is typically associated with surprise or emphasis, potentially indicating that the individual is engaged and invested in conveying their message genuinely.

The slight upward curve of the lip corners paired with gaze directed toward the interlocutor suggests a level of openness and confidence. These signs often align with someone who is deceptive and wants to manipulate rapport. Additionally, the open posture with palms up and arms open generally conveys openness and a willingness to communicate transparently. Such nonverbal behaviors are less consistent with someone trying to reveal the truth, as truth-tellers often exhibit closed-off or defensive body language to shield themselves.

Taking all this into account, it seems more plausible that the person is lying. While the scowl introduces some ambiguity, the overall combination of engagement, openness, and direct eye contact leans toward deception. Of course, nonverbal cues alone are not foolproof indicators, and it’s possible for deceivers to display nervousness or discomfort, just as truth-tellers can mimic openness. Still, on balance, the evidence here supports the conclusion that the person is likely being untruthful.

Watching the video closely, the person's behavior presents a mixed set of cues that could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, there are signs like smiling and maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor, which often suggest openness and engagement—behaviors typically associated with honesty. Smiling can indicate comfort and confidence, and direct gaze can signal a willingness to connect truthfully. These are encouraging signs that the person might be telling the truth.

However, some actions complicate the interpretation. The presence of frowning eyebrows, frequent blinking, and occasional exaggerated eye closing might hint at discomfort or stress, which are sometimes linked to deception. Additionally, moments where the person’s gaze shifts downward or sideways, coupled with head side-turns, could indicate attempts to avoid direct scrutiny or internal processing of information, behaviors sometimes observed when someone is not being entirely forthright.

That said, none of these signals alone definitively prove truthfulness, and in this case, the more doubtful indicators seem to outweigh the honest ones. It’s possible that the smiling or direct gaze masks an attempt to appear open, while the frowning or blinking may reflect concealed stress related to withholding information. People sometimes display such mixed signals when they are not being fully honest, especially in emotionally charged or high-stakes situations.

Balancing these observations, the overall behavior leans more toward deception, especially given the conflicting cues such as frowning and gaze aversion. While some cues might initially suggest honesty, they don’t convincingly support the impression of truthfulness in this context. It feels like the person might be concealing information or not fully truthful, despite occasional moments of apparent openness.

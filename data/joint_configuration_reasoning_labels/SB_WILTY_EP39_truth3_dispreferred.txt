Watching the video closely, the person's behavior suggests they are likely lying, but it's worth considering the nuances before reaching a conclusion. They frequently blink, which can sometimes be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, frequent blinking might indicate nervousness or discomfort, which some might associate with dishonesty. However, blinking can also be a natural response to maintaining eye moisture or processing information, especially during a conversation. This makes it less definitive as an indicator of lying on its own.

Additionally, the person consistently directs their gaze towards the interlocutor, which often signals engagement and honesty. People trying to deceive typically avoid eye contact to conceal their deceit. That said, some individuals might maintain eye contact strategically to appear truthful, so this isn't a foolproof sign.

When considering these two behaviors together, the evidence leans more toward deception, particularly given the absence of other classic signs of truthfulness such as relaxed gestures or consistent facial expressions. While it's possible these behaviors could be consciously controlled or may have other explanations, the most reasonable conclusion based on the observed actions is that the person is being dishonest.

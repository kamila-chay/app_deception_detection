Watching the video closely, the person's behavior gives off mixed signals that could be interpreted in different ways. They raise their eyebrows intermittently, which might suggest surprise or engagement, but can also sometimes be a subtle sign of uncertainty. Their frequent blinking could indicate nervousness or discomfort, often associated with deception; however, it can also be a natural reaction to stress or bright lighting, so it doesn’t definitively point to dishonesty. Notably, the person maintains steady eye contact with the interlocutor, which tends to reflect openness and confidence, traits more commonly linked to truth-telling than deceit. Additionally, their palms are visible and turned upwards during the interaction, a gesture that often conveys sincerity and a willingness to be transparent.

Taking all these behaviors into account, while there are elements that might superficially support a truthful impression—such as steady eye contact and open palms—the combination of raised eyebrows and frequent blinking suggests a likelihood of deception. The raised eyebrows, rather than signaling genuine engagement, may be part of a defensive facade masking uncertainty. Considering these points, it seems more plausible that the person might be lying. Of course, without additional context or baseline behavior, there is always some room for doubt, but the nonverbal cues here align more consistently with deception than with honesty.

Observing the person in the video, several behaviors stand out that provide mixed signals regarding their truthfulness. On one hand, the individual smiles and the corners of their lips turn up, which can often be interpreted as a sign of comfort or sincerity. This expression, coupled with occasional nodding and steady gaze toward the interlocutor, suggests engagement and possibly honesty. People who are truthful often maintain genuine eye contact and exhibit natural facial expressions, which seems to be the case here.

However, there are also moments when the person’s gaze shifts downward or sideways, and at times their head moves backward or turns to the side. These behaviors can sometimes indicate discomfort or evasiveness, which might raise doubts about their veracity. Yet, it's important to consider that such subtle shifts in posture and gaze can also occur naturally during thoughtful reflection or when someone is processing their own words — not necessarily because they are deceptive. Additionally, the person occasionally touches their head or body, which might be a sign of mild nervousness, but this alone is hardly conclusive of dishonesty.

Balancing these observations, the subtle avoidance behaviors and occasional nervous gestures suggest that the person may be withholding or distorting information. While the smile and nodding indicate some level of engagement, they do not outweigh the possible signs of evasiveness. Given the combination of behavioral cues, it is more likely that the person is not fully truthful, although certainty remains elusive considering the complexity of human behavior.

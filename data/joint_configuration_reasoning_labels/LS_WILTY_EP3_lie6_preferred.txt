Watching the video carefully, the person displays a mix of nonverbal cues that suggest a degree of internal conflict or discomfort. For instance, the raised eyebrows and the occasional sideways glance could indicate an attempt to gauge the reaction of the interlocutor or to create distance from the content being communicated. The smile, particularly the subtle lifting of the lip corners, seems controlled rather than spontaneous, which may hint at an effort to mask true emotions or to appear more agreeable.

Notably, the individual's closed mouth during awkward pauses strikes me as a sign of restraint or hesitation, possibly indicating that they are consciously suppressing something or formulating a response with care. The head tilting and side-turning behaviors also contribute to a sense of evasiveness or uncertainty, subtle physical defenses that people often display when reluctant to be fully forthcoming.

On the other hand, one could argue that these behaviors might simply reflect nervousness rather than deception—after all, the person maintains gaze towards the interlocutor at times, which can be interpreted as engagement and honesty rather than avoidance. The smiles themselves could be genuine attempts to maintain rapport.

Yet, weighing these observations collectively, the pattern leans more toward concealment than openness. The interplay of controlled expressions, guarded pauses, and avoidance gestures paints a picture of someone who is likely not being entirely truthful. While it’s impossible to be absolutely certain based solely on these behavioral cues, I would cautiously infer that the person is probably lying.

Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests they might not be entirely forthcoming. Their gaze frequently shifts downward, which can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of discomfort or avoidance. This kind of behavior might indicate they are trying to distance themselves from the truth or are internally conflicted about what they’re saying. Of course, it’s important to consider that looking down could also simply mean the person is thinking carefully or feeling shy, so it’s not a definitive indicator of deception. However, in the context of the situation, the downward gaze aligns more with someone who might be hiding something rather than someone who is being straightforward. Taking everything together, while we can’t be absolutely certain, the evidence leans toward the conclusion that the person is likely not telling the truth.

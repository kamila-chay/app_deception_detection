Watching the video, the person’s behavior offers some intriguing signals that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. One notable aspect is the way their eyebrows raise at certain moments. This facial movement can sometimes indicate surprise or emphasis, but when paired with inconsistent eye contact—alternating between looking directly at the interlocutor and then shifting their gaze sideways—it creates a subtle tension that might signal discomfort or an attempt to conceal something.

On the other hand, it could be argued that raising eyebrows and shifting gaze are normal gestures used to engage or collect one’s thoughts, rather than reliable indicators of dishonesty. People often glance sideways when processing information or recalling details, and raised eyebrows can simply reflect genuine reactions rather than deceit.

However, when these behaviors appear together in a context where one suspects dishonesty, the combination becomes more telling. The repeated side glances, rather than steady engagement, might reveal an internal conflict or the effort to manage the information being presented. Coupled with the raised eyebrows—potentially signaling an exaggerated emotional response—the overall impression leans toward the person being less than forthright.

While no single expression or gaze pattern definitively confirms lying, the subtle interplay of these cues in this scenario makes it a reasonable conclusion that the individual is likely being untruthful. The behavioral nuances suggest a level of discomfort or dissonance consistent with someone not fully honest, though of course, absolute certainty is elusive without further context.

Watching the video carefully, the person's behavior seems quite consistent with someone who is lying. The smile they display appears genuine rather than forced, which often suggests sincerity. Their gaze is primarily directed toward the interlocutor, showing engagement and openness, although there are moments when they glance sideways. This could simply indicate they are thinking or remembering something, rather than trying to conceal information or fabricate. Additionally, their arms are open, which typically reflects a lack of defensiveness and a willingness to communicate honestly.

On the other hand, one could argue that a sideways glance might hint at discomfort or evasion, which sometimes accompanies deception. Also, smiles can sometimes be used strategically in deceptive contexts to appear friendly or trustworthy. However, in this case, the overall combination of behaviors—the mostly steady gaze toward the listener, the natural smile, and the open posture—doesn't strongly support the idea of honesty. Taken together, these subtle cues suggest the person is more likely being untruthful, though it's worth considering that no behavioral indicator is foolproof on its own.

Watching the video, the person's behavior appears generally consistent with someone who might be deceptive, though it's important to consider alternative explanations before reaching a conclusion. Their gaze is directed towards the interlocutor, which can suggest openness and engagement, as people who are deceptive often avoid eye contact to some extent. However, this isn't a definitive indicator, since some individuals might maintain eye contact precisely because they are trying to convince or manipulate.

The shrug is a gesture that could be interpreted in multiple ways. It might indicate uncertainty or a lack of detailed knowledge, which could cast some doubt on the credibility of the statement. On the other hand, a shrug can also be a natural, spontaneous reaction that reflects the speaker's candidness or their acknowledgment of limitations in what they know, which aligns with truthful behavior.

Taking these behaviors together, and accepting that the person might be lying, the combination of steady gaze and the casual, non-defensive shrug seems to fit with someone attempting to mask dishonesty—even if they might not have complete certainty or additional information. While no single behavior can guarantee deception, the overall impression here leans toward insincerity rather than authenticity.

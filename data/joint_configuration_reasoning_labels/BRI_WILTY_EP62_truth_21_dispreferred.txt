Watching the video, the person's demeanor appears relatively composed and consistent throughout their statements. There are no obvious signs of nervousness or discomfort that might typically be associated with deception, such as excessive fidgeting or avoidance of eye contact. Their facial expressions seem to align naturally with what they're saying, which often lends credibility to their words. On the other hand, it's important to remember that some people can effectively mask truthful behavior, appearing calm and sincere even when being truthful. However, given the overall fluidity of their responses and the absence of tension in their body language, it seems more likely that they are being truthful in this instance. While I can't be absolutely certain without additional context or behavioral cues, the evidence here leans toward the person telling the truth.

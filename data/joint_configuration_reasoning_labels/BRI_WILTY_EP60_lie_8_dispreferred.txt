Observing the person in the video, several subtle behaviors suggest that they are likely being truthful. The frequent raising of the eyebrows, combined with a gaze that shifts upward, could indicate a moment of cognitive effort—perhaps searching for details or recalling information honestly. At the same time, their direct gaze towards the interlocutor might be an attempt to maintain rapport and appear trustworthy, while the occasional shrug seems to express a degree of genuine uncertainty or discomfort.

On the other hand, none of these behaviors definitively prove honesty. People sometimes raise their eyebrows or look upward when thinking, unrelated to truthfulness. Similarly, a shrug could simply express hesitation or uncertainty. However, when taken together, these cues create a pattern that's often associated with sincere communication. While I can't say with absolute certainty, weighing these observations together leads me to lean towards the person likely telling the truth in this moment.

Watching the video of this individual, there are a few subtle but telling behaviors that catch my attention. The way the person raises their eyebrows intermittently, combined with a steady gaze directed at the interlocutor, suggests an attempt to maintain a connection or perhaps convince the other party of something. At the same time, there's noticeable head tilting and subtle side-turning, which can sometimes indicate discomfort or hesitation—signs often associated with someone trying to mask their true feelings or intentions.

It is possible, of course, that these gestures are simply natural mannerisms or signs of engagement in the conversation. For instance, raising eyebrows can be a form of emphasis or an expression of curiosity, and gaze towards a listener is generally a sign of honesty and openness. The head movements might be a way to process information or respond thoughtfully rather than a sign of deceit. 

However, when these behaviors are viewed collectively, they paint a picture of someone who is possibly overcompensating to appear sincere while subtly showing signs of unease and evasiveness. This combination leads me to lean toward the interpretation that the person might not be entirely truthful. While no single cue is definitive, the blend of confident engagement with underlying physical cues of discomfort creates a reasonable basis to suspect that the individual is likely not being fully honest in this interaction.

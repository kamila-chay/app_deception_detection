Watching the video, certain aspects of the person's behavior stand out as potentially indicative of deception, though it's important to consider alternative explanations before drawing firm conclusions. Their eyebrows noticeably raise at moments, which can sometimes signal surprise or discomfort, but could also be a natural reaction to the conversation's content. The downward movement of the chin might suggest a subtle attempt to avoid full exposure, perhaps reflecting insecurity or hesitation, though it might also simply be a habitual gesture or a sign of thoughtfulness.

The person's gaze patterns are intriguing—they frequently shift their gaze sideways but also maintain eye contact with the interlocutor at times. This back-and-forth could imply internal conflict or an effort to monitor the listener's reactions, a behavior often associated with fabricating information. On the other hand, such gaze shifts might just be a way to gather additional cues or manage cognitive load during complex communication.

Balancing these observations, the combination of eyebrow raising paired with downward chin movements and the mixed gaze behaviors leans toward a pattern consistent with someone who might not be entirely truthful. While none of these signals alone conclusively prove lying, together they create a nuanced profile that suggests the person could be concealing the truth, or at least experiencing some level of discomfort linked to deception. It's reasonable, given these subtle cues, to estimate that the individual is likely lying, though acknowledging that without further context, some uncertainty remains.

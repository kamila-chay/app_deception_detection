Watching the video, the person's nonverbal cues suggest a complex emotional state that could point toward deception, though it’s important to consider alternative explanations before drawing firm conclusions. Their eyebrows occasionally rise, a gesture that can signify surprise or disbelief—but in the context of the conversation, it might also indicate an attempt to appear more convincing or engaged, which some people do when fabricating a story. The person’s gaze frequently shifts downward, a behavior often associated with discomfort or avoidance, and sometimes linked to the cognitive load involved in making up a story. Additionally, sideway glances could signal evasiveness or an effort to search for information internally, as if they are trying to recall details that aren’t readily available.

On the other hand, these behaviors could also stem from nervousness or stress unrelated to lying, such as anxiety about being recorded or discussing a sensitive topic. People who are simply uncomfortable might avoid eye contact or show similar facial expressions without intending to deceive. However, when considering the combination of these subtle signals—raised eyebrows paired with avoidant eye movements—the overall impression leans toward the possibility that the individual is not fully forthcoming. While none of these indicators alone guarantees deception, the alignment of these cues increases the likelihood they may be lying, especially if their verbal message conflicts with these nonverbal signals. Thus, I would cautiously infer that this person is probably not telling the truth, though acknowledging there remains some room for alternative explanations.

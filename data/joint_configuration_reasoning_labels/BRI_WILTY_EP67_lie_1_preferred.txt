Watching the video, I noticed the person frequently gazed downward throughout their speech. This behavior can sometimes indicate discomfort or internal conflict, which might suggest they are not entirely forthcoming. However, it's also possible that looking down is simply a moment of thoughtfulness or a way of recalling details, rather than a clear sign of deception. That said, when considered alongside the overall demeanor—which seemed somewhat guarded and hesitant—the downward gaze could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, a common subtle cue associated with dishonesty. While none of these observations alone definitively prove the person is lying, the combination of their physical cues and the tone of their delivery leads me to tentatively conclude that they may not be telling the full truth. Still, I would be cautious about making a firm judgment without further context or behavioral indicators.

Watching the video, the person's demeanor appears quite open and engaged. Their smile seems genuine, with the corners of the lips naturally turned up—a subtle cue often associated with sincere positive emotion. Additionally, the way they maintain gaze towards the interlocutor suggests attentiveness and a willingness to connect, which is generally consistent with honest communication. The slight head side-turn could indicate an effort to genuinely engage or consider the other person’s perspective, rather than defensiveness or evasion.

Of course, these behaviors alone can sometimes be simulated or misinterpreted. A smile and steady gaze might be performed in an attempt to appear convincing even when not telling the truth. However, the combination here doesn't strike me as forced or overly rehearsed; instead, it feels more spontaneous and relaxed. Considering both possibilities, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is most likely telling the truth, although absolute certainty is elusive without more context or corroborating evidence.

Watching the video, the person's behavior seems fairly consistent with someone who might be deceptive, but I want to consider both sides before coming to a conclusion. The gaze towards the interlocutor suggests engagement and openness, which often aligns with honesty. At the same time, the occasional gaze down could raise some questions, as looking down might sometimes be interpreted as discomfort or avoidance. However, it’s important to remember that people look down for a variety of reasons—not necessarily deception—such as gathering thoughts or recalling information.

The head side-turn is another interesting cue. While it might indicate some level of hesitation, it can also simply be a natural physical gesture during conversation or a way to process what’s being said. Taken together, these behaviors could point towards subtle discomfort. The gaze engagement is present, but the moments of looking down and the subtle head turn, on their own, could be indicative of possible evasion.

On balance, given the combination of cues and the overall demeanor, the evidence leans more towards the person potentially being deceptive. That said, it’s not an absolute certainty—I’m just making a reasoned assessment based on what’s visible.

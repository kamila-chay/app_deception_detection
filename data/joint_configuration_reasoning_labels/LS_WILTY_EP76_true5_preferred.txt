Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests a level of sincerity that aligns with the notion that they are telling the truth. Their gaze towards the interlocutor indicates engagement and openness, which often correlates with honesty. People who are truthful tend to maintain eye contact to convey confidence and transparency, so this behavior leans toward credibility.

However, it is worth considering that gaze direction alone can be misleading. For example, the individual also looks upward at times, a behavior sometimes interpreted as accessing memory or even fabricating details. This could raise doubts, as gaze aversion or looking away can be a subtle cue to discomfort or deception. Yet, when combined with the direct gaze towards the interlocutor, it may simply reflect thoughtful recollection rather than evasion.

Given these behaviors together, and weighing the possibilities, the balance seems to tip more in favor of honesty. The person’s overall engagement cues suggest they are not attempting to conceal information. While one can never be entirely certain without further context, the available behavioral indicators reasonably support the conclusion that the individual is indeed telling the truth.

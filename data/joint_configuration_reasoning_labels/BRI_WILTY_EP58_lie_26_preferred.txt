Watching the video, the person's behavior suggests some intriguing possibilities. At times, their gaze is directly fixed on the interlocutor, which typically signals engagement and honesty. However, there are noticeable moments when their eyes divert—either downward or sideways—which can often be interpreted as signs of discomfort or evasion. These shifts in gaze could potentially indicate internal conflict or an attempt to avoid fully revealing the truth.

On the other hand, it’s worth considering that gaze aversion isn’t a definitive marker of deception. People might look away when they’re thinking or processing information, and nervousness can occur even when someone is truthful. The context also matters—a nervous but honest individual might display similar behaviors.

Still, the combination of maintaining eye contact initially and then repeatedly looking away in different directions could point to a deliberate effort to manage how they present themselves. This pattern seems more consistent with someone who is not being entirely forthcoming, as opposed to someone simply lost in thought or anxious.

Taking all this into account, while I can’t say with absolute certainty, the subtle cues in their gaze behavior lean toward the likelihood that they are being less than truthful in this instance. It feels like an educated guess rather than a definitive judgment, but the evidence tilts in that direction.

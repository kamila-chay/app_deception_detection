Watching the video, there are several cues that prompted me to consider the possibility that the person is entirely truthful. For instance, their gaze shifts frequently—from looking directly at the interlocutor to glancing down or sideways—which can sometimes indicate thoughtfulness or processing information, behaviors often associated with honesty. Additionally, subtle movements of the head, like pulling it slightly backward or turning it to the side, might suggest a natural and relaxed posture or signal openness.

The person also engages in self-soothing gestures, such as touching their head or other parts of their body and occasionally covering their face or mouth, which can be signs of contemplation or careful consideration. Interestingly, their arms are open at times, which could be interpreted as a clear sign of openness and confidence, supporting the assessment. Moreover, when these seemingly confident gestures are interspersed with more guarded ones, it might reflect a thoughtful emotional state that aligns with someone who is being forthcoming.

While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove truthfulness—since people can exhibit similar signs due to nervousness or other reasons—the cluster of them together, particularly the shifts in gaze and self-contact, leans toward the interpretation that the person is likely expressing the full truth. Of course, without additional context or knowing their baseline behavior, it remains an educated guess rather than a certainty. Still, the combination of signs makes a strong case for confidence in the person’s honesty in this instance.

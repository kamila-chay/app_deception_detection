Watching this video carefully, the person’s behavior seems to present some subtle cues that might indicate they are being entirely truthful. Their chin moves upwards at times, which can sometimes be a sign of defensiveness or an attempt to assert confidence, but it could also just be a natural gesture or an effort to engage more with the interlocutor. The gaze maintained towards the person they’re speaking with seems steady, which generally suggests openness; however, steady eye contact can sometimes be deliberately held by someone trying to convince or manipulate, so it’s not an absolute indicator of honesty.

The person also nods throughout the conversation and tilts their head slightly, both of which can demonstrate engagement and agreement, but in certain contexts, such gestures might be used to persuade or mask discomfort. The head side-turn could be a subtle avoidance behavior or simply a habit in conversation. Taken together, these behaviors don’t scream deception outright, and the combination—especially with the upward chin movement coupled with the relatively restricted range of more open gestures—gives a slight impression of guardedness or a rehearsed demeanor.

Considering these points, while it’s plausible that the person might be fabricating or withholding information, the nuanced signals lean towards them possibly being truthful. This conclusion isn’t definitive but is supported by the somewhat controlled and defensive style of their body language, which can also correlate with the mental state of someone who is thoughtfully and sincerely engaging.

In observing the person's behavior, several subtle cues stand out that suggest they are likely being entirely forthcoming. The raised eyebrows could indicate an attempt to emphasize sincerity or surprise, which often serves as a genuine expression of emotion rather than a compensatory gesture. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor reflects engagement, which typically signals honesty and a sincere desire to connect. Additionally, the palms-up posture often conveys openness or a plea for trust, functioning here as an authentic expression rather than a strategic display.

Of course, these behaviors individually might not definitively indicate truthfulness, as they can occur in deceptive communication as well. People sometimes raise their eyebrows or maintain eye contact in calculated ways, and open palm gestures could be used strategically. However, the combination of these signals, especially when they appear natural and unforced, leans toward the possibility that the individual is expressing genuine intentions. Taking these factors collectively, it seems reasonable to lean toward the conclusion that the person is being truthful, while acknowledging that this assessment is based on observable cues that are not infallible.

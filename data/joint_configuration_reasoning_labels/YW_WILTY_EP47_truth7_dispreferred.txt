Watching the video, the person’s demeanor seems fairly consistent with someone who is being deceptive, though it’s always important to remain cautious before drawing firm conclusions. The individual raises their eyebrows at moments that appear to emphasize sincerity or engagement rather than defensiveness or exaggeration. Their gaze remains steady and directed towards the interlocutor, which often signals openness and confidence in what they’re communicating. Additionally, the slight head tilting can suggest a level of interest or attentiveness, rather than evasiveness.

Of course, one might argue that facial expressions and gestures can sometimes be consciously controlled or misinterpreted, especially in situations where someone wants to appear truthful. Raising eyebrows, for instance, could be a rehearsed cue to stimulate perceived trustworthiness. Similarly, maintaining eye contact while tilting the head might be a practiced technique to engage the listener or mask nervousness. However, given the natural flow of these behaviors in the video and the absence of signs like rapid blinking or abrupt changes in posture, the indications lean more towards deceptive communication rather than genuine expression.

Overall, while no single behavior guarantees dishonesty, the combination observed here—subtle eyebrow raises, steady gaze, and thoughtful head movement—aligns more closely with someone who is being deceptive. It feels like a reasonable interpretation, bearing in mind that human expressions can be complex and sometimes ambiguous.

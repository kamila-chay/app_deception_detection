Watching the video, I noticed the person frequently shifting their gaze, sometimes looking directly at the interlocutor but often glancing downward. This kind of behavior can sometimes suggest a struggle with maintaining eye contact, which is often interpreted as a sign of discomfort or possible deception. The individual also crossed their fingers at one point, a subtle but interesting gesture. Crossing fingers can be linked to a kind of subconscious reassurance or a symbolic act some people use when they are not being entirely truthful. Additionally, the person’s palms were turned upward occasionally, which might indicate an attempt to appear open or honest. Yet, when considered alongside the other behaviors, it could also be a somewhat practiced or forced display of sincerity.

While it is important to remember that none of these behaviors on their own definitively prove lying—since people can look down or cross their fingers for numerous reasons—together they paint a picture that leans toward the individual not being fully truthful. The mixture of attempts at direct gaze coupled with avoidance, combined with the finger crossing, suggests a level of internal conflict or stress associated with what they are saying. On balance, I would estimate that the person is likely lying, though I would remain cautious not to jump to conclusions without additional context.

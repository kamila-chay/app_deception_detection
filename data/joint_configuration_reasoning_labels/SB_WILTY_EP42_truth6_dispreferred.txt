Watching the video, the person’s behavior appears quite natural and consistent with someone who is being deceptive. There are multiple subtle cues that often align with dishonesty, such as the genuine smile and moments of laughter, which can sometimes mask discomfort and concealment. The frequent blinking could suggest nervousness rather than engagement, as people who are lying sometimes unconsciously increase blinking to manage stress while fabricating their story.

The facial expressions, including the upward movement of the lip corners, seem spontaneous rather than forced, which might serve to mislead and create a facade of sincerity. Additionally, the person’s gaze occasionally moves upward, possibly reflecting a rehearsed or deceptive response rather than genuine recall or thoughtfulness. Their head movements—a mix of nodding, tilting, and side turning—could be interpreted as attempts to appear engaged and genuine, rather than the more rigid or overly controlled movements associated with truthfulness.

On the other hand, some might argue that frequent head movements and blinking could be signs of engagement or comfort, which might hint at honesty. However, these behaviors can also occur in deceptive individuals who are emotionally invested in maintaining their story. The downward movement of the chin combined with occasional head shakes might seem reflective of thought or mild self-correction at first glance, but in context, they could indicate deliberate deception rather than genuine reflection.

Taking all these behavioral elements together, it seems more probable that the person is being deceptive. The overall openness and naturalness in their expressions and gestures lean towards concealment, though it’s important to acknowledge that such cues are not foolproof indicators on their own. Still, given the consistency and context, my educated guess would be that the person is not telling the truth.

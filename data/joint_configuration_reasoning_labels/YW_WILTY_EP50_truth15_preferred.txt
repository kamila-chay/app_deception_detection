Watching the video, the person’s demeanor appears quite open and engaged. Their lip corners are turned up slightly, which suggests a subtle positive emotion or comfort in the situation. Additionally, their gaze is directed toward the interlocutor, indicating an active connection and attentiveness to the interaction. These behaviors generally align with someone who is being sincere, as maintaining eye contact and displaying a relaxed facial expression often correlate with truthfulness.

That said, there is also a noticeable moment when their gaze shifts upward. While some might interpret looking up as a sign of fabrication or searching for a constructed response, it can also simply reflect the person recalling information or thinking carefully. This moment of gaze aversion isn’t prolonged or paired with other deceptive cues, so it doesn’t strongly undermine the impression of honesty.

Considering these points together, the weight of the behavior leans toward the person telling the truth. Their mostly engaged and calm demeanor, highlighted by the positive facial expression and steady eye contact, supports this assessment. Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that nonverbal cues are not foolproof indicators and can vary depending on individual habits or context. Nonetheless, given the overall presentation, it seems most reasonable to conclude that the person is being truthful in this interaction.

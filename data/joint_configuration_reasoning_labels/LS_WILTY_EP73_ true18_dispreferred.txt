Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests they might be lying. For instance, the raised eyebrows could be interpreted as a sign of genuine engagement or emphasis, which often accompanies sincere communication. Additionally, maintaining gaze toward the interlocutor generally indicates openness and a desire to connect, both of which can support honesty.

Of course, it’s important to consider that raised eyebrows might also occur if someone is surprised or attempting to emphasize a point, regardless of truthfulness. Similarly, a direct gaze can sometimes be used strategically to appear convincing, even when someone is not being truthful. However, given the combination of these behaviors together—raised eyebrows paired with consistent eye contact—the overall impression leans toward insincerity in this context.

While no single behavior guarantees deception, the subtle nonverbal cues here align more closely with dishonest engagement rather than sincerity. So although I can't be entirely certain without more information, based on what I observed, I would lean toward the conclusion that the person is indeed lying.

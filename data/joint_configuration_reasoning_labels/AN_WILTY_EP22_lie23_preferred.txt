Observing the person's behavior in the video, a few cues stand out that might help us gauge their truthfulness. The individual maintains eye contact with their interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and honesty. Nodding can also be interpreted as a sign of agreement or affirmation, reinforcing the idea that the person is aligned with their statements. Additionally, the palms up gesture is typically seen as an open and sincere gesture, indicating a willingness to be transparent.

However, despite these seemingly truthful signals, there is room for skepticism. Skilled individuals who are attempting to deceive might deliberately use positive nonverbal behaviors to appear credible and trustworthy. The consistent gaze toward the interlocutor, while generally positive, can sometimes be employed as a calculated effort to establish connection and avoid suspicion. Similarly, nodding could be an intentional tactic to encourage agreement or prompt positive reinforcement, rather than an authentic sign of honesty. The open-handed gesture, while often genuine, can also be mimicked as a way to disarm the listener.

Considering these points, and knowing that the person is lying, it appears that their body language is more strategic than spontaneous. Instead of revealing genuine emotions or honesty, these behaviors seem more like carefully controlled signals designed to convince the other party of their truthfulness. While normally such cues might suggest sincerity, in this context, they might be deliberate attempts to mask deception. Therefore, the balance of evidence leans towards the person being untruthful despite their seemingly honest demeanor.

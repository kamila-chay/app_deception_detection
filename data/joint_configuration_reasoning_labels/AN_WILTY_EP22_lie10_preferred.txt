Watching the video closely, the person's behavior presents some interesting cues that suggest the possibility of deception, though it's not definitive at first glance. The individual maintains gaze towards the interlocutor, which could be interpreted as an attempt to appear sincere and engaged—typically a sign of honesty. They also nod and tilt their head, gestures commonly associated with agreement and attentiveness, which might indicate that the person is trying to reinforce the credibility of what they’re saying.

However, the subtle crossing of fingers is a notable detail that raises some doubts. This gesture is often associated with concealing dishonesty or wishing for luck when one is not entirely truthful. While it's easy to dismiss the finger crossing as a benign or unconscious action, within the context of other behaviors, it suggests an underlying tension or conflict between what is expressed verbally and what is actually true. 

Considering these behaviors together, it seems plausible that the individual is attempting to convince the interlocutor through direct eye contact and affirming gestures, yet the crossing of fingers hints at a lack of full transparency. This conflicting set of signals makes me lean toward the conclusion that the person is lying, but I acknowledge that without additional context or verbal cues, there is always room for alternative interpretations.

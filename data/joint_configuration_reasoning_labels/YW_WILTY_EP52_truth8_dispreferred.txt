Watching the video, the person's behavior seems fairly consistent with someone who is lying, though there are a few nuances worth considering. For instance, their facial expressions include laughter and raising of the eyebrows, which can often indicate openness and engagement rather than deceit. The laughter might suggest a level of comfort or naturalness in the conversation, which aligns with truthful communication. Additionally, the person’s gaze tends to shift towards their interlocutor and sometimes upwards, which could be interpreted in a couple of ways. Direct gaze usually signifies honesty and confidence, whereas looking upward can sometimes be linked to accessing memories, which would be expected if they’re recounting true experiences. The gesture of palms facing upward also tends to convey sincerity and a lack of concealment. 

On the other hand, some might argue that certain eye movements or gestures could be rehearsed or used to mask uncertainty, complicating a straightforward assessment. However, taken as a whole, the combination of these behaviors feels more calculated and consistent with someone fabricating rather than speaking truthfully. While there’s no absolute certainty without corroborating evidence, the observable cues lean towards a deceptive exchange in this case.

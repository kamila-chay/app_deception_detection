Watching the video closely, the person exhibits several behaviors that might initially appear ambiguous when trying to determine their truthfulness. For instance, the raised eyebrows could indicate surprise or disbelief, but they might also simply reflect engagement or emphasis in what they’re saying. The downward pull at the corners of the lips and the protruded lips could be interpreted as signs of discomfort or uncertainty, which sometimes raise suspicion. Additionally, the sideways gaze and the head movements—both tilting and turning—might suggest evasiveness or an attempt to avoid direct eye contact, a common hint at dishonesty.

However, none of these behaviors conclusively point to deception on their own. Raised eyebrows, while occasionally a sign of surprise or doubt, can just as easily be a natural reaction or part of normal facial expressions when emphasizing a point. Lip movements that might seem like signs of unease might just as well be spontaneous or habitual gestures without any deceptive intent. The sideways gaze and head turns might not be indicative of lying but could reflect thinking, processing information, or simply the individual's comfortable mannerisms during conversation.

Given the context that the person is telling the truth, it’s reasonable to conclude that these behaviors are more likely idiosyncratic to the individual than cues of deceit. While it would be easy to suspect dishonesty from such signals, considering them in isolation without the wider context or additional corroborating evidence can lead to mistaken judgments. Overall, the subtle signs present seem more consistent with a truthful statement accompanied by natural, perhaps slightly nervous, but genuine nonverbal communication rather than calculated deception.

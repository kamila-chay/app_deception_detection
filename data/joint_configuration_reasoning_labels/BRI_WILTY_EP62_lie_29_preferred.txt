Watching the video, the person’s behavior caught my attention in a few ways that suggest they might not be entirely truthful. Their eyebrows are furrowed, which often signals some form of discomfort or cognitive effort—something that can happen when someone is trying to fabricate or modify information. At the same time, I noticed that their gaze often shifts upwards rather than away or downward, which some theories suggest could indicate they are constructing a response rather than recalling a genuine memory. Interestingly, they maintain gaze toward the interlocutor rather than avoiding eye contact, which could be an attempt to appear sincere and maintain control of the conversation. 

On the other hand, it's worth considering that frowning can also stem from concentration or frustration unrelated to deception, and the direct gaze might just reflect engagement or confidence rather than deceit. People vary widely in how they show stress or lie, so none of these behaviors alone conclusively prove dishonesty. Still, taken together—the combination of the furrowed brow, the upward gaze, and a steady but potentially calculated eye contact pattern—these cues collectively lean towards the person struggling to be truthful. While it’s never possible to be 100% certain based on behavior alone, the evidence here reasonably supports the notion that the person is not being entirely honest.

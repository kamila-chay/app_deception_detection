Watching the video, the person’s behavior strikes me as somewhat contradictory, which raises some doubts about the veracity of their statements. On one hand, they maintain eye contact with the interlocutor, which might traditionally suggest honesty or engagement. However, this gaze is intermittently broken with sideways glances and a noticeable head turn to the side, which could imply discomfort or an attempt to avoid scrutiny. The frequent blinking further adds to this impression, often linked to cognitive stress or the effort to fabricate a story, though it can sometimes be a simple sign of nervousness.

Their facial expressions are mixed as well; the slight upward curl at the lip corners might be interpreted as a social smile, attempting to appear sincere, yet the lips are also protruded at times, which can be an unconscious distancing or a subtle sign of resistance. The chin movements, specifically a subtle upward tilt, could be a gesture of defensiveness or self-assurance meant to mask uncertainty.

Moreover, their hand movements seem somewhat restless, with scratching and touching of various parts of the body noticeable throughout. Such behaviors often accompany feelings of anxiety or internal conflict, though some might argue they simply reflect habitual gestures or the need to relieve tension from prolonged speaking.

Taking all this into account, the inconsistent and somewhat uneasy nonverbal cues lean towards the possibility that the person is not being entirely truthful. Nonetheless, given the ambiguity inherent in interpreting these signals, there is room to consider that this behavior could stem from nervousness unrelated to deceit. Still, weighing all the subtle contradictions and signs of discomfort, my educated guess leans toward the conclusion that the individual is likely lying.

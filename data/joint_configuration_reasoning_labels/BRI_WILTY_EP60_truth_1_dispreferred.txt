Watching the video, the person’s behavior appears somewhat unnatural and inconsistent with someone who is being truthful. Their facial expressions, particularly the laughter and the subtle lifting of the lip corners, could suggest a forced or superficial emotional response. This kind of spontaneous reaction tends to be easier to fake convincingly when someone is lying, as it may mask an underlying discomfort with the situation.

In addition, the person’s gaze is mostly directed towards the interlocutor, which can sometimes indicate engagement but may also be used deliberately to create an impression of transparency. While there are moments where their gaze shifts downward or sideways, these could be interpreted as moments of evasiveness rather than natural breaks in eye contact. It’s common for deceptive individuals to look away briefly as they construct responses or conceal details.

Of course, one could argue that some eye movements, like looking down or sideways, might suggest thoughtfulness or a normal part of conversation. However, given the overall controlled demeanor, the presence of arguably forced laughter, and consistent engagement with the interlocutor, these occasional glances away seem more like attempts to manage impressions than signs of openness.

Taking all these behavioral cues into account, I would lean towards the assessment that the person is likely being untruthful, though I acknowledge there’s always a degree of uncertainty in interpreting nonverbal signals alone. The combination of affected affect and mostly direct gaze points more toward deception than honesty in this case.

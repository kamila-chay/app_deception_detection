Watching the video, the person’s behavior strikes me as somewhat ambiguous but leans toward being deceptive. There are moments where they laugh, which on the surface might signal friendliness or ease, but combined with their lip corners turning down, it suggests an undercurrent of discomfort or insincerity. The upward movement of the chin, a subtle gesture, could be interpreted as a defensive or assertive signal, possibly an attempt to mask vulnerability. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which might typically indicate honesty or engagement; however, it can also be a tactic to overcompensate for deceit by maintaining eye contact. The palms facing upward appear open, a gesture often linked to honesty or openness, but when juxtaposed with the other conflicting cues, it might actually be a rehearsed or forced display rather than a genuine sign. Considering all this together, it seems more likely they are concealing the truth rather than expressing it openly. That said, these behaviors can be context-dependent and subject to interpretation, so while the evidence suggests lying, it is not conclusive beyond doubt.

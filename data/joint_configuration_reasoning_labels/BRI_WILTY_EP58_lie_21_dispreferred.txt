Watching the video, I noticed that the person frequently raised their eyebrows while maintaining steady eye contact with the interlocutor. On one hand, raising eyebrows can be a natural response to emphasize a point or show engagement, and maintaining gaze suggests confidence and honesty. However, some research indicates that these subtle facial movements, especially when combined, might serve as a guard to mask underlying discomfort or deceit. The raised eyebrows could be a deliberate attempt to appear more sincere and open, while the steady gaze might be controlled to avoid suspicion. Considering these nuances, it feels likely that the person is being entirely truthful, though these behaviors alone don’t definitively prove honesty. Still, given the context and the manner in which these expressions occur, it leans toward the person likely telling the truth.

Watching this person closely, certain subtle cues catch my attention that might suggest they are not being entirely truthful. The frequent raising of eyebrows combined with slight movements of the chin—sometimes upwards, sometimes downwards—could indicate underlying discomfort or an attempt to control how they are perceived. Their gaze is notably shifting; at times they look directly at the person they are speaking with, which might be an effort to connect and appear sincere, but then they glance down or shift their head to the side, behaviors often linked to cognitive effort or hesitation.

That said, none of these signals alone definitively prove deception, as raising eyebrows or changing head positions could also be responses to stress, embarrassment, or simply thinking through a question carefully. However, when these behaviors appear together and in close succession, especially alongside changes in gaze, it raises a reasonable suspicion that the person might be crafting their story rather than recounting a straightforward truth.

Taking all these observations into account, I lean toward the conclusion that the person is likely lying, though I recognize that without additional context or corroborating information, this remains an informed estimation rather than an absolute certainty.

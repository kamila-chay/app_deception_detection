Watching the video, the person’s behavior gives mixed signals at first glance, which makes it a bit challenging to firmly conclude whether they are telling the truth. The closed mouth and awkward pauses might suggest some hesitation or discomfort, which can sometimes be associated with deception. Lips protruding and a sideways gaze are often interpreted as signs of evasiveness or even fabrication, as people might avoid direct eye contact when they are not being truthful. However, such behaviors can also stem from nervousness or social anxiety, especially in situations where one feels scrutinized, even if they are being honest.

On the other hand, the person’s nodding seems to indicate affirmation and could be seen as a sign of sincerity, as they appear to be engaging with what they are saying or acknowledging the truthfulness of their statements. While nodding alone is not definitive proof of honesty, it somewhat counters the more suspicious cues. Given these observations, I lean toward the person being truthful, understanding that their nonverbal cues may reflect discomfort rather than deceit. It’s important to remember that behaviors like gaze aversion and pauses don’t exclusively signal lying—they can also arise from the natural complexity of human communication and the pressure of the situation. So, while there are moments that invite skepticism, the overall impression points more to honesty than falsehood.

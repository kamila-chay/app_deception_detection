After carefully observing the video, the person's behavior suggests a complex mix of signals that could point to deception, although it's not entirely straightforward. Their chin moving upwards combined with head movements—both forward and backward—could indicate an internal conflict or discomfort, which is often seen when someone is trying to fabricate or manipulate information. The gaze towards the interlocutor might normally signal engagement and honesty, but in this context, it could also be a deliberate attempt to maintain control of the conversation or to appear sincere.

The head tilting and the frequent touching of their own body or head may reflect nervousness or self-soothing gestures, behaviors that can arise when someone is anxious about being truthful. On the other hand, their arms being open might suggest openness, which could be a natural posture or a subconscious way to appear more honest and inviting.

While none of these behaviors on their own definitively proves lying, the combination, especially the physical signs of tension and self-comfort mixed with controlled eye contact, leans me toward the conclusion that they're not being fully truthful. The intricacy of these signals makes it difficult to be absolutely certain, and it’s plausible that the person could just be nervous or uncomfortable for reasons unrelated to deception. However, given the overall pattern and the subtle cues, the educated guess would be that the individual is likely lying.

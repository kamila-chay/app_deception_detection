Watching the video, the person’s behavior seems generally consistent with someone who is being honest. They maintain their gaze toward the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and openness rather than deception. The occasional gaze down doesn’t necessarily imply dishonesty either; it can simply indicate thoughtfulness or processing information. Additionally, their nodding appears natural, reinforcing the impression that they are attentive and agreeable rather than evasive.

The palms-up gesture tends to be an open, non-threatening signal, often associated with sincerity and a willingness to communicate openly. This further supports the idea that the person is not attempting to hide anything.

Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that behaviors like gaze aversion can sometimes be linked to lying, and gestures can vary widely by individual and context. Yet, in this instance, the combination of these cues leans more toward honesty than deceit. Taking all these elements into account, it seems reasonable to conclude that the person is likely telling the truth.

Watching the video, the person's behavior offers some subtle cues that invite careful consideration. Their chin moves downwards at certain points, accompanied by a gaze directed downward. These actions could be interpreted in a few ways. On one hand, lowering the chin and gaze might indicate discomfort or an attempt to avoid eye contact, which some might associate with dishonesty. It could also suggest uncertainty or hesitation, potentially raising questions about the veracity of their statements.

However, these same behaviors can also reflect introspection or thoughtful reflection, especially when someone is recounting truthful information that requires careful recall. The downward gaze and chin movement might simply be a natural way of processing their thoughts internally before expressing them. Given that the person is known to be telling the truth, it’s reasonable to think these gestures are more about cognitive effort than deception.

While the possibility of these movements signaling deceit cannot be completely dismissed in a different context, here they seem consistent with someone who is truthful but perhaps a bit self-conscious or reflective. So, although it’s never possible to be entirely certain by behavior alone, the balance of evidence and the known fact that the person is truthful point toward these mannerisms being genuine signs of honesty rather than deception.

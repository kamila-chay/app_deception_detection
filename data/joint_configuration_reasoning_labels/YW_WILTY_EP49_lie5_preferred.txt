Observing the individual in the video, their gaze consistently remains directed at the interlocutor, which often suggests engagement and openness in conversation. Moreover, the use of palms-up gestures typically conveys honesty or an attempt to appear sincere. At face value, these behaviors could be interpreted as genuine signals of truthfulness.

However, considering the context where the person is suspected of deception, these behaviors might serve as deliberate attempts to mask dishonesty. Maintaining eye contact can sometimes be a conscious effort to convince the listener of one’s truthfulness, rather than a natural sign of honesty. Similarly, open palm gestures can be strategically employed to project trustworthiness even when the speaker is being deceptive.

Weighing these interpretations, while the person’s behavior outwardly aligns with indicators of honesty, it is plausible that these same behaviors are being used to manipulate the perception of truthfulness. Given the suspicion and the potential for such gestures to be consciously controlled, I lean towards the conclusion that the individual is likely not being truthful. Still, without additional cues or context, this assessment remains an informed hypothesis rather than a definitive judgment.

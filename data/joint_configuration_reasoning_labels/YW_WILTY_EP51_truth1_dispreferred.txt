Watching the video, the person's demeanor appears relatively open and engaged, which might suggest honesty. The raised eyebrows could imply a degree of surprise or emphasis on certain points, potentially indicating that they are genuinely invested in what they are saying. Their gaze directed towards the interlocutor seems consistent with someone who is following the conversation closely and feeling comfortable, which often aligns with truthful communication.

However, the head moving backward might typically be interpreted as a subtle sign of distancing or discomfort, which could raise questions about sincerity. On the other hand, it may simply reflect a natural reaction to a particular statement or an attempt to gather thoughts, rather than an intentional signal of deception.

Balancing these observations, the cues lean more towards honesty than deceit. While none of these behaviors definitively prove truthfulness on their own, taken together, they form a pattern that seems more consistent with someone being truthful rather than deceptive. Considering all this, my educated guess is that the person is telling the truth, though it's important to recognize that nonverbal behavior can be influenced by many factors unrelated to veracity.

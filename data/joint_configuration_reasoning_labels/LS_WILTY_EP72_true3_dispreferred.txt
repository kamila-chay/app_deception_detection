Watching the video, the person’s behavior suggests a certain level of openness and perhaps some mild uncertainty. Their gaze shifts towards the interlocutor, which typically aligns with someone engaging in honest communication, as direct eye contact can indicate sincerity. However, there are moments when they look down, which can sometimes raise trust; people might look away when processing information or reflecting. Yet, looking away isn’t an exclusively positive sign—it could also signal thoughtfulness or simply processing the question.

The occasional shrug adds an interesting layer—it can come off as a sign of uncertainty or lack of complete knowledge, but it doesn’t automatically imply deception. Someone telling the truth might shrug to acknowledge limitations or express a degree of humility about their statement.

Taking all these factors into account, it seems more likely that the person is being truthful. Their gaze towards the interlocutor, combined with the thoughtful downward glances and non-defensive body language, fits the typical patterns of someone expressing honesty. While none of these behaviors alone guarantees honesty, the overall impression is consistent with a genuine response rather than fabrication. Of course, without additional context or further behavioral signs, there remains a small margin for doubt, but the evidence leans toward the person telling the truth.

Watching the video carefully, I notice that the person exhibits a few key nonverbal cues that can shed some light on their honesty. They frequently raise their eyebrows and nod while speaking, which often suggests openness and engagement in the conversation. The person's gaze is directed towards their interlocutor for the most part, indicating a level of confidence and willingness to connect, which can be consistent with telling the truth. At times, the gaze shifts upward, which some might interpret as a sign of constructing a story or recalling information.

However, given the overall context and the combination of behaviors, it seems quite likely that these upward glances reflect genuine recall rather than deception. When people lie, they often avoid eye contact or show signs of discomfort, but here, the sustained gaze and nodding support the notion of sincerity. Raising eyebrows can also signal surprise or emphasis, both of which align with truthful communication.

While none of these cues on their own guarantees honesty, the interplay of direct gaze, affirmative nodding, and expressive eyebrow movements collectively suggest that this person is indeed telling the truth. There's always some room for doubt—after all, nonverbal cues are never foolproof—but based on what I observe, the behavior is consistent with honest communication rather than deception.

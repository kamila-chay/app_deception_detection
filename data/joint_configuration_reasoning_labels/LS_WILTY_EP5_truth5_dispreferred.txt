Watching the video closely, the individual's behavior initially gives mixed signals when considering truthfulness. The downward pull of the lip corners and the protrusion of the lips can sometimes be associated with discomfort or uncertainty, which might lead one to question their honesty at first glance. Additionally, a gaze directed downward can often be interpreted as evasiveness or a sign of deceit.

However, these same behaviors can also stem from genuine emotions like sadness, contemplation, or nervousness unrelated to lying. People telling the truth are not immune to feeling uneasy, especially under scrutiny or in stressful situations. The subtle tension in the face and the downward gaze might simply reflect internal processing or concern about how their message will be received, rather than an attempt to deceive.

Balancing these considerations, it seems more plausible that the person is indeed being dishonest. The behaviors observed could be consistent with an attempt to mask the truth rather than a natural emotional response. While there are cues that might suggest genuine emotion, none definitively confirm honesty on their own. Therefore, based on the overall impression and understanding of deceptive individuals’ possible nonverbal reactions, I would lean toward the conclusion that the person’s statements are untruthful, though I remain open to alternative interpretations given the ambiguity of such cues.

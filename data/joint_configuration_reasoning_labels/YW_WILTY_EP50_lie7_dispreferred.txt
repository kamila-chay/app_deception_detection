Watching the video, the person's body language strikes me as somewhat ambiguous, though there are some subtle cues that suggest they might be entirely truthful. For instance, their eyebrows rise at certain points, which can sometimes indicate surprise or uncertainty, but it can also be a deliberate attempt to appear more sincere or engaged. Their gaze remains fixed on the interlocutor, which one might interpret as a sign of honesty or confidence; however, maintaining steady eye contact can also be a conscious effort to convince or mislead.

Additionally, the individual’s arms are open, a posture often linked to openness and receptivity, which might make them seem more trustworthy. Yet, this openness could also be a strategic move to appear transparent, especially if the person is aware they’re under scrutiny.

While none of these behaviors alone definitively prove honesty, taken together and considering the context, there is a reasonable basis to believe that the person is fully forthright. Of course, it’s important to remember that body language can be influenced by many factors, including nervousness or habit, so while the signs lean towards honesty, I would hesitate to conclude without further information. Still, given the combination of raised eyebrows, sustained gaze, and open arms, it seems more likely than not that the person is telling the truth.

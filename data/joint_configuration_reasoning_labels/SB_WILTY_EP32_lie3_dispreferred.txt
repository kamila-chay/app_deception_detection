Watching the video, there are a few subtle cues that might suggest the person is being entirely truthful. The gaze directed upward can sometimes indicate that someone is trying to access genuine memories or recall detailed information rather than fabricating details. Coupled with the head held up, which may be an attempt to project confidence or credibility, these behaviors could point toward a sincere effort to communicate honestly rather than to convince artificially.

On the other hand, these same gestures might also be interpreted differently depending on context; for instance, looking up could simply mean the individual is thinking or recalling a distant memory rather than inventing something. The open arms posture typically conveys openness and honesty, which supports the trustworthiness suggested by other cues.

However, considering the combination of these behaviors, especially the gaze direction and head position, it leans more toward an effort to deliver information transparently rather than to construct or manipulate it. While none of these signs alone can definitively prove truthfulness, the convergence of these subtle signals leads me to reasonably believe that the person in this video is telling the truth. It's an educated assessment rather than a certainty, but the behavioral pattern does support honesty.

Watching the video, certain behavioral cues stand out that could suggest the person is not being entirely truthful. The furrowed eyebrows and occasional head tilting might indicate discomfort or cognitive effort, which people often exhibit when fabricating information. The frequent blinking and sideways gaze can be interpreted as signs of nervousness or attempts to avoid direct confrontation, which are sometimes linked to dishonest behavior. The individual's hands are notably active, touching their face or head, which often serves as a self-soothing mechanism when someone feels anxious or under pressure.

That said, it’s important to consider alternative explanations. For instance, the person might simply be feeling stressed or anxious due to the situation rather than intentionally lying. The frowning and head movements could just as well reflect confusion or deep thought. However, taken together, the combination and frequency of these behaviors lean towards the possibility of deception rather than mere discomfort or stress.

While none of these cues alone definitively prove dishonesty, the overall pattern aligns with what psychological research often associates with lying. Therefore, although I can’t be absolutely certain, I would reasonably conclude that the person is likely not telling the truth in this context.
